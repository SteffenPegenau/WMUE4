The middle and end was great.
I also loved the setting of the book.
I got this book a couple of days ago and I enojoyed reading it.
I would recommend this book to 7th and 8th graders.
I hope everyone who reads this review also reads the book.
This book was a number one book because of its emotional feel on me and its a very addicting to read.
I can't wait to read the next book.
My favorite character Mumpo was odd but kind hearted.
Its such a beautiful and wonderful place.
Remember never judge a book by its cover.
It was a book that I couldn't put down.
They did have alot of emotion and feel.
This is book perfect for enjoyment and as a book report.
The characters were the best, but they didn't have alot of description.
I really liked the book but the beginging was alittle bit on the down side.

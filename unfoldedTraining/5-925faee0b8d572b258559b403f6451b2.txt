I think it's classic Futurama.
I've now watched it three times and I keep laughing.
I thought it would be funnier, quicker moving, etc.
Not great.
Whatever the case, two days after my initial viewing, I put it back in the DVD player and watched it again.
It really grew on me.
Maybe I was just setting my expectations too high.
I'm looking forward to more direct-to-DVD movies being released.
I was a little disappointed.
I hope they bring this back to television soon!
There were things I missed from the first viewing.
I watched it and thought it was good.
I have to say that I was so excited to finally receive my version of Bender's Big Score.
I found myself laughing a lot more.
I'm a die hard fan, as many people writing reviews here are.

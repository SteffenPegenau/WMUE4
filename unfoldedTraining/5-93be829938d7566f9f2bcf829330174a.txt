I search for my item and "ZIP"!
The "Look-up" feature for definitions for words your not familiar with is fantastic!!
I recommend that everyone buy and download the "Kindle Users Guide".
There they are in less then 30 seconds on my Kindle.
I often find myself in the most peculiar reading situations and positions!
Everyone should have a Kindle!!
I have not had the opportunity to use the scan documents feature or the email.
Everyone needs a KINDLE!
OMGOODNESS!!!
The minute I see a book or CD's I might want, I quick go to my kindle and log into the "Kindle Store".
I read on the average at least 10 books all at the same time.
!
The Kindle is wonderful for my reading habits.
Now, the music has to be down loaded to your computer and then load them onto your Kindle.
Buttt...!
;) I LOVE this thing!!
I carry my Kindle every where!

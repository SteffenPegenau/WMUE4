At other times, I wish that we would be able to hear a little more aggressive side of this fantastic rapper.
Now the cons.
The words outshine the beats on this album.
The album is witty, shocking, and downright hilarious at times.
Some songs certainly outshine others.
The best song on the entire album is 97' Bonnie and Clyde, along with great moments from I'm Shady, Role Model, My Fault, and As the World Turns.
Definitely one of the better producing jobs by Dr. Dre or Eminem.
For the best experience, turn the bass off on that player.
Let's all start with the pros for this album.
They are not very good.
One problem is the skits.
Even the ridiculously popular and catchy My Name Is can become boring after several listens.
To close out, buy this album if Eminem is your favorite artist, or you love rap like me.
At others, it can be lame.
However, this is Eminem's first and most joyful album, which is sometimes a sigh of relief.

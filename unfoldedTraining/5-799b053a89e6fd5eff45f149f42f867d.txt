He remind me so much of my dad that was in a retirement center.
I read this book in three days!
The first beginning chapters kinda confused me cause it bounced around in time.
Give it a chance.
I was saddend to see where one person had said that they were dissapointed in this book and it was a let down.
A friend of mine lended me this book and I have to say at first I was not interested in reading it.

This author really did a great job in writing this book.
I'm not good at writing reviews but I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed this book.
You will not regret it.
You won't regret it!

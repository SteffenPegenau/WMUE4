And 2 of my most favorite series are A Series of Unfortunate Events and Harry Potter.
My teacher who has over 3,000 books in her classroom reccomended this book.
He was very slow in his writings.
But I do reccomend Only You Can Save Mankind ( Terry Pratchet).
Get off the computer and read a book!
And he overloads a tad on his British sense of humor.If you like it thats great.
But it was very dull and boring for me.
It it's a great book about a computer game with connections to aliens.
Reading Rocks.
No offense to all 14 or some 4 or 5 star reviews.
And I also like Terry Pratchett.
Inkheart and The Theif Lord are my personal favorites.
bUT THIS WAS A FLAT OUT DISSAPOINTMENT.
I also reccomend any book by Cornelia Funke.
I quit after the 1st 30 pages.

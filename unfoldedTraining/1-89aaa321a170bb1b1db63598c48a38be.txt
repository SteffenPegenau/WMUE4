Here's mine.
If they aren't PUNK... then what the heck are they?
OKAY!!
But, still.
Everyone has their own opinion, right?
And, they all stink.
And, no, I'm not saying that all that other stupidity isn't punk or anything.
Bet they have a heck of alot more talent then you and they're stinkin' trying.
They certainly ARE NOT pop, or any of that other stupid type of music... and you obviously don't know what the heck you're talking about, so shut up and sit your bottom down.
They're two whatever bands.
THE HECK punk is dead, ya dumb retard.
You little stupidheads that like Sum41 and Blink182... let me ask you something.
Anyways, I'm out.
There's no need to go off and make fun, or like Blink182, or Sum41, now is there?
The pop generation is going downhill, and punk is rising.

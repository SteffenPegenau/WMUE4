Why?
Co-written by Bjork, the song itself is great.
And once again, Madonna shines through and proves to us that she's capable of anything.
But Bjork is not R&B.
The theme of this album is R&B.
The entire album is of an R&B feel with the exception of the title track.
And then it disappeared never to be heard again.
This song belongs on the "Ray of Light" album.
The song "Bedtime Story" is not R&B at all.
I can't stand the radio myself, but my question is why did Madonna put such an eccentric song which is clearly electronica, on an R&B album?
It's electronica, Bjork style.
But there's one exception.
I heard it on the radio ONE time.
Bjork is not "radio" material.
"Bedtime Story" was a single.
Because it's too weird for the general public.

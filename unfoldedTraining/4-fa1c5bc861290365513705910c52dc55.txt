If you are looking for an album with tight ass breaks mixed flawlessly, then this is a great set.
I have listened to it plenty of times and it's really grooving.
The Therapy Sessions track selection is a little better, which is why i gave this 4 stars, but it's still a must hear.
This CD is not terrible, get your heads out of the gutter, or open your mind just a little.
I play this CD in my living room when I have people over sometimes and everyone loves it and always asks, "Who is this?
If you like his set from Dave Seaman's Therapy Sessions you should like this!
Try it!
It's so tight."
PHIL K I say!
From dark funky breaky beats to some great breaky vocal sampling tracks.
This is his style, and the songs kick.
I know I'm not the only one that thinks this.
I honestly do not think this album deserves 1 star.
;D
if you are a fan of Phil K then you should not miss out on this.

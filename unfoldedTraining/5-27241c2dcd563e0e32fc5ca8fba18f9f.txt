This album is off the hook.
'i Do" will make you say I do.
I love DruHIll anyway, but man.
You can't beat that.
You get to hear all of them on this album.
It's like a free gift.
It got something for the playas, the religious, and the lovers.
"Ishould BE" Let me stop, this album is just tight.
Jam on!
That helped set it off.
I appreciate that they don't let just one person sing every song on the album, and give the others a hook every once in a while like some groups.
A new member!
Jam on DruHill!
All five!
They done it again.

What a shame!
The only reason I give it 3 stars is because the ease of use.
I should have listen to the masses and tried NERO 6.
I have a very powerful Gateway, brand new, fully loaded.
Mike Tyson off his medication is MORE stable than this piece of dung!!!
It seems like such a user friendly product, but has a lot of bugs.
And NO!!!
Let's face it!!!
!
Everything else seems to work except Pinnacle Studio 9.
Other than that....1 STAR!!!
Constant program errors cause program to shut down.
It's not my PC!
The program is more unstable even AFTER I downloaded the patch from Pinnacle web site.
Though it is easy to use, you better save your work every, let's say, 30 seconds or so!
Worst $$$ I ever spent!!

It has changed my daily routine.
I like that it lifts off the motor easily.
I love this blender.
It's nice when you blend things and don't find chunks in the final product.
Sometimes several times a day.
So many great things if I don't stop now I may be writing all day.
I definitely eat more fruits and veggies now that I have this blender.
My favorite is to make juices and smoothies.
I did a lot of research before choosing this blender.
It's powerful (although once I had to send it back to the manufacturer after 6 months to get fixed, this was free except for the shipping, it's now back to full speed again).
I love that I can get more nutrition with this blender than a juicer because it keeps in all the healthy fiber!
I like the different cycles.
Although for some vegetables, it wouldn't be so bad to have a juicer as well, sometimes its a little too much fiber.
I like that it turns off automatically.
You can do so many things with it.
I use it almost every day.

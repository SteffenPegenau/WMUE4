It's gospel, but not as you'd expect.
This could've at least made gold.
It also includes the lyrics in case you don't know what they are.
Instead, it remains virtually ignored by the general public.
That's correct.
Buy it if you can; I hope you won't be disappointed by it, and God bless you!
It's more of a prayer type of song.
It is a great Christmas gift that I recently got.
Please Jesus(Send My Baby Home To Me) is the best on here.
I'm Playing For You did have a lot of piano.
Hoss Allen Seque(how do you prononce it) is basically radio programming.
This is excellent and diverse material.
Better Off With The Blues was really blusey...no wonder it didn't do well on the charts.
Please don't let the fact that it didn't gain much promotion get to you.
True Believer was his last top 50 hit, barely making top 30(deserved better).

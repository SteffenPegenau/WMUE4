This is over-comercialized bubble gum, electronic, computer-stimulated TRASH.
Shes singing the word "sex" over and over again to appear more grown up or sexy or whatever.
People call Britney a "pop artist".
Her vocals are flat and boring and the same for each song.
Check out Avril Lavigne or Skye Sweetnam if you want rock/soft rock.
Well, look how she ended up.
They make you want to get up and dance.
Anything but this.
This is not pop.
Check out Vanessa Carlton or Michelle Branch or Kelly Clarkson if you want pop.
Listen to Michelle Branch or Vanessa Carlton.I admit, these songs are pretty catchy.
No, just no.
But the lyrics are disguisting and meaningless.
Pregnant with twins.please, don't buy this.
You wanna listen to some real pop?

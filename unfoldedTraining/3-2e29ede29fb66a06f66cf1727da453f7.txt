Clifton Davis has a great voice and some fine opportunities to show it off.
The Perfect Broadway Voice.
What a marvelous voice.
The actresses playing Julia and Sylvia are awful, awful singers.
I'd buy it again for Raul Julia's numbers.
The vocals.
Huge, delicious, expressive, alive, sensual, with that undiluted accent.
I get the feeling he may have been the show stealer here.I bought it for some of the funky, brass-heavy arrangements and the heavy nostalgia element.
I bought this 20 years later and found that I pretty much still knew the whole thing by heart.OK.
The score has some marvelous energy and a lot of silliness/camp.
Full, warm, vibrant.Raul Julia.
This is a nostalgic favorite because my high school did a bfd production of it and man, was it fun.
His charm is palpable here.
Which is a shame because most of Julia's songs are dynamite.
Even the sillliest songs are full of wit and charm.
Really bad.

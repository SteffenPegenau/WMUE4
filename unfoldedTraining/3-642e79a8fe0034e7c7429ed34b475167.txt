Is the author in heat?Frankly, I find the main male characters more interesting than Anita Blake.
Shame on YOU.Buy this is you want romance.
Also I felt there were a few loose ends designed JUST to force you to pick up the next book.
If you want vampires, horror, plot go to Anne Rice, Tanya Huff or P.N.
Most of the time Blake seems to be more worried about her love life.
I want to know more about Richard, Jean-Claude and Edward than the main female character.
There are lots of scenes where sex almost happens but does not.
Shapeshifters are being killed, Anita Blake is trapped between Richard, a werewolf, and Jean-Claude, the Master Vampire, and Edward has shown up.
Why?
Times should be rocking but the book is pretty boring.
Oh, this review is going to get so edited.
Because she is boring me.
Page after page of hot, sexy, non-nothing action.
There is NO action, no sex, few fight scenes and she STILL seems to be getting her butt kicked a lot.

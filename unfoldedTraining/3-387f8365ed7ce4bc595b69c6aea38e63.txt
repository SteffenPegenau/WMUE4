Like Ali.
But the Commentry is terrable.
Ok so now you start playing.
You have to defend the title constently and you keep playing the same contestents.
Once you in the game the graphics are pretty good.
The game becomes tiresome as once you become the champ, The Number 1.
Well when I bought this game I thaught it would rock, Be Fantastic as Many Titles Of EA Games are.
And its A RAP song, Obviously.
There is, well lets see Only 1 soundtrack to this game.
But really i am not very happy with it....
Sometimes i find the game freezes for a second.
The load times aren't that bad maby 30-45 seconds.
But then it all goes down hill.
I would not even give this game a second glance.
I found it boring ....
But they are few and far between.
It starts cool you can create your own fighter or use A Famous Boxer.
The Anouncers Must be preset to only 2 fighter names, And there is a lag between the punch and the comentator commenting on it.

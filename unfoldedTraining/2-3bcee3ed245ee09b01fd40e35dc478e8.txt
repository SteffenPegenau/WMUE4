It's hard not to enjoy Eddy's voice at any stage in his career.
Eddy Arnold had one of the richest, most naturally gorgeous voices that God every put into any singer's throat.
But in all honesty, this isn't a valuable addition to any fan's collection.
Eddy probably put more effort into mowing his lawn or laying grout in his bathroom than he ever put into any one of these songs.
He should have quit while he was ahead.
This is a lame recording put out just for a quick buck.
He was truly one of the greats!
Question: Did they record this album before or after they closed the lid on Eddy's casket?
I'm not kidding, folks.
I can't tell you how bad this album is.
Enough with the hyperbole.
Strictly for geezers cranking up their hearing aids.
Each song is a deliberate snoozer, with no style, passion, or direction.
Okay.
Wow.
Unbelievably bad.

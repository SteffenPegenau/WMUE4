Joshua is an extradinary movie.
He leads by example.
I highly recommend all people to watch this movie.
Anything is possible.
I walk away from this movie feeling that love is still capable of being achieved in this turbulent world.
Joshua brings the whole community of Auburn together.
But it gives us the faith, the hope and the belief that there is another world waiting for us.
It's a movie I recommend for the whole family.
This movie makes the impossible to the possible.
In the end that is what all of us need to do.
Tony Goldwyn does an excellent job in portaying Joshua, Who is to say that Jesus doesn't come down to visit us from time to time to help us with our troubles?
This is not the Second Coming Of Christ.
There are always what if this were true in the world.
I saw this movie many years ago.
I forgot how much I enjoyed it.

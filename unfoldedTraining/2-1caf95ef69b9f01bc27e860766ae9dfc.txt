I wouldn't recommend this product at all.
I've never seen this before, especially for a kid craft.
Ugh!
The pen part is a soft and thin plastic.
This proves to be a very bad combination!
:( She had blue paint in her eyes, mouth, hair, etc.
If you do buy it, please be careful when preparing the pens for your child's use.
They each have a plug in them to preserve the paint, but the plugs are the same color as the rest of the pen and very hard to see or remove.
My daughter received this kit for her birthday.
and was horrified.
My husband inspected another pen and had a hard time removing the plug.
When my daughter squeezed the pen the entire thing exploded in her face!
It's a great idea and comes with lots of color options.
We are artists and work with all sorts of paints.
Awful.
The slight pressure he had placed on the pen part caused the paint to squirt out all over him once he got the plug out.
However, the paint pens are of VERY low quality.

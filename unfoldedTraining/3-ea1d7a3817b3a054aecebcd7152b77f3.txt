Pretty disapointing.
Looks like lots of fun, right?
.
We all have internet connection with our computers, and most of us have CD- roms on our computers.
You have to have a PC running Windows 98, an internet connection and a DVD rom.
There are two versons of the movie(formatted and widescreen) behind the scenes footage, and other interesting stuff.
There were games and other cool features on this two disk set that I couldn't wait to tear into.
I'll know better next time.
But I doubt that all the people who buy this DVD will have computers with DVD players.
The cool games won't run off the DVD player on your TV.
No good.On the other hand, there's still a lot to enjoy on the DVD verson.
And while I have one that does, it's a Mac.
I really haven't looked at everything yet, and while it's worth the price, it doesn't deliver on the interactive games.
I waited for one month in great expectation of the DVD verson of Shrek.
Guess I got burned .

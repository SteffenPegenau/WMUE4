I think they went a little overboard on this one.
They use middle eastern style instruments in a couple of the tracks, which is very cool.
Buy it.
This album, is not as good as SOAD's previous release, Toxicity.
Or steal it.
Its a good cd, dont get me wrong.
Its just not as good as the last.
So if you like soad im sure you will like this cd.
The album has a good number of good songs, yet there are a couple ones that just arnt good and detract to the quality of the cd as a whole.
Then look at this one.
Im not opposed to their views I just think too many in an album detract from the song writing.
If you do not have toxicity yet, buy that first.
Their last album had the perfect amount of political views mixed with other inspirational songs.
Another problem is that this album is chalk full of leftist veiws, way too much.
I would of also liked system of a down go a little more hardcore but oh well.

He has three arrows which will fall out of his quiver.
All in all I love this doll.
I give him a full five stars.
However clever styling will minimize that effect.
I finally received my Legolas and I was immediately blown away.
I suggest you get him many more arrows to fill his quiver.
you will love it.
His clothing is authentic to the movie.
His body is partly a My Scene boy doll body, but the arms hands and legs are better sculpted and shorter than the my scene.
He is simply beautiful.Ive already taken him out to examine him closely.
I must say Mattel put great effort into making him look elvish and ethereal.
I do wish they had given him his knives though.His ears are perfect, they sit against his head well and do not stick out as Orlando Bloom's did.
Buy him!
Buy two!
My only complaint and not a serious one is that if you undo his braids you will realize his hair in front is much longer than the hair in the back.
His bow is beautiful.

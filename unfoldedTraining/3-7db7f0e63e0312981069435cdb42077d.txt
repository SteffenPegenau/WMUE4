Stuff I never knew, but it wasn't even in the main feature.
Tell me about how Makaveli created these masterpieces, not what he thought of Biggie.
Same East vs. West sh_t we been hearin'.
I know that sh_t, its old.
Go buy some DPG albums instead.
There was only 10 basic members to the first Death Row family.
Rent, don't buy it.
Come on, tell me about the early days and how DPG came to be.
That is the reason why I gave it 3 stars.
Barely anything interesting on Makaveli & Snoop*.
Snoop* - there was a side interview in the special features that had Snoop talking about Daz, D.O.C., Above The Law.
No talk about DPG & Outlawz???
Every damn Death Row documentary focuses on the same sh_t.
Tell me how Daz met Kurupt, and how Dre signed all of them.
And here they go again focusing on Suge (boring story heard a million times) and Dre leaving.

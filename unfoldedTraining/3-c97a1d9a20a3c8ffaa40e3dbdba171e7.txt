Well the video is great.
When it starts out for all the recent and updated Halford releases including all the remasters it freaking jams.
Was very excited to see this come out.
Then the show starts and you are like I can't hear anything?
Saw Halford last year with this setlist in Chicago House of Blues.
at all.
Oh its in the 2 channel.
Cool well where is the bass?
This show was a few weeks or so before I saw them in Chicago so I wanted to have this so to relive.
Well that's just great.
I have tried many other bluray music discs just to make sure and well it is only this one.
Lets just go back to vhs.
Great show!
In other words my subwoofer only detects sound if I switch it to 2 channel.
Luckily I have enough tweaks with my reciever to make it sound decent.
So then you turn it up.
Halford is the greatest unfortunately the audio dude for this is not.
Whoever recoreded the 5.1 hd audio needs to find other work immediately.
There is no L.F.E.

The wheels don't ride true.
The suspension design is pretty effecient.
Dual suspension is all together more fun and comfortable, but probably not more effecient.In summary I think I was expecting more for $300.
The Schwinn Delta Sport is over all a good bike.
Here are what I don't like about it.
There is no kickstand.
It comes with bottle mounts but no bottle or cage.
The front shock doesn't have a full grommet cover.
The seat is a little hard.
I liked the Shimano Acera, and products.
The rear gear cassette wobbled a bit.
The front gears have no cover.Here are the things I did like.
I would have liked plastic pedals, (they are metal.)
But it's a pretty good bike.
It wasn't packed well, there was a big chip in the paint.

What can be said that hasn't been already?
This is the most horrific television ever to be aired.
When watching, you will be in television heaven or hell (depending on the scene).
Documentary?
You will care for some of these characters and you'll pity the rest of them.
Comedy?
Suspense?
It's the train wreck you can't look away from.
This show will drag you from one emotional extreme to the other within a moment.
It may not be real, but it has what makes the few good reality shows good and more.
Terror?
Now.
Horror?
See it.
(the term mockumentary doesn't do it justice) All of these things!
Don't wait for the Christmas Episodes, buy them later.

While Umi and Fuu just ran away.
Its more of the "little girl" type.
This anime just doesn't interest me.
I was very dissapointed in it.
If anyone has a problem with it, get over it!
They should have called "The Hikaru Show" Plus that Princess looked like a priss.
I heard around the web about how great this series was, so I decided to try it.
I find Sailor Moon much better.
Everytime the went to chibi form that drove me crazy.
The plot line didn't interest me.
Monkona is very annoying.
Some parts were ok. Everyone says that its better than sailor moon.
Plus the characters got very annoying after awhile.
They seem to give the main parts to Hikaru.
This is just my oppinoin.

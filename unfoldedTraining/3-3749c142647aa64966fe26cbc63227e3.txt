Some of the songs that I like are "Turn Back" and "English Eyes."
The guitar and keyboard playing are tight and satisfying.
This disc from Toto is good and worth a listen.
The CD booklet contains the song lyrics.
The album cover is also pretty interesting.
The album is in a pop rock musical direction.
I really do like Steve Lukather's guitar tone on "English Eyes."
It's got a nice atmosphere to it, and the keyboard playing is sprightly.
The musicianship is proficient, and the songwriting and production are good.
It seems that there's more of an emphasis on the guitar playing on this album, too.
"Turn Back" is a cool tune, also.
It also sports a really cool intro.
There's a total of eight tracks, and I find all of them to be good and listenable.
Turn Back is a pretty good disc from Toto.
There's some energetic material throughout, and the vocals are good.

They're far from just being ordinary and empty.
A little more meat should have been added to them.
All of them are good.
Some of the songs aren't very busy musically.
I don't have any favorite songs.
Worth a listen.
That aside, this is still a listenable and interesting disc.
The vocalist does a pretty good job, also.
The lyrics to "(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang" and "Let's All Make a Bomb" are examples.
It's a nice slice of synth pop.
There's some really cool keyboard work throughout.
There is something about this album that I've always noticed, though.
The lyrics to the songs are also quite interesting.
The production, musicianship, and songwriting are satisfying.
The album is in a synth pop direction.
Penthouse and Pavement is a pretty cool disc from Heaven 17.

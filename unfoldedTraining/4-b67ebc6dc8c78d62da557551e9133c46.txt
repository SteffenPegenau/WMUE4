It's great for finding the nearest gas station or food options available.
The only downside is that sometimes the maps are outdated.
A couple times it has asked me to turn at the next street when I'm on the freeway.
My parents thought it was a godsend when they were visiting.
And as frugal as they are were very interested in getting one of their own.
Now that I know a little more about geocaching, I don't think this is the type of gps we'd need.
But I can always get back on track.
We don't care.
We are so pleased with it for everyday use though.
A good gps will change your life.
We love it!
This gadget though pricey was a great investment.
I like that I can use it as a pedestrian (finding out of the way places when walking) and love that I can hand it to houseguests instead of having to constantly print out mapquests.
I bought it for my fiance because we had dreams of geocaching and take quite a few road trips.
Not quite possible.
It has saved us so much time when traveling.

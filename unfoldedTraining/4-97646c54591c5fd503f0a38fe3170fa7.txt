Well, the ending is ok, i guess.
I loved how that turned out!
But overall, this game gets 4 stars.
It wasn't as scary and high energy as some of them.
This one was one of my favorites.
Enjoy!
I loved the new cell phone idea and that you can take pictures.
I recommend Secret of Shadow Ranch.
It's definitly worth buying.
I won't give anything away, but the whole kidnapping and finding sequence is great!
The story line is good and there are some definite plot twists.
It's got a majorly suspensful ending and it's kind of a new expierence in the Nancy Drew games.
The puzzles are definitly challenging and i noticed that in this one, there are a lot more puzzles than usual.
I happen to be a die hard Nancy Drew fan and I have a lot of their games.
I think this is good more for teenagers, but its good for adults too.

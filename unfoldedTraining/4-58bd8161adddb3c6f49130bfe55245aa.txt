I had to put the kitchen together alone.
I did my research before I bought it and I am very happy I chose this kitchen.
It was not that hard.
It does take a lot of batteries but, the sounds are so realistic.
Not only does our daughter love it but our 4 yr old son does also.
At first I was mad but, then I thought, I'm sure my kids will eventually try to peel the stickers off.
I couldn't put all the stickers on the kitchen.
My hands were hurting when I was finished.
I don't know what was wrong with mine.
My husband got a 24 hour virus on Christmas Eve.
It took about 1 1/2 hours.
Make sure you use a power drill and it is charged.
Our drill wasn't charged enough.
The sticky part wouldn't.
The only bad thing about the kitchen was the stickers.
We bought this kitchen for our 20 month year old daughter for Christmas.
As I peeled each sticker, only the picture would come off.
You have to screw in about 50 screws.

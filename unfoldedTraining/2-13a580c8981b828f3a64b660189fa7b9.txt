But it wasn't, it was what you would expect from a generic cd player.
If the sound was blow me away, amazing.
But trust me, it's not this.
To get to song 160 you have to click the forward button 159 times!
What's that about?
I can't yet point you to the perfect mp3/cd player.
There's no fastforward or rewind in songs!
I also bought new koss headphones for this thing and still, dull sound.
But that wouldn't bother me at all!
I need loud and I need bass.
Searching for an mp3/cd player at low cost, and amazing sound, both volume and levels.
How could you not add that?
I got this player and although it looks very cool indeed, it's still weak.
Very inconvenient.
I was on the prowl.

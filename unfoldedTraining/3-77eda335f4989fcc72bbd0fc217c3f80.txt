A lot of FIGHTS AND PROBLEMS, and I know your mad about that, but that's how it goes!
This was the time when Alice Copper, Black Sabbath, and I do believe that new Group Kiss was just breaking out at that time.
So, went to Wallecks Music City in Lakewood, Calif., and bought the album.
COME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!
P.S.
I'm mean what's your problem about that anyway?
couldn't stand each other!
Video machines back then, don't think they had Bata in 1974, where real expensive.
Not the same, to bad.
It sounded great, and if i'm not mistaken, broadcasted on 95.5 KLOS FM.
The bottom line is this!
Maybe Rick done that because HE seen what was going on in the future!
The guy that was saying something about that Red Cap he was waring, SO WHAT!
Rick and Ion ( Yep, that's His true Born Name! )

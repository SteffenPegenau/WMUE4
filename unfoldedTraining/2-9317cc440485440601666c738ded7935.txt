It's never a good indication of "good" when I can stop a movie umpteen times and do whatever I just thought of because "now seems like a good time."
Minnie Driver?
If you're patient.
Somewhat unbelievable, definitely, but interesting.
Mary Steenburgen?
But not much.
This was quirky and a bit weird.
I guess you can't expect everything to be stellar.
But watch-able.
What a shame.
(Colin Firth?
It was interesting.
"Work with what you've got" I guess was the mantra during this one.
I wouldn't say this was a complete waste of time.
One very sweet 3 seconds and an actual moment warranting genuine laughter.
Please.)
I really expected this to be better.
And it got a little better as it went on.

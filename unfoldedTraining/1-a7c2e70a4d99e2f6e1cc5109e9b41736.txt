I have one light left on this thing.
After the 2nd one broke in the same exact way I knew it was just a poor design.
Just broken hanging off the side.
One that's metal.
Or at least not the cheapest floor lamp out there.
Who want's a frankenlamp?
Garbage light.
I totally got what I paid for.
A temporary fix to lighting my apt.
At least that's firmly attached.
The other 2 are still technically there.
The plastic ring where the arms of the light go into the pole actually split down the side so despite no matter how much glue, epoxy or duck tape you use, it's just not enough.
The pivot points are so poorly designed that should you actually adjust your lights on a semi-regular basis it will break.
My advice?
I am not hard on my stuff.
At least in my experience.
Besides, this is in the dining room.

That line simply sums up all of the Star Trek movies.
However, I liked him besides that he got drunk all the time.
One of my most favorite lines in the movie was said by Cochran: "What are you some kind of astronauts .
When I first watched this movie, I was, "WOW!"
Jonathan Frakes proves himself as both a great director and a great actor.
I expecially liked the scene in which the Enterprise-E enters the fray against the Borg cube.
Bottom line: A CANNOT MISS FOR ST FANS!!!

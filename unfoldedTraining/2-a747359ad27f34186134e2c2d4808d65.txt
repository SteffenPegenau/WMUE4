I also noticed that it took at least half an hour for the machine to get really hot.
Nothing.
The pump just went dead.
I tried to shut off the machine and turn it on and nothing.
Before purchasing the machine I had done a bit of research.
I even took it apart and replaced it.
The coffee that came out was fine, but although it heated the milk, it made little froth.
Of course, I had cleaned the attachment well.
It didn't work.
I'm returning it.
The professional reviews and customer reviews I read placed this machine at the top considering the price tag.
My third time using it, I tried to get froth by heating the milk for over 20 minutes.
I waited about fifteen minutes and turned it on and the pump worked, but now no froth came out at all.
It could be that this particular unit was defective, but I'll try for a more expensive brand.
The machine stopped working.
I used a needle to clean it again.
In fact, it got so hot that if you touched it you would burn.

She was the only one who made real growth.
I'm Glad I bought this in paper back.
I mean [dang], This [stinks]!
All of our other characters were left behind, and Tracy was still as shallow as she was when she was 16.
And the way Tracy met up with Victor was terrible and she looked like the same [girl] she was in Flyy Girl.
They should have a negative rating because 1 star is far too much.
I purchased this book like 6 months ago and still haven't finished it.
Either Omar Tyree is stupid as hell or he expects us to be.
I read Flyy Girl and had very high hopes.
The only characted I appreciated in this novel was Rashida (sp).
Whatever happened to Bruce???
Why is she still making the same bad decisions she made at 16?
I mean gosh, it's supposed to be a sequel.
And the Hollywood thing was freakin far fetched...We're just supposed to believe that Tracy became a millionaire?
And I probably won't.

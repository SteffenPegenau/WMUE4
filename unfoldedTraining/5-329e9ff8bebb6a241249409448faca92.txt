You did what you had to do in this world.
Thanks for the game!
"Why am I here playing this game!?!?!"
I always wondered what the school looked like and the first five minutes seeing it was great!
Then I got bored.
But I gave it five stars...Unfortunately...I couldn't stop playing it and to this day, I still am.
But after I played this game, I felt like disowning myself!
I used to like Harry Potter!
So who ever made this game, I tip my hat to.
I was stupid.
The only good thing about it is the backround.
Every room was the same!
It was like a poor man's house!
That's when I felt like going to school and getting an education.
I asked myself as playing this game.
The question would be soon answered.
"Why?"

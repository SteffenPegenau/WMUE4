She ruined a perfectly good book.
Then the book became so good until near the end where the plot twist took place.
I felt she only cared about herself.
I felt like I was tricked.
At the very beginning I found Samantha annoying but she grew out of it after a few chapters.
It was all business.
Spoiler alert - how could Samantha be Cecily?
I am just really upset because the book was so good and had to be ruined by the plot twist.
It did not make sense.
The book did not make sense after finishing the book.
He was looking all over for her and she continued to trick her.
Samantha never acted like she knew Gabriel.
I will never read another book by this author again.
I did not see it coming.
There were no clues and it was like I was looking at two different people.

An inexpensive addition to your blu ray collection and a very good movie.
Was a $5 promo deal from black friday I believe.
I got this for christmas.
No regrets.
Maybe I'm just getting old lol.
Some pretty bloody scenes and some adult content as well.
I enjoyed this movie.
It's a very violent movie.
Course, most war movies are.
May not be suitable for kids tho.
For some reason I had a hard time understanding what was being said or going on so I had to turn on the subtitles.
I admit it took awhile to get it's hold on me because the beginning was a bit dull.
Even the special features were interesting and the clip about the history of the movie and how it was based on true events.The movie is priced pretty low and it's blu ray so go ahead and pick it up.
But this movie was good.
Was a pretty good movie.

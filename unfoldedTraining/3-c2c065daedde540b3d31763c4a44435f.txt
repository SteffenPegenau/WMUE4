I eagerly wait the release of the rest of the G.I.
Joe"!
Got to love those PSAs!
"Come on, Slaughter, kick his fangs in!"
"And knowing is half the battle!"
Yo Joe!
Finally, we sort of get a glimpse of what Cobra Commander looked like under his hood.
Cobra!
The movie had some great animation, and the voice work was fantastic!
Is that an odd coincedence?
I wished there were more extras, such as a short look behind the scenes.
Joe series.
I find it highly amusing that Burgess Meredith (who voiced Golobulus), also starred in the 1945 live action movie called "The Story of G.I.
The scene from "Arise, Serpenter, Arise", where Cobra Commander cheers on Sargent Slaughter during Slaughter's fight with Serpenter is downright hilliarious!
I felt sorry for the Commander when he was turned into a snake.
An enjoyable movie, with an interesting orgin of Cobra.

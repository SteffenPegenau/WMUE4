Also, it won't e-file if I manually update state med deductions directly in form.
In fed, it never prompts u to enter 1099G forms.
Kept telling me to go to hire a tax advisor.
This can cost u an audit.In state (NJ), it never prompts you to enter medical deductions.
However, it is buggy.
NJ state is 2%, so I would be able to deduct but taxcut never prompts for it.
I bought TaxCut because of all the bad things said now about turbotax.
The state numbers are not the same as fed.
Called Tech Support, explained them problems, but they are clueless.
It just silently uses the federal numbers.
Even worse, on fed, it asks if you have more than 7.5% med expenses, otherwise, don't bother entering.
If u have medical FSA, it cannot itemized on federal, but can be on state.
So I didn't enter any med deductions.
Just silently puts 0 from fed.
:(
However, this is wrong.

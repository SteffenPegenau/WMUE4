It wasn't funny, either.
Despite my hate of it, I *must* defend it on one point; it's NOT meant to mock Christianity all together.
After a half an hours time, I knew that it wasn't worth the hype.
The climax even takes place at the big seinor prom.
I don't think I laughed once.
?
"Saved!"
It's meant to mock Chritians who take thier religion out of hand.
It just got worse and worse, and more like a cheesy, everyday teen comedy.
I noticed that many of the people who have given this a one-star rating all comment on how it makes fun of Christianity, and I want to know; have you ever actually *seen* this movie??
I even went to see it the night it came out in theaters.
I wanted badly to leave, but forced myself to keep watching, thinking it *might* get better.
It looked funny, and was soppoused to be different from most teen-acted comedies.
was the only movie I *really* wanted to see this summer.
The annoying cast of charectors made it all the more worse.

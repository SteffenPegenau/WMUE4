If the DVD is removed and then reinserted, this corrects the problem.
If you are like me, you aren't going to buy a DVD player toplay games with zoom, freeze frame, etc.

On some occasions on DVD, when the movie starts, the audio is undiscernable.

There is a ticking sound while the disc is spinning that can be heard from my listening position 13 feet away.
What I believe most consumersare looking for are a well built machine that delivers a high quality picture and audiophile sound.The Toshiba delivers on sound and picture, but not on manufacturing quality.For [the price range], maybe I shouldn't be so picky, but here are my gripes:1.
The CD sound is better through the RCA outputs than the coaxial cable.
The tray is flimsy, wiggling up and down.
In order to return to a prior track, you have to double click the back arrow, and even then it's hit or miss.

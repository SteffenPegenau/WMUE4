I'm not big on magic.
That's the queerest prestige class I've ever seen in my life.
I would love to have a shocker lizard or pseudodragon.Other people praise this book like it is a godsend.
Or the candle caster?
There weren't a lot of interesting things in there for me to explore.
The new spells aren't that great, either.
I hated this book.
I've never been one for metamagic feats, and that is the majority of the feats in there.
I mean, sure, Dragon Disciple, Acolyte of the Skin, Arcane Trickster, Blade Singer, and Blood Magus (especially blood magus) are good prestige classes , the rest blow!
I personally don't prefer magic users, though I was one for a while because my party didn't have one.
That is probably the reason why I don't like the book.
Oh my, you can cast spells through your sword!
But now my friend, a bard, can cast a lot of spells, so I'm ditching my wizard for a rogue.
The feats suck.
The biggest plus was the familiars.
Big deal!
I mean, a spellsword?

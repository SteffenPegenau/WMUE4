But his research and clear knowledge of what seems like every little detail is incredible.
The reviews for this book are all over the board.
But if Clancy surprises me on that matter, he will truly prove to be a brilliant author.

This has to be the last Jack Ryan book.
The conversations between players such as Judge Moore, Greer, Ritter, Mary Pat and Ed taught me so much.
I am a big Clancy fan and was extremely disappointed with "The Bear and the Dragon."
Clancy's reputation for action and technical information is absorbing.
Yet it seems thoughtful and well laid-out.
My only question is "what's next?"
I think it is all due to what you want in a novel like this.
Yes, this book is quite different from some of Clancy's books.
History buffs--get this book and enjoy.
It seems to me that Clancy has found his voice again.
In reading the book, I felt as if I, for the first time, really knew what the old KGB was like.

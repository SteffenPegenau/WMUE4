I had my previous Krups egg cooker at least 5 years.
Hard boiled eggs are a snap.
Yes, I do know how to cook, but you put the egg in, with the measured water, and you can walk away.
Even my 8 year old uses it over pre-packaged breakfast microwave food.
My kids gave the Oster machine a big "no".
The perfect food with the perfect cooker.
For the money and the time saver, this is your machine!
I am now, happily, here to order my Krups egg express.
The alarm tells you when it is ready.
What a mistake.
When my first Krups finally gave in from so much use, I thought I would upgrade.
The eggs would cook uneven and was next to impossible to get the eggs out, even with a heavy dose of pam.
My kids always request hard boiled eggs for lunches.
I purchased and used the Oster egg cooker.
With 3 little ones and husband, this is used every day.
The egg poacher cooks the eggs perfect everytime.

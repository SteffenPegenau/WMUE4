Very funny dialogue.
This is a really fantastic little flick.
The women are varying degrees of attractive and the nudity is there!
There are several necessities for these to appease fans of this genre, including interesting amusing characters, gore, and a good amount of nudity!
Cheap, but gory and cool effects.
First let me say that I am an aficionado of B-movie horrors.
As an aside the recent 'night of demons' remake FAILS miserably because of the limited nudity; only one of the actresses gets her top off.
The story is simple, solid, and good!
The main actress who plays Sherry is absolutely gorgeous.
Great likable characters.
Spectacular special effects or established stars are not requirements.This movie succeeds on many levels.
Those filmmakers simply dont get it.Anyway this movie is great.
Its amazing that old b-movies get remade now with the nudity gone.
Hope to see more of her in more movies.
There are several funny characters with hilarious dialogues!

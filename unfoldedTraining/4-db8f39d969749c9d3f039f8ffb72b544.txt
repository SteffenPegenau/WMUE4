Pygmy Funk is a strange, but good song.
Throughout the whole cd there are great melodies and many different parts and sounds.This is a good debut album by Spyro Gyra.
All in all, it's a nice cd worth the purchase.
OpusD'Opus is also a great track featuring a tight drums/percussion solo.
This cd conveys a great mixture of sounds and is quite unique 70's Spyro Gyra.
Thank you for taking the time and generosity to read my review.
It is a must for your Spyro Gyra library.
Spyro Gyra is a well-rounded Spyro Gyra record.
For being their debut album, this cd is really quite good.My 3 favorite tracks on this album are 1,2, and 4.
However, some of the end songs can get minorly repetitive.
Shaker Song is their first song and it's great and has an extraordinary melody to it.
It originally appeared back in 1976.
Strange is good, right.
It was their debut album.
The cover art is interesting as well.
It's a classic.

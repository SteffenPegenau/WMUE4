Didn't want to invest in building a fence so the Scarecrow seemed like a good idea.
Found deer hoof prints in the garden a couple nights ago but they hadn't eaten anything - which means the Scarecrow scared them off.
And it works.
My dad put that thin plumbers tape on when we set it up a couple of weeks ago....before screwing the pipes together.
I have had a heck of a time with it leaking.
But I guess the plastic it is made of is not the best quality.
But if it constantly leaks it wastes too much water.
It helped.
I leave it on most of the time because I never know when the deer need a snack.
I have a small vegetable garden that the deer and rabbits love to get into.
The Scarecrow does work.
($$$).
Then my husband had to put more on last night because it was leaking again.
It really is a good idea.
But I had to give it a 3 star because it is really not a good product if you can't get the leaks to stop.

Why should you not be able to just save and load?
That's dumb.
The game falls short of perfect because of one thing!
Why should you have to write a password down?!
Why should you have to go to so much trouble?
THat makes me so mad!
That's rediculous!
ONE THING!
What kind of service is that?
I hope you editors read these reviews.
Because this is so stupid I can't even believe it.
If you do, then you'll know what to watch out for next time.
You shouldn't EVER [...] make a game where you're forced to use passwords.
I'm tellin' ya.
My only problem with this game is it's way of continuing.

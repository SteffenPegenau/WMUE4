EVERY BIT OF THIS GAME IS FUN!!!
that's not including challenge mode, but in challenge mode you can upgrade your weapons an extra 3 times.
GET THIS GAME YOU WON'T REGRET IT UNLESS IF YOU DON'T BUY IT!!!!!
THANK YOU ISONMIAC BUT I REALLY WANT TO THANK TED PRICE FOR MAKING RATCHET AND CLANK THE BEST PLAFORM GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ratchet & Clank 3 still is the best platform game.
!IF THEY MAKE A RATCHET & CLANK 4 IT WOULD TURN THIRD PERSON PS2 GAMES INTO GLASS!!!!!!!!!!
I love the weapons and you can upgrade your weapons 4 times.
I like the vehicles even though going commando has more.
i GOT THE GAME WHEN IT CAME OUT.
I LOVE THE RANGER MISSONS AND BOSS BATTLES!!!!
The multi-player is fun but do what I did and play it online.
MY NAME IS ALEXANDER.
It's rumoured in R&C2 & 3 you must complete the games without taking a hit or dyeing.
!
THE ARENA BATTLES ARE FUN!

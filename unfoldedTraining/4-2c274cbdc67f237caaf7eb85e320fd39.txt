There is a slight "motor running" sound but it isn't distracting for most.
The battery will charge in 5 hours and will play for 3 - 4 hours.
when you need a DVD player or to view pictures on a CD.
Now, I'll get a different brand, "just in case".
The sound in this DVD Player is loud and clear.
If this DVD Player had not malfunctioned 30 days after use, it would get a 5 star rating.
I like things to work for longer than 30 days or 26 movies.
I recommend purchasing the replacement warranty from Target or Amazon for those "just in case" worries.
I turned it off, then on, but still a blue screen.
Twist screens are the way to go so it can be angled just right.
This player is great to hook up to your T.V.
The Problem: While watching a movie, it turned to a blue screen.
"They" said it was a manufacturers defect and using my warranty, I get a full refund including shipping cost.
It also folds flat to hang on the back of the front seat!
I tried the battery instead of the power cord; No go.

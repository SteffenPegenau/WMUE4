I had obtained a UNCUT bootleg copy of this movie some time a go(dont ask!!
People today just dont get it.
What im getting at is this movie holds up better than the mindless and boring (bloodless)horror of today.
I cant wait!!!!!!!!!!
From overseas!!
!
But its a horror movie!!
These days attion spans are short, which means low IQ levels!!
DUE TO A SYSTEM ERROR THIS IS A CORRECTED REVIEW!!
)and it was even better than when i first saw it.
Now its finally comming to DVD.
Even though the effects are dated a little bit, they can still make your girlfriend squrim!!
Yes the story is a little silly (and i mean a little !!!)
Unlike the really fake cgi stuff out there now.
and the acting so-so.
So just sit back, relax and enjoy a shining star of this genre.

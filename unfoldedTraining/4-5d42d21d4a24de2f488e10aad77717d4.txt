And if you're looking for the most "O.A.R."
'Love and Memories' is probably going to be huge.
And I admit, I wasn't thrilled at first.
Like a lot of people, I was worried about how the band's sound will progressed.
But it could be worse.
I mean, seriously people, how has no one written about this yet?
But I got over it.
I think so.
Most of the CD is.
And even though it's not 'O.A.R's sound' its okay.
I played the CD in my car for a week or so, and ya know what?
I don't care who the band is, or what their sound should be, its a damn good CD.
Is it over produced?
It just is.
songs, they are definitely 'Wonderful Day' and 'One Shot'.Also, no one else has mentioned that 'Dakota' is about John Lennon.

The seat SHOULD NOT move with him.
However, the thing that initially bothered me is trully a PROBLEM!
I'll be looking for something else.
The straps are poorly designed.
My son flew forward, the seat pulled with him(!!!)
It's got a lot of good features: large basket, safety bar with tray for baby, cup holder for adult, full recline, adjustable handlebar, lightweight and rather easy to steer, fold and carry.
This is our first stroller since our 9 month old grew out of his carseat/universal carrier.
and his face hit the tray.
The other day, he was in the upright position and someone dropped something in front of us.
It has some great features, but it's not worth the risk to my son.
I didn't see it and stopped short when we hit it.
I got this stroller because for the money I could spend it seemed the best.
They don't tighten enough for my son and he's not a small baby.
Until recently I've been pretty happy with it.
I had the straps as tight as they would go.

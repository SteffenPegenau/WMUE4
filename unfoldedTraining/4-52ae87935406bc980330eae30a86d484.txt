But, it doesnt have that many good tracks on it.
He is better than about 95% of the MC's out now.
And I just dont think it deserves 5 stars.
And since I am from Baltimore I know the fact that no one outside of the city lines knows who he is.
It is a shame.
The album title is Law and Order.
The rest are average.
His words are on point.
If you want to hear a great album check out this man named Bossman straight Outta B-More.
He is the best that I have heard.
The songs that are overaverage are Westside Story, Dreams, Hate It or Love It, How We Do, Put you on the Game, Start from Scratch, and Like Father Like Son.
The whole album is hot, all the beats are fantastic.
Since B-More is in the center of the East coast he has both flavas of the South and the North.
So just check this man out.
It is good, one of my favorite albums.
Most are average, but his flow is overaverage.

But I think she is the basest sort of person, and deserving of far, far more punishment than she gets.
But I cannot stand it.
But if I ever encounter Harriet on the street, there's going to be trouble.
I have now written two reviews based on the main characters; both characters write in journals things which they would never speak.
I don't understand why and how we are supposed to like this character, much less how and why so many people do.
The first time I read this book I ripped it to pieces and had to pay the library.
I did like that girl who wanted to blow up the world.
I despise Harriet.
But I absolutely loathe Harriet the Spy.
It makes me want to throw up, but that's too passive.
No, not the book.
This book is honest and groundbreaking and all that, perhaps.
And, wow, it's great to get this all off my chest.
Harriet.
I love Mary Lou Finney (from "Absolutely Normal Chaos" by Sharon Creech).
This makes me an outcast, perhaps.
The character.

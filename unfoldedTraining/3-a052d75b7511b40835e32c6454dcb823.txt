For example, carrots were originally white, purple and yellow.
Best investment!
Book-useful but not the best.
I bought a food dehydrator to make my own fruit leather and yogurt.
Thanks for the information.
I love my dehydrator.
More importantly, I was expecting recipes for dehydrating.
I was looking for something unique, like say: zucchini pineapple chips, peanutbutter banana leather or apple pie cheddar roll-ups.
I think listing recipes that use dried tomato (devilled eggs)is not a recipe for dehydrating.
I purchased this book so I would understand how to dry particular fruits, vegetables, etc.
I would have appreciated a table of information: storage, prep, drying temp etc.
But, I knew this and its not relevant to dehydrating.
The book does DEEPLY cover historical information about many vegetables and fruits.
Not a recipe using dehydrating ingredients in another recipe.
So if you are looking for recipes this book is weak in this regard.

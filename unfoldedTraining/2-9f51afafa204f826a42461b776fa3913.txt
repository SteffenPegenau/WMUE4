It is fun in spots, terrible in others and borders on boring in the last quarter.
But a lot of people have thoroughly enjoyed poking fun at it.
So forget that.
One does need an enormous suspension of disbelief to accept this movie as serious science fiction.
But as a send up, probably unintentional, it stands alongside "Independence Day."
And the alien, Terl, played by John Travolta is actually an interesting character and a villain you could love to hate.
The story is terrible.
Why not watch it and join the fun?
The alien Psychlos are much more interesting than the heroic human characters.
But, the acting is not so bad.
As many have pointed out, the plot holes are many and huge.
It is certainly not the worst movie ever made.
But the character falls flat in the latter part of the movie.
But I don't regret watching it.
When the story revolves around the duplicitous Psychlos, the movie is actually fun.
I enjoyed the movie.

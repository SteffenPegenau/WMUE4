For whom, for what?
I got this at used CD/Video shop and am not worrying at all because I will get 75% refund when I return this.
The girl looked really wicked/pleasured when she was driving the mower to crush the toy soldiers.
Why did you join this crab, Stan?
In conclusion, this movie seems to have many very critical flaws.
And the boy/girl, our main characters even smiled to this man.
(Was that 2nd grader who made this?)
Even after evil toys(yeah, I mean evil small soldiers) almost destroyed their homes, checks of the evil business man can make the parents smile!
25% is good investment for this good lesson.
I don't know what they had in their minds when it made.
Very very weird.
Do they think he is cool because he got power and money and smart plan to sell that deadly toys to south america as warfare?
Lots of violence(Ok, there was no blood).
Your children will learn money rules the world.
Frankly, this movie was disgusting.

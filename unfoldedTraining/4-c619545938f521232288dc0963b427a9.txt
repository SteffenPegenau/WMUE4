Therefore, not alot of pressure on your knees.
Very sturdy, even if you are over 300 lbs, since you are not standing on the machine it will work for you.
Works on the legs and moves the blood, great for the numb butt.
Low impact, but will make the burn if you work it.
Not what I recommend for traveling, it is alittle heavy.
It does not take up much room for storage, about 2'x 2'space.
Doesn't take up a lot of room to use.
You can sit on the edge of a bed or chair and peddle away in an air conditioned room.
I use it during the summer time when I can't get outside due to the heat.

Great for elderly or someone who is just starting out their routines.
Easy to put together.
Can be used under a desk at work, make a little noise.
But a wonderful work out machine to use while listening to your Ipod !
It takes a moment to get use to the foot and peddle action, you are not pressing down like on a bike but forward.
You do not need to stand up to use the product.

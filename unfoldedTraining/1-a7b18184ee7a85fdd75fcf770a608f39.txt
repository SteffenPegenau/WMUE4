The bad guys have resorted to cliches every other second.
Number 2 rocked almost as much.
Don't even touch Ivy or Bane, they sucked.The plot has gotten pathetic slightly.
This movie is just plain crap.The cast is boring.
Number 3 was pretty good although a step in a different direction.
George Clooney blows as batman.
Yea, it is kinda bad.
Save your money and go buy the other films because this one isn't really worth it.
I really could care less though with such a craptacular cast.
Alicia Silverstone makes a fine Batgirl, but then again batgirl is rather useless.
This movie is an insult to the batman series.
He isn't cold or dark.
Number one was the best.
Robin is pretty good as he was in the last film.
Arnold is the worst mostly because he says cliches that make him out to be an idiot.
He is probably the worst thing in the entire trilogy.

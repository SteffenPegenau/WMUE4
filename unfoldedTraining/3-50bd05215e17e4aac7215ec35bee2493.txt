I've waited years for this.
Marvelous!
Wonderful!
The only two songs I would have loved to have on this set is Weakness In A Man and Poor Old Ugly Gladys Jones, which was a novelty song Waylon did with Country song writer Don Bowman, Bobby Bare, and Willie Nelson (Both songs only available on Bear Family label).
Well, forgive me for being greedy.
The rest of the cds have all his other great songs.
This is a must have.
Nashville Rebel, don't leave the record store without it!
The Johnny Cash box and now Waylon Jennings, WOW!
it doesn't get better than this!
A great and affordable overview of Waylon's career on four discs.
I would have bought it just for the song Green River, a little known ballad by Waylon that is just special.
Maybe Roy Orbison will be next.
Cd #1 has all his great early stuff and is Wunderbar!
Thank you Sony and BMG.
Yes!
Yes!

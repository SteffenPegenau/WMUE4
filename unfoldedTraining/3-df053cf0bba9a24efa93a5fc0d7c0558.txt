"Off World"???
All right...like everyone else says...it fails to be stargate.
Where is the John Sheppard???
Does that word exist in this show???
Yea there is a circle in the ship that allows them to go off world.
Stargate is known for its sense of humor!
WAAAAAAAY over dramatic.
Where are the characters we like.
And I mean characters like them...not actually them.
Wait what?
Anyway, Im gonna stop complaining and keep watching HOPING that it will get better!
The characters could be likable if they didnt back stab each other every other minute.
I have been a HARDCORE FAN since the very beginning of Stargate SG-1 then to Stargate Atlantis!
Where is the Jack O'Neill???
I have faith in Stargate...don't let me down!
And I will admit I was super excited for Universe...but what is this?
Isnt that what Stargate is mainly about???
I love those shows!
Although It would definitely help Universes situation here!

It was fun for about a week.
By the way, I tried Timothy's, Caribou (which had the most flavor), Donut shop, Glorias, Vermont, Tully's and Green Mountain.
I just haven't had a really yummy cup of coffee yet.
That's not really cost effective.
It is cool, no doubt.
It also takes 2 K cups to make fill a regular size coffee mug.
I had to nuke it after about 2 minutes.
ALL TASTELESS pretty much.
I think now that the novelty has worn off, I'll try the Tossimo.
Every cup is weak and tasteless.
My Krups made much better coffee.
I did all the research and read all the reviews and purchased the Keurig B60.
The clean-up is easy, it works fast, I really have fun using it.
Dunkin Donuts is my favorite coffee for goodness sakes!
The coffee wasn't that hot either.
I am bummed because the concept is really cool.
And I like weak coffee!

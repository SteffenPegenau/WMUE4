She is mean to the dead dad.
Before she can even get too know Jesse, she yells at him to get out.
Instead she doesn't really like talking to him.
It was very good.
Her mom get's re-married and she moves to california.
A ghost named Jesse is in her room.
It's about a girl named Sussanah.
I read all the princess diary books.
I found the mediator and decided to give it a try.
Anyways, the first day of school, she sees this ghost who shot herself because her boyfriend broke up with her.
she is a mediator which means that she can talk too and see the dead.
Long story short, she has to battle the ghost.Theres one more thing that I didn't like.
If your dad was dead, you'd want to talk to him right?
Ever since I read "all-american girl" I loved meg cabot.
This is one part I don't like.

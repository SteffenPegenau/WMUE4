If fact, this is my favorite controller because of the bluetooth and turbo.
This is by far the best one I have used.
It has been a really good controller.
The only one I want to try is the Logitech Wireless controller.
The built in Headset jack is ok.
charger, Paul.
But that didn't stop me from using it.
I bought this controller a while ago.
I have used MANY wireless controllers, and they all have messed up.
Like a year or more ago.
Then you can play for hours, charge in 15 min, play for hours.
I am going to buy another because after more than a year of torture, (dropping, throwing, etc.)
it doesn't connect to the receiver anymore.
It does like batteries, but thats why you buy 2650 mah rechargable batteries, with a 15 Min.
It does have interferance which can be annoying.

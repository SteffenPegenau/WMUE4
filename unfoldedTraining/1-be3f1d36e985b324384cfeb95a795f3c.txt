The movie was too busy, the director and storyteller was trying to throw at the audiance too much stuff, too many ideas, it wasn't confusing, it was just so busy that it was not focused at one movie point that moves to the next movie point, like clear crisp chapters...In the end, the movie was too busy and in the end, boring.
The special effects weren't that bad.
I've seen this type of movie a thousand times.
If you wish to see it, wait til the unrated (we all know its going to come out this way) version.
Boring.
Nothing new.
But this movie.
It should have not tainted a game like this one did.
This movie.
But the story, the story tried so hard to be like Resident Evil meets H. P. Lovecraft.
While that would be interesting, this movie, wasn't.
It was just sad.
I think I remember playing the game for like maybe a day, got pretty bored with it.
The acting wasn't bad.
No true experience.

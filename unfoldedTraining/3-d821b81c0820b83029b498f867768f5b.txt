The romantic chemistry is pretty nil.
This is a very so-so movie.
For comedy, there are much better Steve Martin movies.
The comedy.. well, I laughed once or twice.
Or please buy mine.
For drama, Shopgirl is a lot better.
Well, some tongue-in-cheek jabs at life in L.A., which I could appreciate having lived there for a while.
Rent before investing is all I can say.
I wouldn't watch it again.
It's half drama, half fantasy/absurd.
It ends on a positive (and predictable) note.
But mostly, I was waiting for it to end.
All the gushing reviews here had me expecting otherwise and I usually dig Steve Martin, but this movie is tepid at best.
So what does this picture offer?
A seriously lukewarm affair.

Landon and Jamie's love story has such meaning.
This novel is so touching.
The book and the autor deserves that much.
But it was quite predictable.
I would recommend the book and the movie to anyne who likes this type of book.
I decided to watch the movie and it certainly wasn't as great as the novel.
I have got to admit though, the ending was unexpecting.
I know I enjoyed it.
Nicholas Sparks has such a way with his words.
I am a 13 year old girl and I don't usually read those gushy romance novels but after a friend recommended this one to me I couldn't put it down.
Sooo.... knock yourself out.
phh, who wouldn't be sad at that part.
I won't spoil it for you but it's pretty sweet and sappy.
Mandy Moore and Shane West could have done a better acting job.
It did break my heart when when Jamie told Landon she was dying.

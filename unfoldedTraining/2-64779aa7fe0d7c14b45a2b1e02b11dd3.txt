call me an idiot but i dont know.
But these songs are classics.
did you see the commercial for this.
we heard them already.
I can see remixing unreleased songs to give it that feeling that 2pac is still with us.
RIP Tupac Amaru Shakur
okay... 2pac is a legend.
anyways dont support death row just because they want money.
The only reason i gave this 2 stars is because it is 2pac and he is great.
there classics.
one question....
these are remixes of his legendary songs.
im 99.9 % sure that they did that to be funny but that .1% of me says somethin cause does everyone still look the same after 7 years.
This is just something thrown together for a quick doller.
Get the Resurrection Soundtrack coming soon it looks good.
if your a real 2pac fan go get his other cds like all eyes on me, this is for my nigggas, hell even get better days.
why would you remix these songs?
WHY?!!!

Installation is not hard if you have any aptitude for wiring.
I wish they sold the remote handheld unit separately with a wall mount kit.
I have three remotes on three fans.
I have installed this unit with Hampton Bay and Hunter fans.
It is the fan where I did not change the factory default remote code setting.
Can be a snug fit in the fan housing.
You'll pay through the nose for one -- $6!
I found better deals on ebay, less that $1 per battery for qty 5, though it took two weeks for them to arrive (shipped from Hongkong).4.
The 12v battery is an "A23" type and available at any chain drug store.
If I change the setting to some other channel the problem will probably go away.3.
Most likely there is some other wireless device nearby that is interfering (I live in a condo).
I too have noticed one of my fans turning on randomly!
I'd put one by each entry door if I could.

Tie wraps are handy to keep the wiring under control.2.

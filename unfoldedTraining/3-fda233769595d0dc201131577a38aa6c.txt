I bought it last year, and I still have yet to beat it!
Ever since 8.. everything has gone down the drain, even though I liked Kingdom Hearts and FF9.
I will admit that, but the storyline is just bad.
I know the ending because I just went on KaZaA and downloaded it.
I gave it 3 stars, because of it's pretty lights ^_^;;
I just could not finish the game.
But why Squaresoft?
If you were to make a sequel to a FF game, it should have been 7.
Okay, the graphics are great.
Well, to me anyway.
I never liked FFX in the first place, it was one of those games in which I could play it for 10 minutes, get bored of it, stop, then come back later and play another 10 minutes.
I absolutly love Final Fantasy and all.
I'm sorry, but unless you just like pretty light shows and [weak] voice overs, then you will not like this game, or you might.
What do I know?
But the question is.. why make a sequel!?
The ending was okay, from what I saw.
Okay.

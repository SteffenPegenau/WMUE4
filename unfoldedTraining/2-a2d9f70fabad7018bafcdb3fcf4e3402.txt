You're Nothing Without Me and the medley with Catherine Hickland, Andrea McArdle and Alice Ripley are the best cuts.Some of the overwrought renditions are tough to listen to more than once.
There is nothing really engrossing on the album.
Anything Goes is done as a torch song.
If hetook everything down two or three notches, he might come up with a good album.
He strains for drama on almost every cut.
This album's concept is really a great idea.
There's Always One You Can't Forget is so forced and overly dramatic.
The young man has a nice voice; but for the most part everything is overdone.
The Impossible Dream is a dynamic song, but here it is cheesy in his interpretation.
If one is a torch singer he/she might be able to carry it off.
Some of it works; most of it doesn't!His version of Climb Every Mountain is pure corn.
The arrangements are too busy.
The rest of the tunes are merely OK.
Too bad it is not very well done.
The voice is sure there.

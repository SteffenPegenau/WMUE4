And at her age, it is a possibility.
Celia gives the song new meaning, however, by telling us that she will live forever through her music.
The band is tight and well-directed with a clear high-fidelity sound.
I admit it.
In more than one way she is telling us goodbye with this album.
Her voice has the subtlety of a sledgehammer.
The album notes provide the lyrics.
Her voice is like a car with one speed--full speed straight ahead.
This album is mostly pure salsa.
The title comes from her remake of the old disco hit, "I Will Survive."
But she recently said in an interview, "May it be God who retires me."
This is a poignant, moving message.
Total playing time 51 minutes.
It is good for dancing and parties.
My favorite song of the album is "If By Chance I Don't Return (to Cuba)."
I really didn't want to hear this song again.
So, if her health holds up, we will have more recordings from Celia Cruz.
I have never been a big fan of Celia Cruz.

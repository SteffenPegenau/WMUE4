You run around being some fat blob of monkey trying to get "Golden Bananas" that are a obvious ripoff of Banjo-Kazooie and Tooie.
As you probably know, Nintendo depends on their Mario, Luigi, Yoshi and all the other stupid characters.
Nintendo people are obviously on drugs when they make video games.
Now to the game, it's DUMB.
Just signals they're out of ideas.
Those are the only N64 and Gamecube platformers.
Oh, let's say some weird little thing steals this other monkey!
In Yoshi's Story, play a few minutes and you'll obviously know that it was marketed to 5-year-olds.
*rolls eyes* It will revolutionize bad gaming.LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY
Here's a monkey.
This has gotten rave reviews from just about anybody that has played it and I have no friggin idea why.
It's just dumb and so is Nintendo.
Oh , yeah.
Nintendo Revolution?
There's not one aspect of it that's fun.
That's how the game was created.Nintendo games are creative, but sometimes overly so.

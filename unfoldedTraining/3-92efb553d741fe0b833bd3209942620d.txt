There is no point in dusting my apartment more than once every few weeks because 3 days later the dust settles again.
Lately, I have been leaving it on med.
As far as the quiet...not so much.
I began to notice within the first week or so I could breathe better when I woke up.
It makes watching tv or reading distracting.
I cannot compare it to other purifiers, but when it is on high it is loud.
I started using when I would go to bed.
The dust has more recently started to affect my allergies, which I did not seem to have problem with until a few years ago.
It is very dusty here...all the time.
I have it in the bedroom and I flip it on in the afternoon and by the evening the air should should theoretically be cleaner.
So, as far as I can tell, it does help clear the air.
I thought a product like this air purifier would help.
all day.
However, on it's low setting it is pretty quiet.
I live in Chicago.

The controls of the game are pretty simple and easy to handle.
Overall I think this game is a classic, and is fun to play.
Except the buzzing of the flies that frogger can eat.
It looks kind of messed up because he is made of polygons.
The only thing that looks weird is when you look at the front of Frogger's face.
Everything in the game is colorful.
That is a little bit annoying.
That is why you want to eat them as fast as you can.
The only thing different about it is the graphics, the sound, and it has more levels.
The sound is pretty good as well.
Frogger has the exact same gameplay as the original.
Its all on the arrow keys.
I recommend it.
It is basically an updated version of the original.
The graphics are pretty good.

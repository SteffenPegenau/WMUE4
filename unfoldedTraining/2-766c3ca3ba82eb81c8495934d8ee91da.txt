what a rip off!
I was really sad because it was so beautiful.
It just felt chinsy and fragile.
I expected more, this watch retails at $250!!
Let's face it, this watch was only made for looks.
Its so cute and stylish.
But I didn't want to pay $80 for a super small crappy watch that doesn't fit.
So I absolutely adore the way this watch looks.
I love you Gwen, but make better watches!
It was very cheaply made and poor quality.
But my mind changed when I got it in the mail.
The band was super short and it would only fit on the last ridge.
I don't even have a big wrist, between 6 & 3/4 inches and 7 inches.
I returned it because it was tight and uncomfortable.
I couldn't imagine this watch could stand through much.

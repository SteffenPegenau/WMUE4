Don't know if it's the charger or the battery.
It was fun to use with my son on his pinewood derby car.
Worked OK, but did have the annoying battery life and shut-off/restart problems others write about.
I was still happy with it until I pulled it out to use it this year.
So, I tried to recharge the battery.
Still nothing.
Looks like I could use that battery for mine, if needed.
But, I've read so many bad reviews on this site that I think I'll pass.
For now, I don't have a project that requires this.
Bought at Home Depot on 10-17-06 for $69.99 + Tax.
So, it's dead after 3 years with very little use in the past 12 months.
I was considering the Model 8000 as a replacement, since it's the 10.8 V unit.
May go with a corded one the next time.
Found other uses, too, but a corded one would have worked fine.
I turned the unit to on, but nothing happened.

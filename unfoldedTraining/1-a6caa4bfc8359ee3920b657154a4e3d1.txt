They wanted to show how hardcore their game is?
How about 24 3/4?
I'm tired of garbage that floods the stores.
This is fun?
If you want $50 for a game, why not make sure it's playable?
Why not 24?
It is the CHEAPEST game of all time.
I'd like to ask the morons who made and play-tested this sh**, what were they thinking.
7777?
At 50% into the game, I got to a mission I just can't beat, no matter what I do.
It would've been, if it wasn't so unplayable.
It just can't be done, unless you have time and patience to retry the same stupid sh** over and over again, for hours, where the slightest misstep will have you back to where you started.
When you start playing this game, you may have the urge to proclaim it one of the greatest games of all time.
Not so fast.
Another annoying mission has you collecting 17 items.
Why 17?
Then why they have characters with stupid donkey ears, if this is such a hardcore game?
7 million?

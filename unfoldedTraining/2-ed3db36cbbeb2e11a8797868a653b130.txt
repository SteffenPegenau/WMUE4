returning it-- it's still within 30 days since i purchased it.
ok, i thought, maybe i forgot to check that the ring was in place or didn't close it tightly enough.
then one morning i got up and found it sitting in a puddle of water.
then i made sure i closed it tightly but not too tightly.
easy to clean.
i loved it.
worked great for 2 weeks.
so now i'm back on the market for a functional humidifier.
i read all the reviews and figured i can be careful that the plastic seal is in place.
2 hours late it was sitting on a lake.
i checked the plastic seal.
i'm done.
each night i checked to make sure it wasn't curled up.
i closed it reasonably tightly, made sure there was no dripping coming out before connecting it to the base.
humidified the air silently.
it shouldn't be som damn difficult.
and i was.
the next night i set it up a couple of hours before going to bed.

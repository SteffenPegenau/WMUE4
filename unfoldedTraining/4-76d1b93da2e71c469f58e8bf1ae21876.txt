Their town just opened a new Landry mat.
But all they did was ruin the whole store.
I have read better.
They lie and steal.
Their name is the Herdmans.
This book is about a family that is very bad and very sneaky.
They might steel all the food and ruin the whole play.
No one in town likes them.
But, I liked it.
They hoped that the Herdmans don't come.
What will they do next?This book was pretty good it is not the best book in the world.
Because is they do the will probably just ruin it.
But shire enough, they came.
And no one in town wants to be with them.
Because you never now what they will do to you.
There school is planning to have a play with a brunch at the end of it, but they are worried about the Herdmans.
And now there is a mad cat running all over the town.
And they came to wash their cat in the mashings.

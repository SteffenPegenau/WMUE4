It grated on my nerves like fingernails against a chalkboard.
It's BAD.I thought it a kind of cheap water downed imitation of the movie Poltergeist, which was an awesome movie.I'm just giving you my honest opinion.
Where was the suspese?
AT WHAT POINT WAS IT SCAREY????
It even has a "Winner Audience Award Independent Film Festival of Boston".I though the entire movie sucked.

They too were whiney and got on my last nerve.
Constantly whiney whiney whiney.
B O R I N G !!!!!!!!!!!!!BAD!!!!!!!!!

A security system.
Then there was her run-of-the-mill BORING BORING huge Land Rover.
There was nothing particularly unusual about them, one can even get them as toys!
A sop to the foolish masses who are interested in accursed immoral *monster trucks*!
I mean, come on!
Pfagh!
But her high-tech binoculars and her high-tech piton pistol were NOT SHOWN.
I can identify the *gunsmith* already.
There were only things like her .45-caliber pistols.
Gloves, boots, *clothing*?
A gas mask.
I read this book and kept expecting to see diagrams and descriptions of things that nobody else but the Countess could possibly have had, some of the unusually high-tech equipment that she used in the film, the highly specialized things reminiscent of Batman.
Why would anyone be particularly interested in them?
A stupid, unrealistic robot.
Gas masks are not unusual.
What is interesting or unusual about a security system?
I have no interest in what clothing the Countess chooses to wear.

To be straight to the point.
Makes no sense at all.
Really?
The basketball game everyone raves about has one team of 7 foot guys against a team of 5 foot guys.
I remember when this movie came out.
When they get flubber put on their shoes they jump as high as the ceiling and everyone just basically thinks they got better at half time.
We were 12.
All my friends, including me, thought it was great.
You would probably not find a 12 year old today who would like it.
Maybe a 5 or 6 year old would like it.
I can't believe that America was so naive in the 60"s to have actually found this funny.
If you remember it fondly, keep your memories intact and don't watch this.
I took it out recently in the right frame of mind to relive my youth and great memories.
Everything about it is so over the top.
The movie is awful.
You will be disappointed.
Terrible.
I am warning you.

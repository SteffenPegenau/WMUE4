I am using this for home, not a business.
I had read all the reviews but hadn't figured that out.
It is very loud.
Since this thing is so cheap, $50 its probably worth it.
Just putting in an envelope makes the machine sound like its struggling.
I just tried to shred a credit card and I was sure it was jamming, but it did go through.
Its OK, but it is much more of a light duty shredder than I realized.
Its rated at 8 sheets, but almost struggles with 2 sheets, 3 pretty much makes me think I will need to disasemble it.
Hope this info helps someone.
I purchased this shredder a couple of weeks ago.
PS.
I finally burned out my last shredder of 12 years, it had cost quite a bit more at that time (around $100) but it was quiet and could easily take 6 sheets.
In the future I will purchase shredders in local stores.
Sort of wish I bought a better one now, but its to much of a hassle to send it back.
Have been using it for a week now.
I am writing this as informational only.

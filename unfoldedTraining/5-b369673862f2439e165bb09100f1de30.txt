Sound GREAT!
Even at top volume the speakers hold the sound true and rich.
I'd been using the TV sleep timer and have found I sleep better listening to some decent music.Overall a great little machine.
Easy to use.
The power brick is normal size.
Hard edges but really just an annoyance.
Room filling.
It's not.
And that was my only fault with this system.
The sound is really, really HUGE for it's size.
Amazing for it's size.
Yes you have to be in sight view to use the remote.
The "feel" of the remote should be easy and smooth.
How do you review something that's as near perfect as possible.
They should have looked at Apples remote.Hefty for it's size.
iPod alarm works perfectly so it can double as an alarm clock as long as you're not an extra sleep button hitter.I love the sleep timer.

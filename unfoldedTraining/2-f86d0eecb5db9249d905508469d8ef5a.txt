There are many more flaws than even Geoff (another reviewer) points out in his review.
this movie is only very loosely based on the book.
There's almost zero continuity in the film.
The dialogue is terrible.
Gambon lacks these qualities entirely.
I think Michael Gambon, while a fine actor, is horribly miscast as Dumbledore.
Where's his mouth twiching when he's amused and trying not to show it?
I bought the DVD because I'm a Harry Potter fanatic and must have all the movies, but I am deeply disappointed.
The second was very good.
Where's his twinkling eyes?
.
I get irritated just by watching it.
I agree with Geoff .
Beginning with Azkaban, the movies have gone downhill.
I thought the first movie was brilliant in every way.
Albus Dumbledore, as we know him in the books, has an almost child-like sense of humor and wonder.
This movie is painful to watch.

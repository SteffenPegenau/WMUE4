A true genius with STYLE!
And it shows in his music.
A Prince album you can get into!
This ain't Church, it's Showbiz!
We missed you!
Take BLACK SWEAT, it's cool sexy funk.
Guess we have Tamara to thank, huh?
Finally!
Not the rambling acid-jazz joints or the self-indulgent preachy gospel sermons he's been turning out past several years.
Its refreshing to see the Artist having SOo much fun again!
I must admit I've been a little jaded and cynical from his less than sterling recent efforts but WHAT A COMEBACK!
I'm glad he's finally come to his senses.
How many of you remember way back in '85 performing live on stage in Syracuse, when he turned his back to the audience and looked up to the heavens and said: "But they dig it when i'm BAD...!"
Yes your purple highness, we loyal subjects LOVE it when you're bad!
In any case, WELCOME BACK PRINCE!
Quintessential Prince.

It left me thoroughly confused.
ran out of ideas and had to end the book quickly.
I still dunno if he is my favorite.
character in all of the books I have read that doesn't force the female character into doing something she doesn't want to.
Hee Hee.
Grrr.
Other than that little detail, I really enjoyed everything execpt the end.
The thing about Ashton is that he is the only male K.E.W.
In fact, he tells her that a simple "no" will do.
Ruark from "Shanna" was pretty cool.
I don't understand it all.
I thought this book wasn't bad, but I felt like I was being rushed at the end, like K.E.W.
But, compared to "Shanna" and "A Rose in Winter" it didn't stand a chance.~Olivia~
The writing, as usual, was surperb, and the love scenes were great.
Yes, I was serious, very serious.
:) Anywho, all in all, it wasn't such a bad book.
If anyone GETS this book and wants to enlighten me, let me know.

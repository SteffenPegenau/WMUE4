the hotel lies for itself....... (of course).
a family moves into a haunted hotel!
all in all, i wasn't completely satisfied with the plot.
but it's suspenceful, lovely details, fast-paced.
for a man who likes to create plot, this wasn't that great.
there are a lot of details and happenings here.
the otel tries to posess.
there's a mother too.
it's actually hard to tell more.
cool happenings, yes.
the hotel lives.
but i would say this is more a playful story than a plot-driven.
but exactly what/why......?
there was actually quite a lot of unclearity, that's why i've never seen the acclaimed greatness.
the boy has terrible visions and some telepathic skills.
the man is a recovering alcoholic, supposed to take care of the hotel for the winter (it's closed to public).
i didn't get the facts straight.
details, yes.

With Easter Eggs, a Task List, and special celebrations you are just plain awed.
The controls make it easy to feel like the player.
There is also a gamebreaker.
If i were you, I would buy it, NOW!
There are also many more moves by the goalies.
The fighting is real too, with three different types of punches.
There is also an International Game Mode.
Plus you can manually deke!
NHL 2003 is by far EA Sport's best new game.
I also like the feature that you can choose your team's uniform.
As my mom was watching play she was awed by its amazing graphics, as I am.
I love the Create A Player option.
If you fill up your meter and press Z, the play slows down to make you feel captured in the moment.
To add on to what I have already said the NHL Cards option is so neat.
You have a choise of an old, alternate, or home/away uniforms for most teams.
Amazing dekes make your jaw drop.

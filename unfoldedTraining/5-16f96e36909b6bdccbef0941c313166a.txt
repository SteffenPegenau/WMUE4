.
It was a ride on an emotional rollercoaster until the very end.
You want to reach out and touch Jeremy, mend his heart.
I'm telling you .
Sympathy for his sister, Mandy.
This book made me laugh, cry, and scream.
.
Cry out to Philly; tell him that he can have a future.
You felt hatred towards his father.
Jim, the teen from a broken home was a lovable and amazingly developed character.
This book was one of the best I have ever read.
He had amazing relationships with his friends and sister.
I believe Daniel Grey Marshall is an AWESOME writer, and can not wait until he finishes his second book.
this book is worth every page.
It makes you cry for all the people who have to go through what they did.
And hold Jim.
It makes you want to heal the world.
Love for Leslie.

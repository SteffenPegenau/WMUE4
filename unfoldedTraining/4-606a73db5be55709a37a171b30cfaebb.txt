He went from from getting reds in class to greens for an entire week.
The only thing I can figure is his body built up a tolerance to it.
Then he slowly started dropping back to yellows in class to reds again.
I hope this helps.
What a true pleasure he was.
I tried mindcare jr and WOW.
I'm going to try and find more products that work for him and try alternating them.
I refuse to put him on prescription meds.
My 6 year old son has adhd.
Every child is different perhaps with other children the affects will last longer.
The change in him was immediate.
He was sweet, agreeable, told me loved me, was always in a great mood.
What happened???
I saw a side to my child I didn't no existed.
He started getting frustrated easily and moody again.

I mean you can make out people's face in the orchestra.
Anyway this is the best Fantasia.
The original audio stems have been long lost.
This is the perfect Fantasia DVD.
And no that is not Deems Taylor voice.
If you have a two input televion, and the old and new release, have them both at the same spot paused.
Then go htrough the input and make a comparison.
What a difference.
The credits were added later (Its so obvious and the people walking off stage must have been taken from the intermission scene.)
I;'m very glad I did not have to wait until I had kids before they released this.
This is excellent.
It faded right out after Ave Maria.
I mean the sound is excellent, the picture is superb.
I know some poeple did not like it going straight back to the menu after the last frame of Ave Maria.
Thats how the film ended.

Being a very crappy golfer myself, the few times I have ventured on a golf course, I was met with derision and contempt by my fellow golfers.
I thought Johnny and the boys were too nice to them!
They're all like Ted Knight's character from Caddyshack.
Go Jackass!
My favorite stunt is the golf course airhorn.
I slice terribly, usually into other fairways, pissing off the other golfers.
Screw them!
Ack!
The rest of the film is great, too, but I adore the golf course scene.
Could watch that every day for the rest of my life (and beyond).
It's just a 90 minute version of the TV show, and it's brilliant.
No effort is made to connect the stunts with some lame story, and I think that's the best way to make a film like this.
It's hilarious.
I pride myself on being a cinephile, yet, despite that, I love this film.
Golfers are such pricks!
It's so much fun annoying golfers.
Can you imagine if they tried to tie in a love story or something lame like that?

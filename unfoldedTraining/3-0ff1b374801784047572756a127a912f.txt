I hope for better things you Eric, before you hang up your Strat!
I know Eric's still got the ability.
Unfortunately, One More Car/Rider doesn't have what Eric does best, and that's play guitar.
Most of these songs don't have keyboards on the studio tracks.
It's not the Eric we love.The keyboard playing makes me want to gag.
Where's the fire?
Eric, I love ya.
None are great.
Key To The Highway is pretty good.
Listen to the Cream reunion CD which is done about 8 years later.
Where's the passion?
The last song is "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" - on the same CD as "Cocaine", lol - and this kinda sums up this performance.
The result is I feel like I'm listening to a lounge act trying to do Clapton, and it's bad.
It smokes by comparison.I'll keep this CD set in my collection, but sadly it probably won't get much play.
Heck, I own every audio CD you've made.
There's a couple others that are pretty good.

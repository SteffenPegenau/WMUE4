!I have always been a Kerry Livgren fan, given that I absolutely LOVE Kansas from their very first album all the way up through Monolith.
Oh My God!!!
Oh My God!!
!Pleeeeeeeeeease buy this CD.
Oh My God!!!
It is amazing.
Oh My God!!!
This album, is part fantastic prog and part "good old fashioned rock 'n roll."
And the final track on disc 1, "Theophany," fits quite easily into the top 10 prog epics ever, and at the very least, the top 50 songs of all time.Kerry, how do you do it!?
Oh My God!!!

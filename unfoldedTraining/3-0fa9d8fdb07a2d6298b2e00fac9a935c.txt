Well, this album was a trip.
I adore "Its late."
Freddie!
R.I.P.
:( grrrrr....
I hate people who think they know the music of Queen just because they have heard these dreadfully overused songs.
I also loved "All dead, All dead" though it did sound alot like the Beatles.The only thing i skip on this album is We will rock you and We are the champions because they are way overused, which unfortunatly ruins two very nice songs.
!
I really suggest you buy this album beacuse its a nice mix of songs and it does have a certain aura.
I really liked it quite alot, but it was a little like slogging through mud at some parts.
I suppose I like "Spread you Wings", but i really am not a fan of "get down make love."
It makes me really happy to hear that song.
I will love Queen forever.
My favorite was "who needs you".
I love you!
I wish it had more of a tune because the lyrics are raunchy and fun.

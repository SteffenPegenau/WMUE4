Radiohead have set themselves apart from the rest of the music industry by being honest and taking chances.
Warning to all "Rock" fans: This is not even close to a rock record.
This is the future of music.
Groundbreaking is one word that comes to mind.
Right off the bat, the first track 'Everything in It's Right Place' is spooky, mysterious, and beautiful all at the same time.
They pull this feat off by layering sounds together to make music.
I say yes.
Layering sounds together that make songs?
Also, the first three tracks contain NO guitar.
In fact, its the furthest thing from rock.
They have defined for me what is smart music.
Pick it up and see what we are in store for in the future.
It is just flat out good music.
We, as music listeners, will look back ten years from now at this record and say "Wow".
Isn't that what music is anyway?
The future is now, and the future is Radiohead.

I was impressed with Amazon's pricing and value.
Amazon has this great price checking app for smart phones that is a must for price shopping.
The soft grip handle is much nicer than I expected.
The pans are much lighter and less quality.
So I went to the wal to purchase, but the quality wasn't there that I expected.
Well made with heavy bottom, thinner pans burn too quickly.
Thanks again Amazon, you hit it out of the park again!
So I went to k*hl's and found this pan.
I scanned the pans packaging bar code and instantly had a hit for the same pan @ 54% less than the *OHL's department store.
Free shipping and a great product.
Heats evenly and higher quality than the T-Fal Durabase that it replaced.
Nice pan but wasn't sure that I was paying too much.
T-Fal from the wal is a lower quality for consumer use, a throw away pan in my opinion.
I ruined one of my saute pans and was in need of another.

Great product and awesome price.

She was talking about a dog or something.
The way they loved eachother.
I even found myself scanning pages to see which ones I could skip without missing to much information.
Its just not realistic.
I bought this book because of all the 5 star reviews and I regret it.
I really didnt even understand when the two fell in love.
I honestly dont think a real modern day person speaks with that much slang.
Tessa kept calling Galahad "BIG GUY".
This was my first book from this author, but I dont think I will try her again.
I am not into the magic stuff.
The writer was kind of pushing it.
That really bothered me.
I really find this book kind of bad.
I give this book a 2 just because I think that when she had to leave him in the end was kind of touching.
I also found Tessa's language to be kind of over the top.
It was like as soon as I was starting to feel the emotion of the character she said these words and I felt like she wasnt talking about the love of her life.

I know there is the x5l with a larger battery, but the player is huge and heavier.
As expected, video eats away at the battery, but without video the charge was out by the end of the day.
Apple has the right idea with just a picture of the album while playing.
This is a great player.
The little things like the cheesey pictures and battery life forced me to return it.
You can add your songs on as if it were a hard drive.
The only downsides are the battery life and cheesey interface.
The video on it definately exceeded my expectations.
If you aren't anal then I definately suggest this over any player.
Where it lists the artist there is a stupid looking face next to it and the same type thing for album and title.
There are also pictures of folders that just look dumb.
The interface is a bit cartoony.
As much as I hate to say it.
It is nowhere near what it is rated (14hrs).
Sound is great.
As much as people say they won't use it, I found it a great feature.

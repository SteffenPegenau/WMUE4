plus I don't like the smell of the products.
I personally don't mind my frizzy curls.
Too much on the goopy side, and too much fragrance for me.
Yes, No Poo is not for oily hair.
The stylist washed my hair w/No Poo today even tho I told her it would be too heavy and sure enough, way too heavy.
I have Boticelli plus wavy curls, plus oily.
Sshe also used Angel and some other leave in thing.
PI don't like the way it feels -- like conditioner needing to be rinsed out.
The Curly Girl book tells us that too.
I like hair that doesn't look wet, and curls that don't look man-made.
I noticed some folks are talking about Low-Poo too.
Use Low-Poo.
I get compliments on my hair all the time, when I don't use product in it, and when I don't use Deva Curl.
I prefer fragrance free.
I love the cutting method, not the products.

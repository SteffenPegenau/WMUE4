By the way, I've never seen Bill Murray in anything that wasn't great.
Just beautiful.
Very simple story, very lovely.
Great soundtrack (I bought that, too), there isn't much of a plot, doesn't need one.
Funny, touching, sweet, profound in a perfect way.
Bill Murray in the role of a slightly tired and jaded actor is beautiful.
Beautifully shot, beautifully paced.
This movie is a delight.
The two Japanese ladies sitting behind them keep laughing, it is just great.
I've heard he's "difficult" to work with, but is that a bad thing?
).
Each scene is fun to watch in itself, little vignettes (did I spell that right?
Scarlett Johannsen is superb, the actor who plays her husband is a perfect young husband and the girl who plays the dumb action movie actress is a hoot.
Made me want to visit Tokyo.
The scene at the hospital when Bill Murray is talking to an elderly Japanese man seems completely unrehearsed, natural and it worth watching the movie only for that.
He does great work.

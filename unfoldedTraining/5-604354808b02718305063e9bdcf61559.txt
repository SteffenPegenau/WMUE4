This might be on my top 5 best books Iv'e ever read.
But the thing that she didn't know that all the intersting things would happen that summer.
This book was very funny at times and this book had drama and fighting.
This book I thought was much better then "Walk Two Moons".
Some of the things that are intersting are that her cousin Carl Ray (boring cousin) comes down to stay at their house.
And her friend Beth Ann thats crazy over boys.
This had much more action than Walk Two Moons.
But at their suprise Carl Ray was hiding something and Mary Lou has to figure out.
She got carried away, that she wrote 6 journals.
I would reccommend this book to anyone.
She has a very fun adventure when she goes there.

It was a great book!!
It had most of all genres.
This is about a girl named Mary Lou Finney that has to keep and record a journal over the summer.
Then she goes over to Carl Ray's house in West Virginia which doesn't have electricity or plumbing.

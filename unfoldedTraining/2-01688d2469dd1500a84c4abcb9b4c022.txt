They didn't look pretty to me.
:/ I don't know I was looking for maybe a collection of colors that would go great for certain eyes and skin types and different looks with those colors.
What color are you using on the woman's skin??
The colors were bland and the skin very pale.
Larger than I was expecting so I was excited expecting to see lots of nice pictures and details.
In a way I did get that.
There were pictures of women that looked plain.
Just a covering of paleness on the skin.
Even with the make up.
How much is it??
I received the book and it was large.
Also it told you obvious things like using concealer and lipgloss and mascara erm...der.
Honestly a girl's magazine is better and will tell you more than this book.
Also it doesn't name anything specific.
Like what kind of concealer??
Add lipgloss nicely done hair and that's basically this book picture for picture.
However I found a lot of the pictures to be kind of dull and chalky.

It shows how a teenage boy survives in the wilderness with a psychologist.
He gets knocked out.
This book is very good because it is very exciting.
In The River Brian goes back to the wilderness to teach Derek (psychologist) how to survive in the wilderness.
At this point Brian is very scared because he doesn't want Derek to die.
Even though he told Derek that he wouldn't let him die he still felt worried.
One quote that Brian told Derek is, " I won't let you die."
The first two books are Hatchet and Brian's Winter.
I recommend this book to kids that are twelve and up.
One of my favorite quotes that Brian had said was " I can't give up".
Things go well until a lighting bolt hits Derek.
This is a good quote because Brian knows he can save Derek.
This book is an adventure book.
Derek is feeling that he can't save Derek.
Before you read The River you should read the first two books.

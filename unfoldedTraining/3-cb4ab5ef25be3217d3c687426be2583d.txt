Dave Matthews Band has a totally different creative beat and much more talented musicians (Carter!
Many of the songs sound the same, with the same guitar lick and reggae beat.
Thanks.
Also the way each song is way too reminscent of every other song.
is not a good band, they are talented musicians, BUT they need to tighten up their playing and add some variety to their music.
and Dave Matthews are two different things.
come on, his beats are crazily unmatched), sorry O.A.R.
To compare them is ridicolous.
If I could do it again, I would've saved my money and just purchased the live album, "Any Day Now" because, although again sloppy, has more songs.
I don't care what anybody else says, each song reminds me of the last besides "Toy Store," which is in a league of sloppy playing and bad lyrics of its own.
Anyways, "The Wanderer" is an alright album.
Look, I am not saying O.A.R.
Also, Dave's songwriting does seem to repeat itself like O.A.R.
O.A.R.
does in this cd.

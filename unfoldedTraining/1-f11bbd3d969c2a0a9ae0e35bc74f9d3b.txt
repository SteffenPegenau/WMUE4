I loved the series UNTIL the ripoff motion picture.I agree with all the other reviewers' negative comments.
Gargoyle 1,000,000 times more interesting.7.
The makers of this film insult the fans of the series.Here are the biggest things offensive about this movie:1.
No Marie, King, or any of the Nautilus crew?6.
Grandis, Samson, & Hanson turn against Jean and are thugs again?5.
Huh????
Nadia left Jean and became a gofer for a newspaper????
Opening credits and song vastly inferior to the tv show.3.
In the past 2 weeks, I watched every dvd of the Nadia series and just finished with the motion picture today.
Villian so dull.
Total waste.2.
First third are scenes from the earlier episodes.
!
After almost being ruler of Atlantis she becomes that?4.
At end of film, Nadia again leaves Jean???!!!!!!!!!
Terrible story.8.

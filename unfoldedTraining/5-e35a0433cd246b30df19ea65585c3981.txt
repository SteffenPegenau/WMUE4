They make me remember all the times I've cried and all the times I've smiled.
They make me cry.
His dad is best know for some legendary bass string bending in the jazz world but Josh has cornered the market on gut wrenching, heart-felt sentiments that are at once deathlike and birthright.
Literally hundreds of cds perchased by me on Amazon and this is my first review.
It might be raining there but the sting of drops will feel amazing on your brain.
All are courageously brilliant.
Go figure.
Quite simply because Spain (or more specifically Josh Haden) breaks the same endless silence with a whisper of love and pure genius unknown to most pop music musings.
Go to Spain immidiately.
Only one other music maker has this power...Scott Walker.
...but I kinda like the music.
This man is a fractured-tormented-childish weaver of sublime emoting.
There is virtually no diffence between this and the first two Spain cds.
they make me smile.
why break the silence?

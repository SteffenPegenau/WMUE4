The Terror was gripping and a page turner.
That's it.
Thought it was engrossing.
Almost lost faith with Simmons.
Illium was also great.
Read Illium and loved it.
Put it down.
My two cents.
Characters and plots and sub-plots all over the place.
When it came time to "wake" up a new character by having sex with her sleeping form, I gave up.
This book was just not as good and thoroughly boring.
If you want sexed up and pointless characters all over the place in an ever-confusing plot then read this.
Couldn't wait to finish it all up with Olympos.
If I wanted that I'd read the The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty.
If you want an engrossing and complext sci-fi book, read the Dune books by Frank Herbert.
Ugh.
But alas... no.
I actually stopped caring.
But this... and then the travesty of Drood.
I like Simmons work.

I hardly have enough time to write a review let alone read a 500-page book.
It is repetitive and stale.
Last time I ever listen to him.
(I should have read the online reviews first.)
Perhaps this is my angst being vocalized but I just wasted an enormous amount of time.
The book is filled with fluff that is neither well written nor compelling.
To the author: Be Honest!
Arghhhhh!
This is nothing but a sophomoric dime novel wrapped in a title to allure in readers.
I was really hoping for some kind of twist at the end.
This is the perfect example that "You can not read a book by its cover."
Even if I put in the spoiler for the story and you still read it, you would look back and say it did not matter.
But you should know...it has next to nothing to do with the Free Masons or The Book of Fate.
First time and last time I ever read this author.
However, I needed an escape so I picked this one up on someone saying it has sold a lot of copies and was in the DaVinci Code family.

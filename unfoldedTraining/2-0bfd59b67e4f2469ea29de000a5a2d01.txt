And lyrics along the lines of "I drink till I'm drunk and I smoke till I'm senseless" and "I f--- you in the a--."
But hey, so was "The Velvet Underground And Nico"!
Now THIS is weird.
Okay.
I'm sitting here staring at the keyboard trying to explain what it sounds like and I'm unsuccessful.
Pot hallucination experiences put on record, I guess.
Tricky, onetime Massive Attack rapper, teams up with gravelly-voiced singer Martine, and makes one of the weirdest albums you'll ever hear.
with song titles like "Ponderosa" and "Suffocated Love".
In fact, I'd go so far and call it the "The Velvet Underground and Nico" of our generation.
It's all very VERY surreal.It's also very VERY unlistenable.
REALLY weird.
Unique percussion and static melodies.
Ever heard the song "Downs" from Big Star's "Third Sister Lovers"?
That's what a lot of this album sounds like.
Some call it "trip-hop" but I say this sounds NOTHING like "Dummy" or "Mezzanine"!

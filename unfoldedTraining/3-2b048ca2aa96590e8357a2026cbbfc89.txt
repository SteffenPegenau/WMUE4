Murder after murder...and the police response was always to meet and talk (heck!he even bought doughnuts in this one!!
It seemed to be disjointed, unfocused even.
I am a big fan of the Women's Murder Club books.
Ah, well.
I am a new reader of this author, but I am reading Patterson pretty fast.
I thought you could read these in any order.
I just think this one was largely filler and fluff.
Perhaps I would have been liked it more if this hadn't been the first Alex Cross for me?
Wow...was I disappointed!
A new lead in the case didn't produce redoubled efforts or gearing up, more likely a trip home to DC for Alex.
)..no real police work like Lt. Lindsey Boxer would do.
I guess I should reiterate that I am a fan.
I didn't find the name Nana Mama at all believable.
My first Alex Cross was Violets are Blue.
Did I miss something?
The 5th Horseman should put the world to rights.

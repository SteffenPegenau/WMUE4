The blue light is pretty cool.
If you plan on using this in a big room then you need to look for something bigger and more expensive.
The price of this little gem is the reason I gave it only three stars.
This is a pretty small humidifier which is pretty cool.
It fits anywhere.
You can use it as a night light or a simple light when you need to get up in the middle of the night.
I'm going to put black tape over them.
The fan that blows the mist out could have been just a little big stronger.
There are no filters and it's very easy to clean up.
They are pointless.
For $40 dollars I feel this is a little overpriced.Overall i'm pretty happy with my purchase.
However, there are some cons.To start, there are blue lights above the buttons which are VERY annoying at night.
So far (2 weeks) this has worked pretty good.
This humidifier is for smaller rooms.
It is also pretty quiet.

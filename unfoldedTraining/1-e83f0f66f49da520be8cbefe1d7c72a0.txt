This is a great looking set but quality is very poor.
I was so happy to finally own the whole set before the movie came out.
Not even 12 mins.
I bought this set when it was the goldbox special.
It was glued to the paper!
The disc will not play and skips.
and it is still skipping all over terrible quality!
I tried the next disc which was also defective on the back, glue and marked, and it would not play.
If you want to watch the discs, buyers beware!
After reading the reviews of bad disc I decided to watch some tonight.
I did not even make it passed the first page which is the two discs.
Sad, it was a great deal.
If you want to look at the box this is for you.
I could not even get the first disc out!
I am returning these and will not be asking for an exchange due to the fact other buyers have the same problem.
After removing it I attempted to clean the glue with a disc cloth, it did not matter.

(And I am a die hard Ann Rice fan!
Why oh why is this Vook offered at the kindle store for Kindle users!!!
Are you kidding me!
First of all the "Vook" thing is completely non-existent.
I mean, I read everything no questions asked!)
A definite disappointment.
It's not a Vook, just a plain old short story and not a very good one at that!
!
A Kindle!
I think I'll just forget this whole fiasco ever happened!!
Second, do the editors think readers are a bunch of blithering idiots?
The Kindle store!
This whole thing must be a joke!
Finally, the story itself is week and shallow and very disjointed.
At the beginning of each "chapter" there is a speel about this video content not being supported on Kindle.
And guess what I'm reading it on!
At least in my version there were certain words highlighted which when clicked on took you to an online dictionary!
Well, guess where I bought it!

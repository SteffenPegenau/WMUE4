Renee Zellweger, you are very talented.
WHY??!?
Did somebody have pictures?
But Renee, this is not the phone book.
And I think you know that.
Why, Renee?
Why did you do it, Renee?
Were they possibly more compromising than this?
You would say, "Bee removal service" and crinkle your eyes and I would beat my own brains out for sheer joy.
You must have known this was a bad film.
Listen to me, Renee: I would watch you read the phone book.
!
I find that hard to believe.
WHY?
WHY?

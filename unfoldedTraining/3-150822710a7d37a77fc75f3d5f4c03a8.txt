It is an entertaining movie, but it is far from epic.
I want to see Batman kicking butt.
The acting is great.
This film had too little of that.
There should have been many more battles between Batman and the bad guys.
It is worth a watch, but do not expect anything supremely entertaining.
As I said, Batman was a dud in this film.
Understand that firstly.
Give him a lozenge.
This tale is more cerebral.
It has some thrills, but nothing like the previous two movies.
Bane and Catwoman and Levitt's cop character were more promising and interesting personalities.
The worst actor is actually Christian Bale, unfortunately, with his stupid sore throat Batman.
I felt like this was more of a drama than a superhero tale.
Catwoman steals the show.
Batman is coming to terms with his place, with himself, with his city.
The Sandman is in this film, but he does nothing.
Without her this movie would have been pretty boring.

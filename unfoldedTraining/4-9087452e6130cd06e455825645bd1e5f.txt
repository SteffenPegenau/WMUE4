Get other albums like Sticky Fingers, Beggers Banquet, and Let It Bleed and you'll see why they are one of the greatest band to grace earth.
Listen to Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin as well.
He's great and so is Keith.
Nothing can go wrong.
This album is average.
Afterall, this is the Rolling Stones.
Mick is one of the greatest frontman.
Oh and avoid Green Day and Nirvana.
tracks.
Rough Justice and Streets of Love are my fav.
It's way better than what's on MTV.
I'm not saying it's bad.
Their only decent album was In Utero.
Anything else....forget it.
They're in their 60s and still kick major a**.
Hands down.

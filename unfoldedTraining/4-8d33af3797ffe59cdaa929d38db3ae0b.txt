I have the eye control.
85% it works and its great.
I have had the camera for 2.5 years and shot probably around 100 rolls with it.Now its a great camera.
I used it twice but it gave me great results.
I love the feel of the camera.With all its defects I love the camera and might go in for the same.
Low light focus is not so good but with the speedlight(420EX) it focus in a sec.
The depth of preview button is at time hard to findI love the fash 4 frames per second.
This is a disadvantage.
What a difference.
More over the the partial region of the camera is not well defined.
Its given me some awesome pictures.
I like the metering except the fact that is does not have spot metering.
Its got the features for a beginner to reach a serious amature role with low cost.
Till yesterday I was all praises for this camera and would have given 5 stars.
Well yesterday it died on me.
But it does fail and irritates me at times.

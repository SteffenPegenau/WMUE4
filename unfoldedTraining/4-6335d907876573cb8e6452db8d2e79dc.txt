I was sorta disappointed in this book but hopefully the next one will be better.
The books were so much better when Liz and Conner were together or even when they were apart and Alanna wasn't there.
The usual.
The only interesting part is the Melissa going after Aaron to make Will and Cherie mad.
I like the books to focus more on the twins which they don't seem to be doing lately.
Anyway about the book.
The only reason I rated this a 4 was because I love the series.
I dont think the new Conner's as cute as the other one but I don't think he's ugly.
Alanna and Connor fight and get back together.
This book was only okay.
And that blows up in her face.
About the cover models; They are different and I dont like them as well either as some of the other people mentioned.
But to lalenalefay, they did mention that Trent was black and never said anything about him having long hair.
I hate stories about Alanna so much.
Andy tries stand-up comedy again.
I had to force myself to get through this book.

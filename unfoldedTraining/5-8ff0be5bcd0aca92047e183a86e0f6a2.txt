my mother in law just so happened to give me a pack of these after finding out how much he was hurting and pulling his stomach in all the time and WHAT A MIRACLE!!!
i tried every formula from generic to the most expensive alimentum which actually helped a little bit.
i was so relieved to finally be able to get some rest and my little one was FINALLY able to drink his milk without crying immediatly afterwards.
i mean he literally cried all day and all night.
i never slept.
they are expensive, but please please please.
i was getting so depressed from not being able to help him and not sleeping.
i literally tried every bottle in walmart.
when my son went to the bottle and even before than he was soooooo colicky.
it was literally like a wonder bottle.
they are soooo worth it!!
i wanted to kiss the man or woman who made these.
i mean it.
the thought of me not having to burst into tears every time he ate was worth it.
it was a nightmare for both of us.

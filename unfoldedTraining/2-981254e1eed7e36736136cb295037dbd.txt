Noise level is loud but bearable.
Ion?
The dual exhaust tubes are huge - looks like 6" diameter... not very attractive going from unit to window.
Does not explain what each function does.
I will probably return and get a window unit.
Wrong.
I never understand why a company can not write a good manual.
I can still talk on phone without distraction.
I couldn't figure out window adjusters - so I have a 4" space on my casement window I need to block off.
Manual is terrible.
My office is 12x13 so I assumed a 1200 BTU would cool it down fast.
and the symbols on unit are not intuitive.
Auto?
I just got this unit 4 days ago for my home office.
It will cool the room but so far I have not been able to get room temp under 76 degrees... room is comfortable but if it can not cool a small room to 72 forget a large room.

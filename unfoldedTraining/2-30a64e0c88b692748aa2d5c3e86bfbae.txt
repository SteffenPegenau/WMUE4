Just type in nintendogs plush on the search bar.
But by then I'd stoped playing with it.
It never did stop working.
It's on my self now, but onley because it is a cut dog, it is a quelity toy.
It amused them to.
When my mom came home it amused her to.
I still havn't played with it.
The next time I played it was at a family party, I showed a group of people some of the tricks it could do.
It was amazing, at first at least.
I played with it for the first three weeks or so.
It worked just fine, and amused my grandma, my sister, and me.
When I got home, I ran to get batteries so I could play with it.
Now I want a nintendog plush.
I never played with it since.
I got this toy from my grandma, and I named her pearl.
When I put some of my animals up in our attic, I took the batteries out, and havn't put them back in.
Soon it had us laughing with joy.
I was 11, so mabey it was age.
To find out more about that you hav to read my review on it.
It wasn't that it didn't stop working.

My main complaint is that the macros are very limited.
The RF works great.
The remote buttons seem a little cheaper than the last one I had from this company.This would get five stars with the following changes to the product:1.
The button layout is great.
Bring back the old plastic d-pad too.
Also, you cannot program a macro to any of the other hard buttons.
Allow macros on any hard or soft button2.
Bring back the old buttons.
This metal one is not as good.
I can keep my cabinet door closed and I don't have to point the remote at the item I want to control.
You can only program one on/off macro for the on/off buttons.
They were plastic and pressed down better.
I replaced an older Universal Remote with this one to get the RF technology.
This doesn't work if you have different macro sequences depending on what device you are using.
You can only program macros to the soft buttons up top.

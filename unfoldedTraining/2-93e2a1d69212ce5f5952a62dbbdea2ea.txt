And he (...).
There is a guy rapping in spanish in some songs!
Kick My A$$ is a good songs until it gets ruined at the end as well.
If they didn't have that lame rapper in some of the songs, this could be an ok album.
It's catchy, but bad.
That's besides the point.
And what the heck is wrong with Tim McGraw?
This is not country.
Big deal, get over it.
Everybody who thinks this is actual good music is a moron.
At least he doesn't have spanish rapping black hicks on his records, which is absurd.
Just because CMT, which is a network run by sellouts anyway, shows their video does not make this country.
Last time I checked, he has made better "country" music than these clowns.
My 12 year old brother can freestyle better than he can rap.
This is not a breath of fresh air into the country music world, it's just more music from the trailer park like Kid Rock.

It's a fun book to read.
Sami is an ambitious girl and I found her to be loveable.
So she moves into an apartment with a model, Rain.
I would kill to be in Sami's shoes.
!
I really recommend it!
Enter the totally Hott, Vin.
It'll put you in goos spirits and make you want to jump a plane to New York.
Now with a six pack like Nancy describes I've no idea how she could pass him up for Bruce.
The combination of the main characters (Sami, Vin, and Rain) is a real up-lifting feeling.
Read the book to see if Sami and Vin get together.
Yet when Bruce steals her designs she feels a little differently.
Right starring you in the face?
Yet still can't seem to find the hottness of Vin irresistable.
It also makes you think a little about your love life.
I found the book to be funny as well as romantic.
Ok, so Sami is an aspiring clothes designer.
Is Mr.

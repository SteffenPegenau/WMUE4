But they give you the story and its something that my whole family can watch together.
I'm sure any true dbz fan would give an arm and a leg to have them all in English.
The only regret that I have is that I can't get all of the episodes in this good of quality.
True, they are edited and some things are cut out.
There are actually 531 episodes total.
I know i would.
I just wish somebody (Funimation) would make all of them available in English.
These are my personal favorites.
Then, the last are the Dragon Ball GT episodes.
I have them all but some are in japanese with subtitles which makes it hard to enjoy the episode, and some are just dubbed in English.
I didn't really like these ones, but they are good none the less.
Then there are 291 episodes of DBZ.
176 are just Dragon Ball, They are before DBZ.
I was very pleased with what I saw.
Hopefully this will inspire more people to try to get Funimation pumping out those episodes, it would definately be worth their time.

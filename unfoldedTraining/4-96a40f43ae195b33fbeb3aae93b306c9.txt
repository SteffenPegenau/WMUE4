Just buy it and if ya dont like it go sell it on Ebay and get some of you precious dough back.
Dammit...i want this disc badly.
there are so many damn reviews so if you happen to read this i say this is great.
Its quite different from Hybrid Theory.
I havent bought it yet but from hearing the samples of oints Of Authority and En TH nd (or h.e.
lotsa ppl may dissagree but i dont know what else to say.
Unlike others i believe this IS worth your money.
Its more hip-hop and rap-ish but if ya like the type of music go buy the friggin cd.
I would.
I love the new hip-hop-ish vibe in the songs.
u spell it) are great.
so start with hybrid theory but i dont give so just go on...BUY IT!
!
Buy let me tell ya a lil secret...i dont know the band members names or much about em but muh freind had hybrid theory so um...i fell in love with it and intend to buy that too.
I think it rox even tho it doesnt have a really rock sound.

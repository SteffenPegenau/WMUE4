Seems like a film that started with great intentions and the best in the business, but just falls so flat.
What a disappointment this was.
I thought, with the Cohens, Clooney and Zeta-Jones, how could this go wrong?
Clooney and Jones have no chemistry at all.
What happened?
For some reason, this just never does jell.
None.
He seems to be trying too hard to pull this all together.
Can't decide if it's the script, the acting, the production - don't know.
Too bad, could have been spectacular if it had worked.
She underplays the role to the point of being bland, like she'd rather be anyplace else than on the set of this film.
I love screwball comedy and fantasy fable, but this is a pale attempt at either, for some reason.
But it does go very, very wrong.
Seems like this film was rushed and patched together.
No spark, nothing.

A story would be nice.
If you are wanting to see your boy and his hooks, however, this is not the right story.
Look a little more scared in the hole.
Don't breathe when you are dead.
A party is thrown in the honor of the puzzlebox, which seems to have a lot of followers - considering the turnout.
Amongst the people here are fourf friends, some people, a Dad, and what seems like a place that wants their blood.
-Where's my autopen, pivcking up spirits: Yes, I already told them the plotline is right there.
Yeah, about that..One thing about this movie is that it is a slasher film.
The man in charge is just a bit too greedy to tell you the truth.When you watch this you can automatically feel it coming out.
Shessh.There is a lot that could be said.
If you want people getting it bad ways, you are in the right building.
Actors, acting is nice.
And so on.
It helps the blood.
I go 2.5/5

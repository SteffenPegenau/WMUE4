I know we're supposed to feel sorry for her, and I did to a certain extent, but I don't think that excused her behavior.
I enjoyed Body Check and this was a great disappointment to me.
Theresa was a horrible person, I had a hard time liking her.
I feel strongly here, unfortunately it's negative.
At all!!
I was shocked when I came online to see the reviews for this book and saw that it had a high average.
She was a snob.
Give me a break.
She was horrible to him.
One date, then in the last few pages they get together.
I couldn't get past that.
I rarely write reviews unless I feel strongly about the book.
Why??
They aren't even dating during the book.
Huh?
Because she said something witty to him once?
And I don't understand why Michael would pine for her for TWO years!!

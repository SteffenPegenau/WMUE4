I Can Do Bad All By Myself has a good story line/plot.
Bad attempt at "comedy?"
Taraji P. Henson has a great future as an actress, as does Adam Rodriguez.
I have every Tyler Perry dvd to date.
I enjoy Tyler Perry's writing, directing, producing and acting.
Should have been ANY ONE but the character of MEDEA for the plot to build around.
Otherwise, the acting was very good.
Made no sense, very distracting, nothing to do with the story.
This one is average Tyler Perry, disappointing to say the least.
What ruined the movie is the character MADEA being written into the story/plot.
If you are a Tyler Perry collector like I am, buy it and be disappointed with me.
Mary J Blige and Gladys Knight need acting lessons and should never have been written into the script in the first place.
If not, wait for it to come out on TV and save your money.
WHY????
Tyler Perry has a knack putting the right hollywood actress/actor into his characters.

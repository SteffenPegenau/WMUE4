Tech support sucks.
Sent back to the GPS store for an exchange.
That really sucks to have to buy cards at that price.
The tech support guy I talked to was difficult to talk to.
To use the topo and marine functions you have to buy memory cards loaded with the program at $200 a pop.
Will see.
Half that I could swallow.
Just went on trip from Boise Id to Las Vegas and the new unit locked up and kept returning to the Blue Screen.
He sounded like he was revved up on Red Bull and took forever to get him on the line.
Ordered crossover in January and while entering waypoints it locked up.
So far skeptical.
Downloaded update last night and it appears it fixed the problem.
Contacted Magellan and they said a software update would fix it.
I was ready to try to exhange it for a different unit but Magellan said this would work-Hopefully we will see.
Further use, more money spent on sd cards will tell if it performs as expected.

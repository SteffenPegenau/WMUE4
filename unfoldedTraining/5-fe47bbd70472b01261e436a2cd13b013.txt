I dont own many other soundtracks but this is a must for anyone.
I own the soundtrack to all 3 films.
The platinum edition is pretty damn sweet.
I cannot gush enough about this movie.
And I absolutely adore the score to this.
I love them all.
This is my favorite film.
It is an absolute MUST for any movie lover in general.
If it was 6 hours, I would still watch it without complain.
I could go on and on.
Yes the movie is 4 hours but for people who love movies and love great movies, it shouldnt matter how long a film is.
I loved the intertwined extended/deleted scenes.
Peter Jackson created a masterpiece that noone could possibly match.
I wish other directors did that more often.
The acting is wonderful, I even stopped cringing at Elijah Wood's acting after this film.
Along with the other 2 films of course.
Probably ever.
At least not anytime soon.His attention to every detail is evident in this movie.

He would have.
Oh, please!
By the third time, I was forced to agree with the reviewer who said Chaucer would've loved this.
The first time I saw this movie, I was screaming in disbelieving horror throughout.
One other note - mute the volume during Robbie Williams attempt at Queen (final song).
!
However, my sons loved it and it was on HBO, so the second time they watched it, I could see some merit.
I really question the judgement of some of these reviewers.
Ledger is great, and Jocelyn actually has a mind of her own.
The commoner rising up on his own (basically) honest merits comes straight from Chaucer.
Yes, some of the dialogue is cliched, the Black Prince was not noted for progressiveness, but the cast makes it rise up above such picayune things.
Now THAT is desecration!
First, I am an English teacher, and a big fan of Chaucer and his times.
A work of Satan..??!
See it with an open mind and see for yourself.

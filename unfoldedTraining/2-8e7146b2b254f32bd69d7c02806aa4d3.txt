I feel I wasted my $12.00.
Laura Pausini sang off key, so did Sting and some others.
With great excitement I purchased this DVD.
Maybe if I was, it would have been a better experience.
Better luck next time!
I wished I had.
I did not read all the reviews but I don't usually do that anyway.
That is, of course, an all time favorite of all.
Zucchero was terrific while singing a duet with the Maestro and another piano solo.
The best part was at the end when Luciano sang "Nessum Dorma".
Andrea Bocelli was superb.
Sherril Milnes sang a couple Christian songs at the beginning the program.....also very nice.
The floutist was truly superb however.
It must be that I am not Italian.
Most guest singers were sad and cannot be compared to him so this review might not be fair.
It was spiritual and quite a surprise that Christian songs were chosen in Muslim ruled Jordan.

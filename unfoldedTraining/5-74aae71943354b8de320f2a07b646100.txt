Its basically a men's watch.
But I never used those extra features on my other watches.
In low light the time is difficult to read.
I miss having no backlight.
But its also a good watch for adults.
Hour minute and second plus the day, month and date.No other features.
I was a little apprehensive because of some of the negative reviews but decided to throw it into my shopping cart when I was buying some other things on Amazon.This is an excellent watch at the discounted price and a great buy.
I wish the numerals were thicker on the display.Its a very attractive watch.
If you have kids, they will love it guaranteed and show it off to their friends.
Its light weight.
Silver with a metallic stretch band.
It looks good.
At the price its now selling on Amazon, I would recommend this watch as a good buy.
It tells you the exact time, exactly.
Its a basic watch...just tells you the time.

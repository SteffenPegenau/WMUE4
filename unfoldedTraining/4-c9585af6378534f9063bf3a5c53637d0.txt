Ok, the movie sounded like a tear-jerker.
There were parts where my mouth was hanging open and I was shocked by actions in the movie.
The movie turned that idea on its head.
Sandra Bullock should be nominated for an Oscar -- or something.
Boy was I wrong.
Thanks to some creative editing, time sequences, and just brilliant acting by Sandra Bullock, this movie is worth the price of admission and cost of DVD.
I actually shouted out, "OH NO!"
during two parts.
Brilliant direction.
Brilliant editing.
This movie kept me in my seat and in front of the TV from start to finish.
A very good movie.
Having not read the previews, I was expecting to see a wife going through the grief process after losing her husband.
She knocked it out of the park with this movie.
Nope.

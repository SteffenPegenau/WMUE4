I couldn't wait for this to arrive but after watching it, I felt short changed.
Because I am.
Does it sound like I'm complaining?
It felt like it jumped from one extreme to another!
What happened to Lick It Up, Animalize and Asylum?
I can't wait for Volume III (with such sarcasm).
Where are the rest of the promo videos?
When this is being promoted as the "Definitive Kiss" and alot of stuff is missing, how the hell can this be the "definitive Kiss"?
Why did they only include excerpts of "Countdown"?
What happened to the wonderful documentary from Australia "The Inner Sanctum"?
Where the hell is the rest of the Tom Snyder interview?
Good!
and the packaging.
Four stars go to the sound, Kiss In Attack of The Phantom in Widescreen (!!!)
Wow.

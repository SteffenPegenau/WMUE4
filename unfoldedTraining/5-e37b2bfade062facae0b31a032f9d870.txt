It has a good plot.2.
Pick who you want to fight in each battle from out of a possible 43 characters.5.
Can be confusing at first.2.
A little to much talking between the battles.
This may be one of my favorite games ever.
Sometimes, when I would be in a hurry, I would have to skip the plot in order to save the game.Can go either way:When a character dies in battle you can't get him back.
A lot of hours of gameplay.7.
Good art and cut scenes.6.
However it also adds more strategy to the battles.9/10I beleive this game is worth buying.
If you're bored you can make a new game and try using different people and strategies.Cons:1.
There is also a strong main character that you don't have to worry about dying.3.
You need to use at least some strategy to win.4.
Here are its pros and cons.Pros:1.
Good replay value.
Instead you have to restart the level.

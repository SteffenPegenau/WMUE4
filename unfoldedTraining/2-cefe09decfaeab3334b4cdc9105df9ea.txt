After I added cream... well....
The taste was okay but not as good as a drip maker.
My cat was wide-eye and scared when she heard it growling and spitting.
The unit comes in white also.I couldn't believe my ears!
The clean up was decent I suppose.
There's three cup sizes to choose from when you brew.A very large unit.
My wife yelled from the bedroom " What the $*&# is that?".
Guess I won't be using this early while others are still sleeping.Well I tried a few cups.
I think you get the idea.I'm afraid that the Black & Decker "Home Cafe" is quite a disappointment.
If the unit at the very least served hot coffee then it may of been worth the purchase.
This is a very noisily unit.
The one thing that disappointed me the most was the temperature.
As large as most 8-12 cup drip makers.
I could actually drink the cup right down like water if I wanted to.
It was luke warm right out of the machine.
The Home Cafe from Black & Decker is for brewing one cup of coffee at a time.

"eyes" is a great opener.
the lyrics of the first verse are awesome "i ain't never been to heaven/ but i've been told/ angel's in heaven got/ sweet jelly rolls".
i personally like most of the songs on the first half of the album.
however, i will talk about the first and last song.
rockin intro, soulful R&B chorus.
"be so glad" is a great song.
the rap is F**king awesome.
the main sound allman brothers-esque southern rock, but it's pretty diverse and the album has a good pop feeling all around.
the second half of the album is mostly songs with lyrics about sun rises and sunsets.
i'm not going to talk about all of the songs.
it's bluesy, soulful, rockin, psychadelic.
the song ends with an allman brothers-esque instrumental.
it's still great though.
this album is a great.
overall, i approve.
it's like blues and rock and hip-hop rolled into one.

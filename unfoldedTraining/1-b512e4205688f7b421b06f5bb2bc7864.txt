I usually use a non electric razor.
Unfortunately the razor left my face feeling chafed.
I tried recharging and tried turning the switch on and off, no sound out of the razor.I got hold of Panasonic.
Today when I called they told me they were having problems getting the shipping labels to customers!
I called them 5 times in 15 days asking what happened to the email they were supposed to send me.
Later, I tried to use the razor and it would not turn on!
They offered to reimburse me for mailing my unit to them.
After using the razor for maybe 10 times I put it away for a few months.
They told me they mailed me a coupon, I never got it.
I was excited that I could get this razor wet and use shaving cream.
I am shipping it today.
I was excited to hear that there is a 1 year warranty on their product, they even offered to send me a free shipping label.
I bought this razor for my birthday in 2008.
They LIED to me!
Wish me luck!

rap'n bout how much money u have aint talent, to me itz brag'n.
dey eitha talk bout the past or the present strugglez dey have encountered.

u dont see all da otha rappaz talm bout how much money dey got.
itz like u repeat'n yo self jus to different beatz.
enough is enough.
we all know yall got money so u aint gotta remind us in every song u make.
im sick of hear'n bout all da ice an ridez dey have.
but dayum give me a break.
sometimez the beatz even sound the same.
rap bout street life (da thangz u been thru grow'n up).

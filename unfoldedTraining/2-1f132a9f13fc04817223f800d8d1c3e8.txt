they will in no way influence my life.
it looks painful to stand.
nice review adie, fairytaleprincess!
believe me people do wear skirts that short.
at least bratz can stand on their own.
and also who cares if they're unrealistic.
that may be why mgae made their feet big anyway
need i remind you of... BARBIE!
in school even!
if you take their shoes off.
i have a ton on my shelf, 18 actually and they can ALL stand well.
and these my scene OMG my sister has one.
MUST be painful if they're feet are a size 1 shoe size.
not me though but these are dolls they're just fun to play with.
i couldn't agree more.

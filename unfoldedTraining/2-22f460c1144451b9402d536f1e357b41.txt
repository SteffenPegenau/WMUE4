But that's it.
I suppose I could call it kind of cute at times.
I think the cover really says it all.
And Sookie... well, I can think of several words to describe her, none of which are very flattering.
Know how when you see a movie with a character that just clearly can't act?
I know he's a vampire, but he could have a little more depth.
But that doesn't seem right for a vampire book.
That's what Sookie reminds me of.
I don't know.
And you want to like her but it's just bad...?
And she spends half the novel crying.
It was different, so I will probably give the second one a shot.
But, she reminds me of a bad actress.
I've read various contemporary vampire series and figured I'd give this a try.
The vampire, Bill, has no personality whatsoever.
He's kind of boring.

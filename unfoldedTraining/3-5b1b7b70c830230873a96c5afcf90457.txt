Morning Dew has Phil pumping and Jerry rippin' But the vocals are really rough here.
The down side here is Jerry's vocals.
The bass player in any band is always over looked and under appreciated.
while Heart felt and full of passion,they are rough and harsh.
If you are a fan of fine vocals pass on it.
If you love the Dead do not miss this one.
Phil plays the 6 string bass and the bottom end is the deepest I ever heard from any bass player.
He's Gone and the MSG Jam is by far the high lite.
This is the irony of the CD.
jam with The two Keyboard players.
This is very unique.
Plus he is playing all over the place, he stands out not only from a tonal aspect, but also from the amount ot notes he plays.
Here we have Phil letting loose with a great improv.
The real story on this CD is Phil Lesh.
The sound that comes from Vince's keyboard is also unpleasent.

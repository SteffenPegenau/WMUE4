She'd run and jump and pop all the bubbles and I'd live happily ever after.
Awesome for stacking.
Maybe it was my expectations that led to my disapointment.
If you tear a piece of spider web down and wad it up in your fingers what you have left is what these bubbles look like.
My niece didn't like that.Once they deflate they leave a residue on your fingers.
I envisioned filling a room with bubbles while my niece napped having her awake to a bubble kingdom waiting for her.
Just wasn't what I expected.
They deflate.
They stick to your fingers until you squeeze the shell, at which point they release the air and deflate.
When you touch them they don't pop.
A thin, white sticky residue.
But...These bubbles don't pop.
Pick up one bubble with your finger and touch another bubble and another and form a bubble chain.We got some fun out of it.
Kind of annoying.What they're good for: Stacking.
Once airborne they form a hardened shell to hold the air inside.

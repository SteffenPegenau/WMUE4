What are your favorite books?
.
The handwritten pages have ideas at the top and bottom to get you writing: How have you amazed yourself?
The pages are pretty blank, so if you want a psychobabble self-help book, this ain't it.
This book is odd.
.
I'm sure SARK wouldn't mind.
What unusual private things do you enjoy doing?
SARK is weird.
Design your own special dream space.
Live juicy!
It's calming, encouraging, and if some of the pages you don't want to do, don't.
It's a JOURNAL, and the author encourages YOU to write about YOUR LIFE: happy things, scary things, dreams .
And she prompts you to look at situations in your life from a positive light.
And fun and great and unusual and full of positive energy.

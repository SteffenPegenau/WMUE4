I replaced the T8 ballast in the one and converted the second to a T-12 bulb and ballast for about $25 bucks.
I now have two working units.
T12 bulbs are commonplace.
Here's a better idea though: Go to Home Depot.
Rather than risk sending a third, Sam Ash refunded my purchase and told me to keep both defective units.
Finally arrived (Sam Ash was great about the problem with the order.
Had to call back three times to receive the replacement.
Arrived with bulb intact but fluorescent ballast was faulty.
These T-8 bulbs are VERY hard to find for individual sale, and expensive.
Buy a cheap T12 fluorescent fixture and a T12 fluorescent bulb.
Took too long, but they took responsibility.)
Together maybe $20-$35 depending on the fixture you select.
Ordered one.
Called Sam Ash (where it actually comes from) and they said they would sent another no charge - keep the first one, too difficult to ship back.
Second finally arrived - with broken bulb.

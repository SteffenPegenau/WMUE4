Baseball seems to require the most input but it is slow.
A good game.
This is especially fun for kids.
My son enjoys picking the teams as much as he enjoys playing the game.
My 6 year old son enjoys the game.
What he enjoys may not be what you expect.
You really only play one player.
My son likes soccer the best.
Have fun.
The game allows kids to choose pro teams and pro football players (as kids.)
Plays are available but do not make much sense to a young kid.
The computer does a lot of the work.
A neat feature is an ability to mold a player, picking build, sex, hair style/color and playing ability.
Playing the game is rather cumbersome, however.
We've tried some of the others, backyard baseball and soccer (not basketball yet.)

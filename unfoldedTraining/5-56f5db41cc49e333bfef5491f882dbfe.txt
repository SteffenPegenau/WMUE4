Some people have compared her to Alanis Morissette or Sheryl Crow.
A nice blend of Rock/Pop and Blues.
"Me," I only heard the first 10 seconds of it.
Be sure and listen to "Have a Cry" and "Me" before you judge her voice.
It caught my attention right away.
And Kina really sings on that track!
But it has a unique beat.
"Have a Cry" has a soulful swing like Sheryl Crow's leaving Las Vegas.
I immediately began searching for other songs from her album.
Of those three songs that I heard, I'm definitely going to buy it.
I first heard this single (Girl from the Gutter) on Realplayer Take 5.
But she stands on her own with an original style.
This girl has some great tunes!
I think she holds a slight similarity.
I almost didn't think it was Kina until I heard her voice.
But it's more bluesy (is that a word?).

It's supposed to poke fun.
This album is HILARIOUS.
They really make fun of white folks like me and it's funny.
It's different, but refreshing.
I think the songs are great and the commercials are funny too.
I read some previous reviews of this album and it prompted me to write this.
Ever hear of Richard Pryor or Chris Rock?
Also, the music is awesome!
The skit about the scramble word board will make you cry it's so funny.
Yes it's a trip through an old Soul Train show.
!
Get this album y'all.
It's comedy.
AS for the folks who "don't get it" or "blacks will be offended", GET A CLUE.
It's COMEDY..PARODY.

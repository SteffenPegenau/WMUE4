All the songs are remarkable.
Beforehand I thought Bill's still alive, when I knew that Bill had passed away on 1980 Sep. the tears in my eyes prevented me from reading.
It's by his close friend--Gene Lees.
I finally got his cd a few days before.
How could he make tunes come into lives.
As I read on I know more about bill.
You dream you float you want more.
Before I bought this cd I knew nothing about bill.
He guide you to his music world and affect your own.
I was reading the liner notes while listening.

It's so right that he lived for his music and his piano.
What a pity!
How sensative!
What I knew was just his name.

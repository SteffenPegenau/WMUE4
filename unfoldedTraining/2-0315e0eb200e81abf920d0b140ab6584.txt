Hope it was helpful!
I have meant to sew the bum seam up again, but I haven't got the time yet.
A very nice uniform, IMO.
I didn't rate this item because something is wrong with my computer and I can't rate things.
It fit perfectly except for the bum area.
It was a pain to go to the bathroom in, but all jumpsuits are.
I would rate it 5/5 stars, points, or whatever.
I like my uniform very much and I don't regret buying it at all.
I bought this uniform last October for Halloween.
Everyone liked it very much, I got lots of compliments and aproving looks.
The seam came out about an inch-and-a-half.
I think I will cut some excess fabric from somewhere else and put another piece in.
Of course I am known for my big bum, so it was not really a surprise.
Not much.
(In My Opinion) Well, that's my opinion.

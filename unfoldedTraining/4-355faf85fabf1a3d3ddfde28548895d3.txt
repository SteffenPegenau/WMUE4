Brian did everything possible to live.
But the pilot died of heart attack.
Brian was thirteen years old.
I could travel to the bush with Brian.
I could see his development.
I think this book is a checkered story.
He was so brave.
His one of lifelines was the hatchet that had given him by his mothor.The hatchet was Brian himself.
So he had to fly plane and decided to land it a near by lake.
This book made me excited.Sometimes I felt happy , sometimes I felt sad with Brian.
If you want to find yourself, you should read this book.
I learned how to survive.
Probably you can find the new way that you should advance.
Then he started to survive.
He rode on a small plane.

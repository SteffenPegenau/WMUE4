My husband and I loved this series.
Loved loved loved it!
But using popular rappers, musicians, athletes, and actors, to give thier opinion about our history just kind of added a "yuck" factor.
Overall...amazing series.
The ONLY thing that really bugged us both, was the use of celebrity opinions.
!
Keep the opinions to the scholars, the professors of notable universities, or people who are known for having the American qualities being portrayed.
Kind of killed the credibility and sacredness of the films at times.
Just minimizes the whole effect of the stories being told.
Such perserverance and sacrifice in the name of freedom.
Dont use celebrities.
I mean, had the celebrities been WELL KNOWN for being activists or history junkies, it would have been different.
There are so many things we learned that we never heard in school.
I have a new awe and appreciation (and even a little shame) for our history and predecessors.
Even our kids started watching with us.

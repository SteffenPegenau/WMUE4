I think I will buy an ortho disposable and try it.
It's been 4 days...nothing!
They worked in my garage...two mice in two days.
The only reason I didn't use them this time was I was expecting a war (more than one mouse) and it can get costly replacing the ortho traps!
I know I had a mouse in the kitchen because I saw it, my son saw it and there were mouse droppings under the sink.
I am not sure if I had one lone mouse or if the trap just doesn't work.
But, I will try one in my kitchen here and if it works, the Victor is no good.
Most people say, where there is one mouse, there are more.
I used a very small amount of peanut butter on the back wall as suggested, but no mouse.
If not, I may sound an all-clear!
Hhmmm!
So, assumed I would catch a mouse.
Since then, droppings have disappeared and no mouse has been caught!
:) I will let ya know the outcome!
To be fair, I also put out baits...but saw droppings for two days after and that's why I added the trap.

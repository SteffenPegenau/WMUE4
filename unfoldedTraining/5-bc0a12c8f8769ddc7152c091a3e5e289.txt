No big deal though.
When i am through in the shower, i take the soap out of the shower, and let it dry on the shelf.
In the shower the patchouli scent really comes out strong.
The scent is dead on.
I am 100% satisfied with this product.
The soap did clean my skin, and left a subtle patchouli scent.
As far as it being soap, i can not say much about how good it is, or isn't, because i am a man that is not interested in such things.
So if your green, this company caters to you.
Its not overpowering in any way.
So if your not wanted to be covered in the odor of patchouli, this is the soap for you.
Not to worry, this went away in the shower.
One thing I have been noticing lately is that the soap tends to disolve faster than my regular store bought soaps.
Zum Bar Goat's Milk Soap comes hand wrapped and boxed in recycled material.
The way i expect patchouli to smell.
Also the soap had a distinct black licorice smell right out of the box.

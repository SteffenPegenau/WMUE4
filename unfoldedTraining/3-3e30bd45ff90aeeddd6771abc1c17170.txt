My review is about the book called Pig and the Shrink.
Pig was a great person inside and out.
Tucker needed to win the science fair project to get into the Math and Science Academy School next year.
Tucker apologized to Pig at the science fair and decided to drop out.
During the experiment, Tucker and Pig become friends.
So obsessed, he lost Pig's friendship.
His experiment was on a weight loss program.
The experiment didn't work out very well and Pig was gaining weight.
Tucker realized that Pig's friendship wasn't worth losing over a science fair project.
He used Pig, short for Pighetti a classmate who is the largest kid in school.
It teaches a good lesson about friendship and not to judge people by their appearance.
It was fast paced and funny.
The main character is Tucker Harrison.
I recommend this book by Pamela Todd.
He also realized that even though Pig was big, he shouldn't have judged him by his appearance.
Pig wanted to stop but Tucker was obsessed to win.

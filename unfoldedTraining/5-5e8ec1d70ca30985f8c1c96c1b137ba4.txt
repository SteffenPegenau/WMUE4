Westside Story4.
So go out and get the CD.
Higher3.
We Ain't (Produced By Eminem)6.
This Is How We Do2.
ALmost all of the songs are hot and the beats are amazing (produced by Dr. Dre).
His DVD is about an hour long and also has lots of extras.
The DVD itself is worth the money.
It shows his life up until know, how he was shot, and his gang The Black Wall Street.
Here are some of my favorite songs:1.
Put You On The Game7.
The Game, Dr. Dre's protege, has some pretty crazy lyrics too as in "Higher"and life-based song "The Documentary".
This is a great CD.
The Documentary5.
THe CD/DVD combo receives a 5-Star and is worth every penny.
Start from Scratch (Produced By Dr. Dre)Also the DVD is the Documentary of his life.

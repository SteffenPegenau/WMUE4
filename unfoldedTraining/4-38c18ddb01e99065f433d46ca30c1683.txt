Even David agrees that he's no match for her.
He's not in much of the book.
What's that all about??
If you're a David Parker fan, you'll be a little disappointed.
Mr. Romkey made it a point to show just how evil and depraved she really is.
I would love to see another book where David Parker goes up against her.
The whole cruise thing is kinda over the top.
This book focused more on Niccoleta and less on David Parker.
I enjoyed this book very much, after having read I, Vampire and the Vampire Papers.
But, I think that just shows how powerful Niccoleta really is.
He's pretty pathetic.
There are so many characters that it's a bit hard to follow at times, especially the part about the voodoo priest.
The Vampire Papers didn't go into great detail about her past.
That would be a hell of a fight.
I really recommend the book, because you get a feel for Niccoleta.
The David Parker in this book is a shadow of his former self.

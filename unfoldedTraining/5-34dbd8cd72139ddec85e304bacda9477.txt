A blind werewolf doctor meets a younger woman who just has this feeling that she should be able to fly, and he can suddenly see her.
***** "There's No Such Thing as a Werewolf".
Yes!
Betsy-vamp meets Wyndham werewolf.
Another combo!
***** "A Fiend in Need".
***** "Monster Love".
Scottish werewolf in town to pay tribute to the new heir runs across a woman dressed as Santa.
Ooooh, a combo!
Antonia, the seer, non-Changing werewolf from Derik's Bane, and George the Fiend from the Betsy books.
***** "Santa Claws".
Great blend of humor and burning-hot steam.
Not many authors can write a bondage & rape scenario and still make me root for the hero.
Hot and hilarious, and daring.
Plus, there's a shout-out to Emma Holly, which is way cool.

Look who's in... 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Spyder Loc, Mobb Deep, M.O.P.
He has a great flow and great lyrics, but the beats ain't there.
That isn't his fault.
Yayo is great.
But I was expecting more beats like these tracks on the album.
If you are just about the beats... still cop this album!
!
Honestly, I was a little disappointed.
and Olivia (so hot!!!).
Some were saying Yayo is the weakest member of G-Unit.
If a member is weak, then he's out of the group.
G-Unit doesn't have a weak member.
G-UNIT IS ON TOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The album is bumpin on "So Seductive" and "We Don't Give a F___" and "I Know You Don't Love Me".
If you like lyrics and G-Unit, cop this album!
I've been waiting for this album all summer!
Look at The Game.
He's out.

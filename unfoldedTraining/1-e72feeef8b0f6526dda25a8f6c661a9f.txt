SPEND THE EXTRA AT A LOCAL SHOP AND GET A QUALITY INSTRUMENT.
He plugged in the guitar and it didn't work.
All my son got for Christmas is an amp and a guitar that I couldn't even sell for parts.
I got it so he could experiment and learn.
Keep in mind too the return policy on this puppy is thirty days and if it poops out after that too bad.
Then he tried his brother's amp and it worked in that one if it was plugged in just so.
This was bought for my 12 year-old son for Christmas.
He is very musical, but didn't want to spend too much money.
After a few months use and it completely does not work.
Oh wait, they'll email you ways you could trouble shoot to fix it.
It is worth the extra money to buy a good one with a name you can trust.
I have to see it and try it out.
DON'T BUY THIS.
Christmas morning was a disappointment.
NEVER will I buy another instrument off the internet!

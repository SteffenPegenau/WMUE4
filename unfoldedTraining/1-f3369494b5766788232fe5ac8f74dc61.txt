Pathetic, meaningless songs.
If you like your Korn-metal with an odious rap husk, well, there it is."
But don't mind me, 'cause this will sell like justice for the rich.
I could give a crayon to 2 year olds and get better lyrics.
More spokes off the hub that Korn have wrought, and to a lesser extent, the Deftones, whose utter superiority to this cack is so obvious I just have to laugh.
Void of melody or talent.
Want quality metal?
"Adidas, rapping, angsty lyrics, samples, funky grooves, screaming, ad nauseum.
Stay as far away as possible from this CD.
You see, rap music is that airheaded kid that sat at back of your classroom, popular, but vacant, and damn difficult to ignore because he was so obnoxious.
Stand in line, you know the drill.
Lyrical analysis is futile though, sorta like perusing mattress tags for an iambic sonnet.
Try In Flames or Children of BOdom, just stay as far away as possible from this CD.
And laugh I will.
This is not metal, this is barely rap-core.

It has composite, "s" viedo and componet conections for dvd and such.
It also has front a.v.
I still have a fantastic picture thru my "s" video connection.
Colors are bright and well seperated and the 32' screen is just right for my room.
inputs for games or a camcorder.
I have digital cable and the picture is just so clear I really cant belive it.
Although its not high def.
Recommended.
Ive been very happy with my 563S t.v.
Quite a nice analog set.
has four pre-set modes for certin things like movies or sports.
The internal menu can be adjusted to quite a few settings and the t.v.
The remote is just a standard deal it controls two other devices.
I recomend playing movies and such through your home theater.
The design of the screen gives you the feeling that the screen is flat, especially when viewing staight on.
Although its sound settings can be adjusted.

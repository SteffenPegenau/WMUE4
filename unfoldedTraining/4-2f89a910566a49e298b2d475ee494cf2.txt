His art is fantastic.
Not to mention it is one HUGE graphic novel.Alex Ross is the man.
I repeat THE MAN.
I mean it's a great story and all.
Superman...well, is Superman as always.
I guess it pressed a nerve or two, and for that it loses a star.
As a Christian, I just don't relish in the fact that they used the book of Revelation for a basis for this story.
Definately pick it up.
Maybe not a must have, but just for the art alone I think it is worth it.
But they did not need that to make it a good one.
Nuff said.
The love triangle with him and Wonder Woman Played real well and...e'hem...the baby.
Pick it up.
That aside,absolutely everything else is top-star, two-thumbs up quality.
Once again, they really didn't need Revelation for this novel, but everything else makes it definately worth it.
Batman as always is great.

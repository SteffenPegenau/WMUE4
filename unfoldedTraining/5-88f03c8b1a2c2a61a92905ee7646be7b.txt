So far it works great.
Every time I use it there is never a problem.
The nozzle is adjustable and can spray quite a few feet away from you.
Then it got away from me and fell.
I dragged it up a hill and almost dropped it, I grabbed it by the sprayer and it did not break.
Aster talking to a few people I decided to give the Chapin 3 gallon a try.
It still works.
I knew I needed a high quality stainless sprayer.
I have been using it for a few months and it has worked flawlessly.
This is a great sprayer for someone who is rough on equipment.
Easy to pump and lock.
Still works.
I needed a sprayer for weed control.
I recommend it.
Then I left it outside for a month without clearing the spout.
A good deal.

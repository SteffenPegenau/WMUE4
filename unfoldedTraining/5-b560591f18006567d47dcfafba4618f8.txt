I have no idea.
This music is cheerful, moody, spiritual, and down to earth, all at once.
Different than King Tubby meets the Rockers, this is not a dub album.
These simple lines just float over the rhythms, sometimes copied or played off of on the piano or organ.
The rythms are solid, some of the best reggae rythms I've ever heard.
The arranging is great too, these are perfectly crafted songs, simple, yet never boring.
Augustus Pablo's playing is incredible.
How does he do it?
These are beautiful instrumentals.
The guitars chicka with that sound only found in jamaica 1972.
Hands down Augustus' best.
The drumming is tight, with the snare hitting the offbeats of the offbeats of the offbeats.
The bass is thick and heavy, pulsing through the tracks like a gorilla through the jungle.
One of the best records I've ever owned.
But thats not even the beginning of the album.

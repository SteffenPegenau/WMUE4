It took people at least a week to realize that the takeover wasn't better than ether.
Takeover had to be the most overatted diss ive ever heard.
He has to get guidance from everybody to do anything.
The song was on Cormega's album who dissed him in the song too.
Then he was lost so he turned to BIG who helped make his first album good.
It was a good diss talking about Jay-Z gangsta fakeness.
Lyrical exercise is the best song on the album and it is a bonus track.
Now he is alone and nowhere near nice as people think he is.
I decided that Nas would win.
The first thing I did when I heard Nas and Jay-Z had beef I listened to both of their first albums.
People idolize Jay-Z not realizing that he is nothing but what people make him.
Back to the album.
First it was Jaz who he left in the streets.
Why didn't he go at Cormega.
People say he tore up Prodigy on the takeover.
Thun and Kicko was Prodigy's diss at Jay-Z.

Some of these obscure 90s bands are neat.
This seems to be be a very nice find.
Singing is good.
Pretty clever album.
This one actually worked out for the better.
I was looking for Grunge era albums and happened to come across this.
Grungy, Alternative style.
The songs are not too catchy, but took me some time.
Oddball-ish bands, but gets expensive as you keep trying new bands and the trial and error.
Nice variety with some rockers and softies.
It Rocks hard, but yet some commercialness to it, kind of Soundgarden like.
Must've been a fun time for music at that time.
Guitars are edgey enough, but not too heavy.
More on the Alternative side than being too Punk.
I get excited when I find albums like this.

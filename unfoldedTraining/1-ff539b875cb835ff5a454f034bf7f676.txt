When I move the mouse up or down or right -- no problem.
The hole is so big that the ball, when pushed left, pulls away from the roller.
The ball in the mouse is too small for the hole is rests in.
I will replace it ASAP.
I finally figured out the problem.
I will no longer nurse this mouse along.
I thought it was the batteries, or the positioning from the receiver, or my mouse pad was too smooth to make the ball roll all of the time.WRONG!
I have had this keyboard/mouse combo for about three months.
Learn from my mistake.The keyboard is pretty good -- not great.
Do not waste your time or money on this trash.
What junk!I just hope I can still get a refund.
The result is no mouse movement.
Well the roller inside the mouse is on the left side of the ball.
I always had trouble with the mouse.
But what good is a wireless keyboard/mouse combo when one of the components is absolutely worthless?
But when I move the mouse to the left it doesn't work.

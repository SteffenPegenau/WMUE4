We like this show, but not all the sex.
Actors and Actresses do a terrific performance.Battlestar Galactica - Season Three
We stopped watching the show for these reasons, it is getting boring!
They spend way too much time showing this.
Beautiful photography.
As it is, it seems like it is going to tank if the writers do not stop doing all the useless sex and more on a real story.
We loved it when the producers brought in the 2nd Battlestar, but hated the fighting between the commanders.
Wonderful job, however, on the graphics.
Sorry.
Developing the stealth craft was great, it gave them an edge on the cylons.
No plot to it.
They should bring back a 2nd Battlestar and this time, have them work together to save the fleet.
We don't care about Baltar's sex life or any others.
If these writers' would focus more on this instead, they could really bring the show back.
If they would make the story more about the journey, and the fight against the cylons, it would improve the series.

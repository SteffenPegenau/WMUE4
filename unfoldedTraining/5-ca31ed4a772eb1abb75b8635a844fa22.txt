The battery also holds the charge for a long time.
I have had the vacuum for about 3 months and I am buying every woman in my family one for Christmas.LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!
The filter has held up great to repeated washings.
!
It was a little heavy feeling for about the first week, but now, I don't even notice.
I have 2 small children and I have to sweep my kitchen after every meal!
The trick to that is to turn it over.
I noticed a comment about the bristles being short so you can't sweep with it.
If I have a large job, I will sweep with it first and then vacuum.
It will sweep great then you can just suck up the pile after you are done sweeping.
The canister holds a ton so you do not have to empty it very often and I just rinse everything out in the sink every once in a while.
It is easy to turn on/off with your foot.
Using it 3 times a day, the charge lasts about a week.
The broom vac does the job perfectly!
I even use it for touch ups on the carpet.

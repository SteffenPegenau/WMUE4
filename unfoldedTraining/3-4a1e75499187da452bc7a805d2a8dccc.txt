The committee meetings were too long.
I read several hundred pages for THIS!
The end-end was sorta confusing.
Overall this is an okay book, not as tightly constructed as some of King's other works.
The ending was a real let-down.
After that, it slowed down a bit.
The darkest, most terrifying piece of fiction ever written.
Laws, yes!
What I expected: The ultimate horror novel, something that would give you nightmares as long as you read it and would haunt you for the rest of your life.
Some of the characters in here are really good.
It could use an editing job.
Beats me.
What happened?
I want horror, not politics.
It just happens so fast that you feel cheated.
What I got: The first part where Captain Tripps kills everyone off moved at a really fast pace.
Shocked me, sure, but not scared.
The ultimate story of good versus evil.
There was no part in this book that really scared me.

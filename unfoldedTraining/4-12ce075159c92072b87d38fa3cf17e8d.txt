I suppose I should order xl or xxl next time.
My third issue is a practice common among western coat designs, the sleeves are tapered at the ends with elastic cuffs.
Had the sleeves been open ended as monk or desert nomad design the air flow would dry out the internal moisture created by sweat.
The coat could then be used in heat and cold.
Clothing designers need to change this shortcoming.
I ordered a large because I like dead air space between me and my outer layer, I fit medium.
My second issue is with the size.
For me as a minimalist backpacker, this is a bit much.
With the elastic cuff design even in the cold if you exercise too much you get wet on the inside.
I wish it compacted more.
When rolled it takes up the space of a small pillow.
This coat just fits me.
That is not much room to put in between layers of clothing.
It is light weight.
The price is very nice for a jacket.

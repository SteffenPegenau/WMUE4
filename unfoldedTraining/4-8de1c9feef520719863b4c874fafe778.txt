But I did want to see what kind of writing it was.
And I admit that I brought the book because she was the author, not because of the plot or anything.
Anyways, I liked it.
I was surprised - the plot wasn't great.
I like the way she writes, but I had to re-read some of the sentances to understand them.
Nothing really that great.
12, yes, not 8.
What did I expect?
It's not going to be my all time favorite from now on, but I liked it.
I gritted my teeth as I spent that 15 dollars.
To tell you the truth - I didn't really want to.
It wasn't that original, but I didn't expect a legend.
I'm a Britney fan, not a big one but still a fan.
It's very unusally for me to read anything that was not Stephen King or Christopher Pike.
But it was good writing.
I read somehwhere that this book for orginally for 8-12 year olds.

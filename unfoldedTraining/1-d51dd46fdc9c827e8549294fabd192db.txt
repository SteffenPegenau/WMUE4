All very disappointing.
An obsession with details, clothes worn, brands of gadget, etc.
The first were alive and fresh, an adventure.
421 copies available from $0.01.
The characters are wafer thin.
The plot is too fantastical to even draw you in.
Nemo's submarine.
This is now the Mills & Boon of adventure.
The new ones are..."Oh dear.
No, no, no.
instead of eh story...In Sweden, we say 'cake on cake' - not one shipwreck, but 2, then a vintage plane fight over Manhattan, then finding lost viking boats, moored next to Cpt.
Or the Roger Moore of Bond.
I have read all the books, I like the series less and less.
Just to qualify, what is about to be said.
And an ending, to make you want to puke, it is so saccharin.
Yep.
I think someone was on autopilot writing this.

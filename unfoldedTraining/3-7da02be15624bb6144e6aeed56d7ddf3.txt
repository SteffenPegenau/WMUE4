Ron Howard directs this tale about two brothers in the same unit of the fire department as their dad was.
I like the special effects and the research of the gases and also how the fire department works.
William Baldwin does a good job as Ryan Mcaffy(The younger Brother).
Kurt Russel does a perfect job as The older Brother.
It has good points and low points.
Donald Sutherland springs his crazy philosophy of fire as a former arsonist.
Robert DeNiro brings once again is best to the story as the arson investigator.
However towards the middle and end the special effects weaken some of the acting.
I like this film.
Dir:Ron Howard.
Check out the ride at Universal studios
Althought it had a great director and a great cast.
Cast:William Baldwin Robert DeNiro Donald Sutherland Scott Glen Jennifer Jason Lee Clint Howard and Kurt Russel.
Also Clint Howard Rons younger brother appears in the intruiging film.
Scott Glenn who I think was the best in this movie,does a great job.

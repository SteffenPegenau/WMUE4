The president man movies really wernt that great.
Was he replaced?
I give this set 3 stars,only because of logans war being good.
Norris joins him and saves the day.Presidents man 2, had a diff president, a diff presidents man..no explanation why?
Who knows..These were norris's weaker roles.
Its basically a guy norris raised after his fam got killed.
His later films, he looked really bored.
See them if you must..
Im a norris fan, but those 2 movies bored me.
And his asian daughter, while hot, was really annoying and a bit**.
Kinda over the top but had alot of action.Presidents man was eh ok.. norris and his daughter get a guy out of jail, train him and he becomes the next presidents man.
Logans war was entertaining to a degree.
Was this supposed to be the same guy?
Then him and norris face off with the mob.
Esp in president 2.

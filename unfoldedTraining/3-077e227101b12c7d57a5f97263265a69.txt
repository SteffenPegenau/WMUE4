It is hard for a person without the money, fame, success, contacts, etc.
I did not know what to expect from this book.
I thought my chances of following in her footsteps quite remote.
I really enjoyed her humor.
I have rarely read a book that didn't provide me with something to think about and some wisdom to take with me.
Ms. Gilbert is obviously a very intelligent women with an amazing grasp of cultural literacy.
This book was no exception.
Saying all this, however, I did have some difficulity with the book.
What I got was mostly witty and profound.
Her struggles were real.
of Ms. Gilbert,to relate to a lot of the book.
Her spiritual tranformation was inspirational.
Some reservations aside, I would recommed this book to a friend.
Eat, Pray, Love.. was a joy to read.
Ms. Gilbert is a accomplished writer.

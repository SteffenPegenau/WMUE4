I'll definitely keep using DRY IDEA!!
I've been using it for over one week and still no itching!
That's when every few days, I alternate deodorants.
Even though it goes on ""wet"", it dries rapidly and doesn't blemish your clothes.
My clothes and my underarms are as fresh as when I got out of the shower and put the clothes on clean.
At the end of the day, no matter what kind of deodorant I've tried, my clothes either smell like the deodorant or a very slight body odor.
I definitely liked this deodorant a lot.
I didn't know if I would like the ""wetness"" or not.
Well, DRY IDEA is the best deodorant I've used in years.
Most deodorants cause me to itch.
When I first started using DRY IDEA Roll-On, I was a little leery since I had been using ""cream"" deodorants.
Well, with DRY IDEA, this didn't happen.
!
With DRY IDEA, this isn't necessary.
It kept me dry all day, even through very stressful situations.

For young readers, I reccomend more INTELLIGENT reading.
It is a lot better than the book.
Camp Greenlake would never exist in this country.
I seriously say that the movie is better than the book.
The book is also unrealistic.
Not books about some treasure that you KNOW the good guy is going to win.
I felt that I was reading a book that happened in a foreign Communist movie.
How can someone live off of peaches that have been sitting in a boat for one hundred years and only just barf?
Watch the movie, instead, which is in theaters now.
I somewhat enjoyed the book as I was reading it, but afterwards I thought "Why did I read this?"
And American justice is much better than that stated.
The book was okay, but very badly written.
Wouldn't it be a lot more serious?
Waste that same amout of money for a movie ticket.
So if you're going to waste [money] plus shipping on your book ..., don't!

cya next time
I just got this gun yesterday.
This gun is definitely worth the money.
This is one of my favorite automatic airsoft gun I have.
It is a very very good gun.
The silencer doesn't do anything except make the range worse.
VERY GOOD GUN.
Now the bad things.
It has a great fire rate and it shoots very far plus it comes with an adjustable hop up that works.
All in all it is a very good gun.
I play often.
The shipping costed a little too much.
But it was worth it because i had a war the day i got it.
I shot my friend from fifty feet away in the goggles.
The first day you get it it says to charge it for 12 hours.
It is very accurate.
This isnt for someone who just plays airsoft one month or anything like that.
I charged mine for one hour (which i know is probably bad for the gun) but it is still working on me.
The shipping said 3-5 business days but mine came in six.
Also it has a semi automatic option as well as an automatic.

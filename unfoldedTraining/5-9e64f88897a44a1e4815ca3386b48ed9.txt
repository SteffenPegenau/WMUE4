It isnt the biggest thing in the world.
It is waterproof so I did take a shower just to test it out.
And I finally got the package today and I was so excited.
I was in the shower so It wasnt really a big deal to me.
I purchased this last week.
It takes 2 AA batteries so make sure you have those.
But It is a really good size.
This is my first toy and I was excited to have it so soon.
The texture is amazing and the vibrations are great.!
But I would recommend have lube.
I used baby shampoo.
But So far I LOVE IT!
I love how you can adjust the speed to the way you like it.
However make sure you clean it with a mild soap and hot water.
I would deffinately recommend this to someone.
It only took about 5 days to get here.

if you like what you hear, get the record and you'll love it.
and...
if you don't... listen to some RAMMSTEIN.
yes, many of the songs sound the same, but if you like it, you won't care.
it's... uh, hair metal, played with lots of synth, only, much more up to date, and heavier.
after listening to this album, you're left asking yourself... what the hell?
yes, it's okay to like this.listen to the samples.
this is one odd duck.
yes, it's a parody.
sort of proves a first-time point- it's okay to bash the hell out of everything, and be HAPPY about it.
it sounds like nothing else.
how could you possibly classify this?
and certainly not "cool" by any means... but everyone has a different definition of that.
either you're going to like this, or you're going to hate it.

HAPPY?!
it's pretty weird.

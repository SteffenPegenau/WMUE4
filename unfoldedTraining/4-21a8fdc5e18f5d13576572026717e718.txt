What can you say about Morgan Freeman?
One of the best.
As good an actor as Clint Eastwood has become he has mastered the other side of the camera also.
He just doesn't make bad movies.
I did not leave the theater totally depressed.
I'd be hard pressed to think of a more misbegotten sport.
I felt the movie was about pursuing dreams, & facilatating the dreams of others when you can.
No matter.
I knew I had seen a very well made movie.
I put off seeing this movie because of the subject matter.
Not only another boxing movie, but girl boxing.
It's about taking chances, opening youself up to different options, the ability to adapt & change.
He just gives great narration.
Boxing's not the point, (it rarely is) it's merely the vehicle.
A solid four.
I don't see Hillary Swank as a movie star, just a damn fine actress.

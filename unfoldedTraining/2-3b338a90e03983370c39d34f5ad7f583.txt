The maid,Elsie had no business killing innocent MPs.
She did try to talk to her husband.
He did try to talk to her.
She CHOSE to starve herself to get her way and force her husband to change.
Very childish.
Naomi should have known when she married Garnet that he was older and a rigid,fixed person and bringing about radical change to him would be something he didn't want.
Both dealt with the problem in very immature ways.
Now,here's the problem.
He CHOSE to lock her in her room to get his way.
What happened to her was a tragedy.
They chose not to compromise.
She's an adult.
I read this book and my opinion of it is the following:yes,Sir Garnet Royce had no business locking his wife in her room, that's false imprisonment and against the law.
Now,Naomi has every right to believe what religion she wants.
They are both stubborn and set in their ways.

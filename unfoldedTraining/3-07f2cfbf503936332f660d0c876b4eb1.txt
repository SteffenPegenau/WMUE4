The second one I read was confusing as heck.
I can't recall which King (Bachman) book I read first, The Regulators or Desperation.
I wish I had.
If you like King, you should enjoy them.
I just wouldn't recommend reading both.
The story is the same, the characters names are all the same, but now their characteristics are all different.
Stick to one or the other, and you should be happy.
I couldn't seem to keep track of what was going on because I kept trying to reference the first book.
Not sure why King took this tack for these books.
The first one I read was good, interesting and a lot of action.
Overall, each one is a fun King story.
A hero in the first book could be the bad guy in the second book.
I would give the first one I read 4 stars and the second one 2 stars, so they average 3.
Strange.
It's like King took all the characters, put them in a blender, and came out with the new book.

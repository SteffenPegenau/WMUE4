The simple yet always melodic guitar leads of Andy Taylor bring us back again to vintage Duran.
All five members are back together again and this is their first album toghether in a long time.
Well, Duran Duran is finally back again!
Yes, studio technology and recording today can do amazing things for vocalists but the voice is still a voice and Simon Le Bon's sounds as young and fresh as in the 80's.
Roger Taylor is back drumming in the style that we loved so much in the 80's.
Great stuff!
And as always Nick Rhodes works his magic on the electronic side of things adding fresh new techno type riffs to the whole mix.
This CD has something for everyone and easily crossovers into a variety of genres.
The complex and melodic bass lines of John Taylor are so great to hear again.
Thats right.
Wow!
Amazing.
Simons voice sounds as good as it ever did!
The songs are a mix of their original style and that of the 90's.
Four stars.

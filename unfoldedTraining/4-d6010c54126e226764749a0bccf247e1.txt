Some people trash sequels and some people feel that some sequels are better than the original.
I always enjoy the chase between Doctor Loomis and Michael.I will always be partial to the original, because it was just that, "ORIGINAL".
A plot?
It always interests me on how people's tastes differ.
He's strong, silent and destructive.
It brings back "The Main Man" Michael Myers and his Doctor Sam Loomis(Donald Pleasance).Michael is back for more terror in Haddonfield.
I am not one of those people.
Especially on sequels.
I do, however, feel that Halloween 4 is well worth seeing.
Just replace Laurie Strode with her niece.
However, Halloween 4 is a good sequel.
Michael is always an entertaining sight and a great killer.
This time hunting down his niece.
Well if you've seen the first 2 then you already know the plot.
As I looked over some of my movie reviews I saw that on my review of Halloween 3, some people found it helpful and some people just didn't agree with me.

I decided I might beat the odds.
there is problems with overflow-but if you use less it does not cover the whole grid.
but if you're really excited, and have always wanted one-pick another!
I finally got it right (sort of).
browning is great.
The description stated that the top was heavy so there would be no'lifting'.
I should have spent more and purchased a belgium waffle maker instead.
so if you need one, yeah the price is right.
I settled and although I am not completely disappointed, I am neither quite thrilled.
this waffle maker did not get the best reviews.
well, the batter did push up on the lid everytime.
timing is perfect.
the second waffle came out better.
i reas many reviews on this and other waffle makers.
I chose cuisinart because of the name and the price was good.
It was okay.
it is just there.
the first waffle got stuck and I had to peel it off piece by piece (I had not used spray-even though instructions said it was not necessary).

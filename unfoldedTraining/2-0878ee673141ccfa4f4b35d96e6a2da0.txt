!BUT--Less than a week after I received this machine the knob on top for frothing the milk melted!
Then, less than two months after I began using it, it simply stopped working.
It would not heat up.
Tasted Great!!
So I now have a $250 paperweight sitting on my garage floor.Get something else.
But the post the knob sits still on got very very hot and I suspected this would have happened again, so I took the knob off until just before I needed to froth.
That sort of worked.Okay, so that was an annoying problem.
The inside threads stripped and I had to use a wrench to turn the frother off.
The heating element burned out.
But the mfr.
told me I left it on too long and that's why it burned out and they would not fix it.
Great coffee, but very unreliable.
I assume my earlier melted-knob problem might have been caused by the heating element over-heating and that's why it burned itself out.
After several weeks they did send a (free)replacement.
Got this, set it up, made espresso.

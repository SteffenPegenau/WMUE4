Um.
I haven't actually awaited a release since BOC's "Club Ninja."
Other than to say that, at times, it sounds kinda like some throwaway alternative from the late 80's.Gone are the wonderful riffs, melodious hooks and edgy vocals.
First song rocks.
It's about frogs.
What a wonderful album.
Not a weak song on it.
Boring.
Well, as with that musical fiasco from '86, Nonpoint's latest really disappoints.Let's discuss "Statement."
That's about it.
Uh.
I was so excited about this release that I almost wet myself when the 25th actually did roll around.
If you don't, buy it instead.Now let's discuss "Development."
My head's hung as low as the average beats per minute on this album...
If you already own it, you know what I'm talking about.
Gone is any singing in Spanish.
Gone is anything with any real punch.
Er.
I can't believe it.
Gone is any interest.

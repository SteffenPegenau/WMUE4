OK, so I'm not a book artist, but I am a journal-keeper.
and you'll find yourself!
I was hoping for real journal information--idea development--and what I found was slick, finished pages that took HOURS of time.
but there are no rules!41 contributing artists.
Heck, if you're going to put that much work into a journal, why not sell?
and this other thing!
And if you have that much time to put into a journal AND make art for sale, you have a WHOLE lot more time than I do.It's a pretty book.
Lots of tricks, no process.
Lots of eye candy.
and this!
Could it be that a lot more artistic men are making art to sell, while the women are making journals?
How come?
A bit bouncy in the text--try this!
and this!
Six men (by name analysis; could be fewer).

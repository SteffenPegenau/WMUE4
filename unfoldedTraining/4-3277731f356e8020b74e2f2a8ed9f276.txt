Yes, I have some newer and older stuff.
I know you'll read this if printed on this site.
I cut my teeth on Oak Ridge Gospel.
I want a cd remake of the "Street Gospel" album.
Didn't think we remembered, huh ?
Is Hermann Harper still alive?
I like the songs still.
Respectfully submitted, and thanks.
I like it all but won't buy any more country cds.
Get off the money wagon, Oaks you've made enough.
Bury the hatchet, guys.
They're good at country but will never be as good as when they were gospel.
These songs were recorded when the Oaks were in transition from gospel to country.
Get back to your roots.
They belong in gospel and they know it, every one of them.
Maybe Bill Gaither can help you guys get it back together.
Give it a shot.
How about an old gospel reunion with Willie Wynn, Little Stevie Sanders, et al.

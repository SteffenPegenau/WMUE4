Third the trimmer advertises you may turn it around and use it as an edger.
This occurred every time I tried it as an edger.
So I thought the battery was the answer.
Second the cover around the head is too small.
I had to stop, take off the line spool, fish out the line and start over.
Well you can turn it around but forget edging with it.
Every time I attempted this the line broke off inside the head.
This one is too heavy.
Last it is underpowered.
This trimmer is not balanced, you carry all the weight.
I used it for about 30 minutes.
It did keep running but would bog down when attempting to cut a moderately thick patch of grass.
WRONG.
The gas motor is heavy but is well balanced.
If you are looking for a replacement for a gas trimmer, this is not the one.
I decided I did not want to drag a cord around anymore but I did not want to worry about a gas engine.

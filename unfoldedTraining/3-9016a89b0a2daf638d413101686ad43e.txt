My husband and I have been trying to have a baby for some time now.
We were ECSTATIC.
After seeing all of the positive reviews I wanted to try this product.
The cycle of hope continues.
I didn't ovulate this time.
Hoping to get pregnant soon.
I used to have extremely painful cycles and I wasn't ovulating.
I started taking FB in January 2011.
I am undecided on whether I will continue this product or not.
Being hopeful, I kept taking them.
I was for the 1st time on a regular cycle and not to mention they were very easy have.
I immediately saw a difference in my cycle.
However, I still wasn't ovulating.
A lot different from being stuck in the bathroom sick for 2 days.
In August 2011, I had my 1st positive ovulation test.
I ovulated every month after that until this month (January 2012).

It is way too fat.
This line was crossed with this product.
If you are looking for something simply to hold your collection in a drawer in your studio, this might work well for you.
I will not be using it.
I'd buy from them again.
I would be super weary about this when you use coated filters (i.e.

This thing barely fit in my mailbox.
There's a line between safe filters and not being able to fit your filter wallet in your bag.

HMC, etc).
Oh well.
As for the seller, AvidMax, they did good and shipped my item immediately.
Also, the plastic windows contain some sort of "mesh" on the inside that could rub onthe glass of your filter.

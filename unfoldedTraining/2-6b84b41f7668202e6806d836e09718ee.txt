Finally, the author did a poor job developing the characters of the enlisted men and NCOs.Lastly, unlike his other books I've read, there really was no "tiering" of the drama.
Similarly, Nathan Dixon's character got old quickly(tho' a bit less quickly).

I didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as his earlier books.
In previous books, we would have been privy to the happenings at Fort Apache and we would've been with Seargeant Taylor when his Bradley Fighting Vehicles were attacked.
Personally, While I could identify with both protagonists, I tired of their characters early on.
The author's coverage of Reider's internal struggles (new second lieutenants are filled with self-doubt.
went on.

This book, much like the soldiers of 3rd Platoon, rambled along in the fog (as I write this review, I wonder if that was the point).Bottom line: if you like military fiction, it is worth a checkout from public library.
.and on.
.shocker!!)

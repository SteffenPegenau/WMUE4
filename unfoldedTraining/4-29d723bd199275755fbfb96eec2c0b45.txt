.
I would recomend this to any Star Wars fan, young or old.
Being an avid Star Wars fan, I've spent most of my free time reading and re-reading this book.
But if you are familiar with SW, Hang On!!
.
But, as Han would say, "Hey, its Me!"
I love it!
.
..(Maybe I stayed up longer than I thought reading it.
Well, that dashing,daring, and devoius Han Solo has done it again.
More excitement, more adventure!
sleepy.
Now, I will admit it, there are a few parts in there where I felt kind of.
uh.
.
You're on for a pretty wild ride.
I tried to get multiple opinions in this book by my friends, and it seems that if you don't know a lick about Star Wars, you probably won't understand some of this book.
. )
All in all, I would say this is a very good book.Some might say Han is just to brave (or to stupid) to be realistic.
but the abundance of action and suspence quickly banish it away.

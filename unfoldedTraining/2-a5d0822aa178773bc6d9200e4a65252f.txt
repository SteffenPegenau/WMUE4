Yes, I know how to use stainless... yes, I know how to use proper heat for the diameter of the pan--this thing is just well--crap.
The handle seems to be heavier than the pot!
In all of my other cuisinart pots it takes maybe 5, 8 if I start from really cold water.
I was not expecting this.
I ordered this pot to help fill the gap in sizes.
I was expecting something of the same quality.
First of all--as another reviewer commented--it tips.
I also own a Lot of Cuisinart pans in this Classic line.
I will have to keep this pot in the back of the stack.
It is so thin... it took 25 minutes to boil water for macaroni.
Maybe the husband can find a use when he makes sauce for smoking or something... but then again--it tips!
First of all--I cook a lot.
This pan let me down so much!
I hate giving this review because I ADORE Cuisinart pans... but you let me down on the quality here.
I have three other 3 and 4 qt pots and use them all the time.

Maybe it was some girls who saw her play a few years ago opening for the Strokes or Kings of Leon?
This is the sort of audience that you get for Bjork or Joanna Newsom.
She sounds really good.
Not a weak moment on here.
I saw Regina Spektor play recently in Los Angeles.
Anyway I have seen her play a few times now, and the audiences are getting bigger and more enthusiastic.
Everyone is quiet and on the edge of their seats.
It was at the El Rey Theater.
The first album was quirky and sort of fit in with the anti-folk thing.
They hang on to every word.
It's a better-produced record.
This sounds like a hit for anyone else.
This record is a more planned out thing.
There are some really poppy songs like "Better."
There was an excitement in the air, which you imagine there was for the Beatles.
Regina Spektor has a lot of young female fans.
Even Nick Valensi of the Strokes appears on a song.
It was sold out.
This record has more experience behind it, and Regina has grown up a little bit.

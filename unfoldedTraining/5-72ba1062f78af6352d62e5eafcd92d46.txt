But the endings are much better in this one than in the previous version.
Spider-man is a lot of fun to play.
I hope Mutant Academy 3 will be on Playstation 2.
This game seems to have corrected almost all of them.
One thing I noticed with Mutant Academy 2 is the volume in the ending sequences.
And this game has secret characters such as Spider-man which is GREAT!
It seems to drop a bit for some reason.
The first game's graphics were good for Playstation 1 standards.
To play him just press L1 and select Cyclops to play.
You'll automatically be Spider-man.
I have the first game and it has a LOT of flaws.
Looking at it, the graphics are exactly the same as the first game.
I was disappointed that this game wasn't.
The biggest flaw the first game had was the gameplay which is completely corrected in this game.
I read the reviews of this game and they were not good.
But I gave it a try and I am very pleased with the results.
But that's not necessarily a bad thing.

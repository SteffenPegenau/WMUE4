Ms. Winslow.
What a follow up to Life, Love and Loneliness.
In her pockets!!
I loved it.
Continued success!!!
Give the author her props the right way.
Ms. Winslow, this book was worth the wait.
Please write a sequel to The Criss Cross there are still so many unanswered questions.
I wanted it to go on forever.
I have recommended this to so many people and every one loved the first one when they read it.
I was very dissapointed when I finished the book.
Big ups!!
I read Criss Cross in 2 days what a great book.
No sharing!!
I will definitely recommend The Criss Cross also, But they have to get their own.

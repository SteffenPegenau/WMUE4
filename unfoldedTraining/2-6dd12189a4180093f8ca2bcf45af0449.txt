NO PIZZA PHONE?!
All of the live action sequences DESTROYED!
No Captain Lou?
All of Captain Lou Albano's liquor induced hysteria GONE!
Beautifully wretched and disgusting cartoons, but not worth their own DVD.
No guy who played Luigi?
Trust this review, this DVD is not what it claims to be.
Not in sorrow, not in pain, but for all of those who will never experience the glorious divinity that is Lou Albano stumbling durring a scripted sequence.
NEVER have I been so depressed over a DVD.
No Winny Cooper as abandoned orphan girl?
NOOOOOOO!!!!
You kings of entertainment.....rosebud
And worst of all......no Do The Mario.
OH IT STINGS!...
"So now I cry.
!I'm not swinging my arms from side to side...and it stings!
Good night, you princes of television.
8 Colmplete episodes?
Only if by complete you mean "not complete.
...for a DVD of nothing but terrible cartoons.

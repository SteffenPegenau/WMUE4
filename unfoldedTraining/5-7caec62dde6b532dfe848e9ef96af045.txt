Just about as long as an episode would be if you had to read it.
The "Drunken Aeryn" scene was one of my favorites.
Take THAT, Babylon 5!
Viva Liantac indeed.
(Apologies to all B-5 fans).
Well worth the purchase price.
I never get tired of Johnny-Boy saving the day.
This was the fastest I have ever plowed through a book.
I can definitely say that we can all be safe in the knowledge that greatness has returned to televison series-based novels.
This book had all the humor, witty remarks, cool creatures and fabulous Crichton one-liners inherent in the tv series itself.
Ohhhh man, this book was great!
Farscape, the most wonderful and excellent sci-fi television series now has a most excellent and wonderful book series!
199 pages was the perfect length too.
Just like the tv series I am certain that these new book additions will never let me down.
5 hours.
Of course, this is the first series-based novel I've read since Quantum Leap.
Viva Liantac, everyone!

Andie MacDowell is cute and charming as well.
On top of the poor video quality, the sound was just as awful.
Hugh Grant is charming and funny in a clumsy way.
I have watched a lot of DVDs in the past year and this was one of the worst.
A new video transfer, a new audio 5.1 channel mix and some extras would have made this a top DVD.
The volume was very low, and jumpy at times.
Too Bad, Its a Great Movie.
This was a very good movie.
Instead MGM decided to skip all the goodies technology has to offer to keep the price of this DVD down.
The dialog at times didn't come through clearly and there was no use of the surround channels.
The cast as a whole is terrific.
This movie could use a thorough update to the entire pakage.
I felt like I was watching a VHS tape.
I know the English are pale, but this DVD transfer did not do them any justice.
The picture was very bland and the colors were muted.
I recommend this movie to all.
The DVD on the other hand, was very poor.

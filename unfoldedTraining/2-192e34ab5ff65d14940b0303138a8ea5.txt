I'm trying to save you a few bucks here.
It's a bad book, trust me!
People then proceed to accuse my review of being not helpful.
I already wrote one review advising people not to buy the book.
I explained why.
Don't spend money on this crap.
It's not supposed to help decide TO buy the book, but NOT TO buy the book.
The only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 is that the final segment was somewhat charming.
The book reads like an *average* high schoolers creative writing assignment.
He still has some maturing to do as a writer.
Look and see how many others wrote the same thing I did!
The writing is bad, the characters are boring, the story is trite.
If you MUST read it, check it out from the library.
It is the second-worst book I ever read.
Are only positive reviews helpful ones?
You want to read some good southern literature - read Lee Smith, Pat Conroy, Fred Chappell, numerous others.
Stay away from Nicholas Sparks.

But anyway Anthrax has been Nu-thrax ever since they got John Bush.
Anthrax only has 3 good albums, Fistful of metal, Spreading the disease, and Among the living.
Their bassist Frank Bella realized how bad they were sucking, so he decided to quit.
haha.
Anthrax is just worthless.
I don't know what Dave Mustaine is doing with Megadeth, he might just do some kinda dumb solo album.
I really can't believe people actually like this weak music.
They need to just quit and die for good.
None of them can play anymore, it's just all jumpriffs that any band could play.
Slayer is the only band of the "big four" that still plays metal.
And just for the record, all Nu-metal is for sissy little girls and f@gs.
In other words, Anthrax has sucked now for about 17 years.
John Bush is one of the worst vocalists ever.
Long live Death.
When they fired Joey belladona, they killed themselves for good.
Whoa, thats longer than Nu-tallica has sucked.

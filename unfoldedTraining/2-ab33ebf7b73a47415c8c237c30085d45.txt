Whoever thought of them must be turning over in his grave (or rising from it!).
I am extremely tolerant of these horror films, (I couldn't help but like deep rising) but this was just old.
This vampire thing is completely outdone.
O.K.
Watch it twice.
It wasn't that funny.
2.5.What I tell my friends is, "Its about a whorehouse full of vampires.
Except for the guy who was high.
It could have been a lot better.
O.K.
My advice?
Don't get me wrong.
Its not a bad movie.
But, still, reflecting upon it, It was just unoriginal and repetative.
Its much more enjoyable and funny the second time of viewing.
2 stars is underrating it though.
Its nice to watch on a friday night with friends.
Big Deal" See it for yourself and make up your own mind.

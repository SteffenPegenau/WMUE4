Greatly.
Please!!!
If anyone from disney reads this--PICK ANOTHER FAIRY TALE!!!
There's lots out there that haven't been disneytized.
I probably will and it probably won't be terribly stupid as some sequels are, but this pains me.
Cinderella two was not the greatest disney sequel.
Why should any of them get a 3?
Make something new and original again.
Parents, babysitters, and teachers who have to watch these things beg you!
China--like Mulan--good movie.
So yeah, I haven't seen this movie.
!
The Little Mermaid 2 and Mulan 2 were both better.
So why is it that this one get's a 3?
Rapunzel, Rumpelstiltzkin, and then there are the ones from other coutnries that western europe and Grimm and stuff.

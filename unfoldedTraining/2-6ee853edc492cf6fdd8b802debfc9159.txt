), I installed it anyway.
Put it back together.
It leaked.
Still leaks.
First, according to the documentation that came with it, this filter only removes about 50 percent of the chlorine in tap water, and it does not remove any chlorine byproducts at all.
There are more effective products out there.
Put it back together.
The O-ring that fits on either end of the little barrel filter had not seated properly.
Water all over the place.
Took it down, took it apart.
Don't bother with this filter, if for no other reason than it's not very good at what it claims to do.
Thinking that any filter is better that no filter (usually applied to pitcher filters, etc.
Then the other day, turned on the shower, heard a pop, and it leaks again.
No leak for two months.
It's going into the trash.
I have one in my other place.
Took it down.
Took it apart.

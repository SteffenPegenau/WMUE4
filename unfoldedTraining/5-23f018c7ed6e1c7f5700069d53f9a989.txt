REMOVED THEM WITH RUBBER SPATULA.
FOR NOW THE AUNT JEMINA PANCAKE AND WAFFLE COMPLETE MIX WILL DO SINCE I HAVE 2 BIG BOXES TO USE.
MAYBE SOME PEOPLE WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT DRIPPING FROM THE SIDE DIDN'T ADD OIL AND THE MIX WAS TOO WATERY.
DON'T THINK I WILL BE MAKING TOO MANY PANCAKES NOW.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO EXPERIMENTING WITH OTHER MIXES AND RECIPES(MINI CHOCOLATE CHIPS, YUM).
CLEAN UP IS EASY WITH A PAPER TOWEL BUT I ALSO USED A Q-TIP TO CLEAN IN BETWEEN.
I USED THE 3&4 SETTING AND BOTH TURNED OUT FINE.
I OILED IT BEFORE FIRST USE AND USED PAM AFTER THAT FOR EACH 1/2 CUP OF MIXTURE.
I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH SPILLAGE OR STICKING.
I TRIED IT AND THE WAFFLES TURNED OUT FINE.
I USED AUNT JEMIMA COMPLETE PANCAKE MIX BECAUSE THERE IS A RECIPE FOR WAFFLES.
I GOT THIS ON SALE IN A DEPT STORE.
MY SON TASTED THEM AND LIKE THEM WITHOUT EVEN PUTTING ON SYRUP!
OTHER REVIEWERS SAY NOT TO USE A PANCAKE MIX.
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THE ADDED OIL.

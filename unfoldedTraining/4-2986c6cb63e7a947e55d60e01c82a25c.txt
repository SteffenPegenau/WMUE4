That was just as bad as the LSD screen was.
and now I feel bad.
So dont buy this get the offcial one.
I was so sad because my mom payed $[item price]for it and wasted her money.
So I got an exchange and the stupid junk screen still didnt work.
I was so excited when I got it.
I got this screen for christmas.
I was so mad.
Your company is the worst I ever saw in my life...
You make horrible things.
and I hope Intec company learns how to make things.
I worked good at first and then the second day it broke.
oh yeah after the exchange it broke again.
Thanks for nothing Intec.
just yestarday I actually got the Intec Dance mat.
If Intec reads this I want to say to them, You people put no effort in your work.

I enjoyed these books and have enjoyed the first couple for ages.
An active content table of contents would have helped make it more convenient to read the series broken up.
the poor man spends novels trying to GET a cup of tea!
Good read.
.
So, why not five stars?
And that is the wonderful thing about the books in this series .
they're not typical sci fi and they rather poke fun at the whole genre.
Still funny, though.
First thing, its a lot of Hitchiking to digest at once.
I am NOT big into science fiction.
.
.
Also, if you read the material at the begining of the wrk, you'll realize that writing these wasn't really super fun for the author, which is why the last two books have the feel of being tossed out quickly, with little enthusiasm, and a lot of "FINE, HERE!"
.
And it isn't Arthur Dent's either .
It just isn't my cup of tea.

I really enjoyed watching this anime.
There a lot of interesting characters in this anime.
Glass Fleet is the story Michel and Cleo trying to free the galaxy from the tyranny of the empire.
It's a unique anime series and there aren't too many other series that are all that similar.
It's kinda like star wars.
There is a good mix of action and drama.
As I said the characters are the best part of Glass Fleet.
It's not a bad price either.
Overall Glass Fleet is a solid anime.
If Darth Vader were gay and had braids there wouldn't be much difference.
I'd say that my only complaint is the sick little pervert that always follows Vetti, the bad guy, around everywhere.
Glass Fleet will probably be a good addition to your collection.
The bad guy is so bad that you'll wanna fight him yourself, and the heroes will make you wanna strap up and go to bat with them.
He's pretty sickening.
The most impressive aspects of this anime are the animation quality and the space battles.

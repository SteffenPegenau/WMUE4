she could have let him go but instead decided to chase him down and swallow him whole while he's still alive.
She then removes the gum from her mouth and turns back into a human and has a relieved look on her face like she just did something good!
After knocking out one of the guards, she eats the other one!
Very stupid, inept film.
She then makes a comment about how this alien form 'Looks good for her hair'.
Tasteless, boring and stupid.
Bad acting.
tries to be funny but just wasn't.
The various creatures&monsters; looked fairly good, I guess.
I only remember one scene:A girl and a boy are being arrested, both protagonists, and in order to ivade this, the girl eats some martain gum which turns her into a giant green monster.
So what are the redeaming factors?
some cool creature effects, I guess.
man!
What a horrbile fait!
and she doesn't feel bad she just digested a innocent man and turned him into feces!
Is that a moral they want to teach kids?pitiful movie.

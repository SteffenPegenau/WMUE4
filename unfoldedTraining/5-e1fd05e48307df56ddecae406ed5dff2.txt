All of the tunes are.
Same with Killing Me Softly, it's tear jerking beauty.
THE best piano music on the planet, period.
I'm always ecstatic to find his music, especially since he's not readily available.
Sealed With A Kiss is played to perfection, with lush strings, light percussion and great piano playing.
Very romantic but also relaxing.
Tonight is quite different from other arrangements, yet it's still true to the song.
Out of all the many pianists out there, he stands out; in a class all his own.
!
These cds were well worth the wait.
Although the listing shows it as various artists, it's actually played by pianist Carl Doy.
Put these cds on and suddenly all the badness in the world seems to go away.
He plays so wonderfully beautiful!
The arrangements are perfect, from the first track on disc 1 to the last track on disc 4.
Wow, these are amazing!
He really knows how to get beauty out of a piece.
Wonderful!Thank you Amazon for having his music!!!!

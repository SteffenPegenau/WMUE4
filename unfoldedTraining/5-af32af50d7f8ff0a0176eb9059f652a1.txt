Enjoy.
It starts you off with a fun rollercoaster ride with reality saving Marvel characters.
The stories through out the series are well developed and are a fun read.
This series adds a 3rd degree to it, it accomlishes that same answer to a lot of those "what if's" and then gives it an ongoing reality.
or whatever .
What If's like what would happen if the Brood survived or if the legacy virus mutated or this villain took over or if this person wasn't exposed to gamma rays .
and then it answers those questions and keeps those stories alive and mixes in all the other realities to create a whole universe of ongoing answered what if questions with their own specific and weird reality.
And it gets complex.
I have read the whole series.
:)
They remain true with their continuity and sub-plots through out the storylines.

:)P.s.
This is the first graphic novel in the series.
If you can remember the "What If" series that Marvel had out a very very long time ago.

Didn't sync well at all or it did partially.
Not a single problem with that.
I went online only to see what experience others had.
After reading several not-so-flattering blogs from others trying to find a way for this thing to work, I finally found a way to solve my problem.
I think we both felt better as both of us were out of our misery.
I agree that the Zune has a good look about it, though a bit heavy and thick (as others have mentioned).
Stay clear of anything Microsoft.
No more problem.
It was in a funny way very therapeutic.
I went to the workshop and took out a hammer and applied it to the Zune.
I went and got an iPod Classic.
I'm now a convert to Apple.
I tried using the software that came with it, downloaded the upgrade of the software.
As a well-seasoned Microsoft user (now Vista) I decided to use Windows Media Player (as it said on the MP panel).
After being very excited about that initially ... that didn't work either.

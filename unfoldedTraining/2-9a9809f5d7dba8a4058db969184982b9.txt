Some of the beats are good on the cd , but 50 cent does not rhyme clear to me.
Thisfake rapper wont be around along.
Not a Hip Hop legend here.
I could not understand why there are pictures of guns on the inside cover.
That is nuthin to be proud of.
Who gives a rats fanny if you were shot 9 times.
This sucka mc talking about murdering people is a disgrace.
Total garbage as far as content.
Nice image for the kids talking about shooting people , and someone licking your lolipop!
There is nuthin new or fresh on this cd.
Let the code of the steets take care of itself.
This cd is ok.
I used the insert to wrap my fish!
No growth as an artist.The rap community does not need this negative type of music.
A lot of his words are bunched together.

Some might say Kris-when writing these songs-lost touch with other things, due to the fact that many(if not all) these songs relate to girls.
It's all heartfelt and endearing.
Well the core things.
It never manages to lose a grasp on reality.
As I write this review "End Is Forever" has been released and while a far better album it just shows how much progress and headroom these guys have to move up.
Sonically, it's well done, but a little bland.
It's a choice he made and a well fleshed out execution.
There are few people I can call my heroes.
Fantastic album.
I think it's a sin attaching a pedal to a guitar, but variety is the spice of life.
Lyrically the album is astounding.
Must buy.
The cd is reminiscent of all the things that make up life.
Kris Roe is god.
He's one of them.
His style of emoting the lyrics comes through wonderfully and he keeps a sense of humor through out.
Along with Mark Hoppus, Benicio Del Toro and Julius Caesar.

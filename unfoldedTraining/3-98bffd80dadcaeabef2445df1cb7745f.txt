MINIMALIST JEWELRY.
So, anything I wear has to be subtle in design and modest in scale.
I like jewelry, but I practically never wear it.
Men with big, sinewey hands with large knuckles and serpentine veins can wear jewelry pretty easily, and it looks good on them.
There's a very discreet hinge and fastening device.This is something that might appeal to and be suitable for a MOMA kind of guy.

)This is the only bangle I've bought and worn in thirty or more years.
Very light, but doesn't look it.
Not small, mine are musician's or surgeon's hands, perhaps.
My hands have tapering fingers, and my wrists are unobtrusive.

We don't use the flash light as hammer, do we?
What I heard was that LED lights are very bright and efficient.
It uses 3 AA batteries and it's heavy.
!
It has got just 3 LED bulbs (instead of 5 in hummer) and just one AA battery (instead of 3 in hummer).
Surprise..!!!
Thought I'll try my luck a little more.
But what a disappointment!!!!
It turned out to be very bright... so bright that when I tried first time, it was pointed to my face and I couldn't see anything for sometime.
Now I'm thinking, why I bought the hummer instead of this one!!!
It's not as bright as I expected it to be.
It has a rugged design, but what I need is, it to be very bright.
I bought it as a present for my father.
After buying this I changed my opinion about LED flash lights.
But when I saw a different type of LED flash light in Walmart, I became curious.

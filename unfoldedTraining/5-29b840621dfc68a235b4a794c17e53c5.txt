The Velvet Underground's third album is their softest album to be released.
VU didn't release a bad song.
It is just a fact.
And Some Kinda Love has those kinky lyrics that are like Sister Ray and Femme Fatale.
Pale Blue Eyes is one of their best ballads.
Buy This album.
Every Song Is Incredible.
It is also one of their best.
This album shows that they could be incredible and influential without Cale.
Although John Cale is a musical genius, Reed is also.
The Murder Mystery is still a great song.
This album doesn't have quite the mainstream sound as Loaded, but it is close.
Besides The Murder Mystery, all the songs are commercially accesible.
Songs like What Goes On and Beginning to See The Light show that they can really rock.
I'm not saying that is good or bad.

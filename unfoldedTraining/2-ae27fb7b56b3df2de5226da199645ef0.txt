Since the retailer will replace the game, not refund it, I got GAME #2.
Return--replace.
By now, I have a clue, I did GAME #4 in the store.
So, I bought the game and played it for about 4 days and had a blast with it on a long car trip.
GAME #6 played once, wouldn't restart.
So I took the game back.
Replace.
GAME #2 played once, then wouldn't restart.
GAME #5 played for 5 minutes, then restarted 5 times.
Just a black screen.
I went to the car, restarted it and black screen of death AGAIN.
The store had no more games, so the manager agreed to refund my money.Obviously, there is a problem.
GAME #4 played 1 time, then wouldn't restart.
Return--replace.
GAME #3 played for about 10 minutes, restarted 3 times, then died.
Brought it home and the next day, it wouldn't restart.

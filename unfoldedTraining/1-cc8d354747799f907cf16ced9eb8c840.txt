I even read the reviews about the leaks, but because there were so few, I thought it was just a fluke.
Other people will tell you that it is all in how you twist the top on--not so much!
My husband and baby were soaked every night while attempting to bond.
Who has time to turn a top just right?
You can't twist too tight or too loose with this thing.
They don't just sprinkle, they poor.
I bought the Dr. Brown's wide mouth bottles instead and they have been wonderful!!!!
Do not buy AVENT!!
!
I want to be able to just get it ready quickly and feed my crying infant!
Wrong!
No special mechanics because they make their bottles for people who need ease!
They leak-- a lot.
As a breastfeeding mom, I wanted to provide my son with an easy transition to bottle (for when I pumped).
I purchased AVENT after reading the reviews on all the baby product websites.

Put them together and the whole deal has to be worth 3 stars.
C'mon, it's a cheap camera (more like a battery operated usb stick with a lens).
Sure, they weren't flash but they were there.
There were all the pictures!
We bought one ages ago and forgot we had it.
Software, definitely a 3.
Cut it some slack.
Just prior to a recent holiday in Vanuatu I pulled it out and threw it into the bag with some batteries, just in case, not expecting much.
Used it there, no problem, watertight, brought it home, plugged it into my Mac - nothing.
But then I noticed the 'enhance' function on the loaded software.
My slightly washed out pics were suddenly vibrant and full of the colour that the real underwater world had had.
Brilliant!
So I loaded up the provided software onto my aged and wheezing PC desktop, connected the camera and lo!
So, camera, probably a 2.
Not even recognition that something was in the usb port.

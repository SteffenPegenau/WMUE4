The spinning Hepa filter gets jammed with dirt/hair and stops spinning.
At first, it was great.
After about 2-3 months, the problems started.
When I do get to talk to someone, they are NOT helpful.
Without suction, its worthless.I have had this vacuum in the repairshop 6 times for this same problem.
What a crock....Several times, I have called Hoover's main number in Ohio to complain.
The last time I was in, repair shop told me that I need to use another vacuum to clean this one out periodically.
Am I supposed to borrow my neighbor's vacuum to clean mine?
I have had Hoovers all my life (this is my 4th Hoover).
They only tell me to take the thing to the local service center.
Unfortunately, my warranty is about to run out.
After this experience, I will NEVER buy one again.
Thankfully there is a 12 month warranty so I havent had to pay to get it repaired.
I bought this vacuum 11 months ago.
Then it packs full of dirt and loses suction.

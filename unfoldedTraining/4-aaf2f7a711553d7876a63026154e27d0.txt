The purpose of this club was to create chaos to civilization.
They caused a lot of damage to the world.
He meets a girl at one of the group meetings that he goes to for his insomnia.
People saw them fighting so they started fighting for the same reason.
I thought this book was very profound.
They went to a bar for a couple of drinks, and when they came out, Tyler told the guy to hit him as hard as he could.
It showed me that life isn't about living without regrets.
It is about a man who has insomnia.
You have to take chances to live a real life.
It becomes Project Mayhem.
After you read up to this point, it just gets better, and you'll never want to put the book down.
It has had an impact on my life.
Later, the fight club turns into something more than that.
That's how fight club started.
That is the best part of the book.
They started fighting for no other reason but to let out anger.
Project Mayhem, was spreading.
Then, he met a man named Tyler Durden.

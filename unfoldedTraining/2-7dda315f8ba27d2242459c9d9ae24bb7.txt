You'd think I'd be listening to this album all day long.
All of the songs are great.
I wrote a review of this album when it first came out.
The down side is they are not great enough for me to want to listen to them.
I now have to reduce that rating to 2 stars.
But they're just not for me.
I gave it 5 stars then.
I think I've listened to the album a total of 5 times.
But I just can't get into any of these songs.
They sound good.
LeAnn is my 3rd all time favorite singer.
Sorry LeAnn.
I like all of the songs on this album except for the dreadful song "Twisted Angel."
And most of those times I forced myself to listen to it.
I'm a little conflicted.

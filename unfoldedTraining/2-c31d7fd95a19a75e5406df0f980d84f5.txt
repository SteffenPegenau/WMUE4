And the pastor.
I was just disappointed at the end.
At some parts it just dragged on.
And I hated the ending.
It left you hanging.
I need more.
Also if you read the back of the DVD cover its like it tells you the story.
He looks like he was on drugs.
I liked the story line of the movie alot, but I just couldn't get over how the actors act.
I liked warriors alot better.
Yes we all know that he is going to start following the right path but come on now.
and it just ends.
lol.
Ok, his girl is on drugs and she gets to the hospital never tells you who calls the hospital or what.
Does she get better do they get back together.
MAN I DONT KNOW YOU TELL ME.
I just felt liek they could have done something more w/ the story line.
WHO KILLED LIL BOY!!!!!!!!!
I dont know It just didnt do anything for me.

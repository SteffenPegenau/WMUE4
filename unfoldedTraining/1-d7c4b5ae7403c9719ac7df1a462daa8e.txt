i was wrong.
maybe my cats are too lazy but i doubt it.
my cats are trying to get teh treats out and they wont come out!
its just one more toy to add to my cats bag that they never play with.
because of the recording device in it the treats dont fall out easily at all.
however, my 4 cats did NOT like this toy.
the recording device was easy to use.
the ball itself seems pretty well made.
the recorder piece that snaps into the ball makes the weight of the ball fall onto one side making the treats harder to get out.
i think the problem is that the ball doesnt roll easy because of the recorder.
so they all pretty much gave up.
i even tried to use smaller treats but they are really hard to get out.
when it comes to food they are reallly persistant.
at first, the hole where the treats fall out of looks too big and i thought the treats would fall out too easy.
i had to pick it up and shake the ball to get one treat out.

BUT..
Then, they discovered the clear window feeder.
**Update** It has now been almost 8 months since I bought the feeder.
...
I ended up buying another standard feeder for finches that hangs from the eaves.
I love the feeder- it hangs well on the window- its not an eye sore- the suction cups are strong.
So far, its been up for 4 weeks with no luck.
:( I've tried a few different seeds to no avail.
It holds a nice amount of seed.
I have yet to see a single bird come and eat!
I'm really disappointed, but we'll keep trying.
It is great to finally see birds feeding from the window feeder.
I've noticed, much larger birds come to the window feeder, than the finch feeder.
They all drive our cat crazy and the kids are fascinated by the continuous stream of birds who come to socialize and feed at our front window.
Within a month, flocks of birds were at the newer feeder.

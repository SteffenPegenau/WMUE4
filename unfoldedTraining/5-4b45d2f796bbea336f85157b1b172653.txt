I used the fitness cd daily.
Did I do anything about it?
First with the stationary bike, than with just dancing.
The answer to these questions were all YES!!.
By getting the CD by Eric Wilson called Fitness Rhythms I actually looked forward to getting into shape, being more flexable and getting away from the TV.
It worked for me.
Did I need motivation?
Did I need to get more flexable?
The answer is yes!!
Different from other CD's it actually takes you from warm-up to full throttle, and than back again.
I even lost a few pounds which were "icing on the cake".
I look forward to the next Wilson CD.
Did I need to get into shape?
Did I need to get off the couch and move?
I would put it on and start my exercise.

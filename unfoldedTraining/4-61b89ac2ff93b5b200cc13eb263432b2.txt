Wow!
(comes with extra speaker, wireless remote control, and something else) But it costs $399 on logitech.com So if you get it.
I use to be an Altec Lansing fan until I got the Logitech Z-640 sound system.
The subwoofer is 188watts of pure fun (not for the neighborhood) and the speakers are 53watts of clear sound.
Don't look around any longer.
The only sound system better than this is the Z-680 5.1 THX certified sound system!
That sound system was great but I had to upgrade.
In other words it is approved for movie blasting!
This sound system is excellent!
Get your sound system TODAY!!!
This is better than the bose sound system mainly because it produces the same sound but doesn't cost $2000.00 No, just divide that by a 10 and you'll get your price!This is also THX certified.
So I got this one.Wow again!
(I'm limited to 1,000 words)
HAHAHA!!!
Buy it from amazon.I could go on and on about this system but I can't.

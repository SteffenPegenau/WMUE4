I purchased this camera this summer for $150.
This is my 2nd Kodak digital camera.
I tried the long exposure taking pics at the pool during the evening.
I have not tried all of the camera functions yet.
I heard that it was being discontinued.
I don't use the video much.
Those turned out very nice also.
My first one took great pics, so I did not hesitate to buy the 643 model.
For some reason, this camera dropped in price during the summer.
I use a 1 GB memory card which will hold 4,000 pics at 1024x768 resolution.
I highly recommend this camera for less than $150.
I took this camera to Ft. Walton, Florida and it took pictures with fantastic color.
My camcorder has Steady Shot to eliminate this.
Any vibration in your hands(s) will show up in the video.
The menu system is easy to navigate through.

I played this until 50th level.
There are supposed be massive guild wars for control.
Or starting up alts.
This is one of the big probs in the game.
With only one guild in control, theres no interguild fighting.
It creates another chokepoint for powerful guilds to maintain control.What ends up happening is the PvP is so uncommon, that most players end up sitting around farming xp, just to have something to do.
I was fortunate in that my server had not yet reached stagnancy.
There are, but eventually they end when a guild wins.
Or if it is, it's very lopsided.
Just to have something to do.
No PvP.
And then everything gets very booooring.
The classes are well designed.
I think making the disciplines a droppable, stealable item, instead of a questable item was a big mistake.
Because they can't PvP.

Just recently I heard a song on the radio called What's Golden.
And I think that I hear 4 different people rapping on this album.
They aren't all bout sex, drugs, and money.
But forget that.
But as usual they didn't say who it was by.
If there wasn't music I'd die!
Thanks to the two DJs backing Jurassic 5.
I'm obsessed with hip hop.
They about giving a good message.
One thing I don't get is the group is called Jurassic 5....but on the back of the CD case, they show [6] people.
Jurassic 5 is a must have.
Turns out its by Jurassic 5!
If you like old school, good old fashioned rappers, then I'd say get this CD.
I only gave the CD 4 stars because it wasn't the BEST.
The beats were awesome!
Music is my life!
I'm real glad I was listening to the radio at that time.
So I might have missed something, but that's a little confusing.
So I had to go online and find out.
The rhymes were pretty good.

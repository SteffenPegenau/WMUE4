Which team is that?
Is there a MoA?
The Los Angeles Nationals?
Near the bottom, the MON really confuses me.
I have the Kindle Fire and I am reading the book on the Fire.
It's a pretty important part of this book in particular which has lots of charts.
Also the charts with the mysterious team abbreviations are annoying.
The third team is LAN.
I don't know if this is a Fire issue or the book issue.I have a page showing the most consistent teams since 1993.
Is that St. Louis?
Which team is FLO?Other reviewers have said enough about the book I just want to point on the flaws on the Fire.
The 6th team is the NYA.
Some of the graphs are small and there seems to be no way to enlarge them.
What is ANA?
The New York Angels?I guess that is the N and A mean National vs American league team, so A means Yankees and N means Dodgers in my example.

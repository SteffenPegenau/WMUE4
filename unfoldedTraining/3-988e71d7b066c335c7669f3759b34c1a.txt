The other 7 are blah blah blah!
Be careful with buying this cd!
That is 7 of the 14 songs.
On some of those songs, they sound like they are wining and it bugged me to no end!
It is an awesome song!
Read my review of that.
I love good music but the 7 other tracks are not good.
The other good songs on the album are THE LONG GOODBYE, WHEN SHE'S GONE SHE'S GONE, UNLOVED, EVERY RIVER and SEE JANE DANCE and AIN'T NOTHING 'BOUT YOU.
I will skip those songs and probably never listen to them again.
Thanks!
I have waited with reservations for this new album by Brooks and Dunn.
The standout song is GO WEST!!!!
This album has some good tracks and the rest are just filler.
Since their Greatest Hits album was released, they have gone downhill and it seems not at a slow pace.
Simple as That.
If you want a great new cd, go buy LORRIE MORGAN AND SAMMY KERHSAW'S I FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE!

Sits on my counter top with no difficulty.
I like the ease of it.
I also like the drip stop feature of the spout.
but now I have got the hang of it.
I use it 2-3 times a week.Some people don't like the size of it but I don't care.
Cut oranges in 1/2 ..juicing takes less than a min for a glass..and cleaning takes about 2-3 mins.
No problem at all.
I like the dust cap feature as well.
I don't like store bought OJ so this was a must for me.
Every thing is good, performance, clean up etc.Every now and then I throw the plates etc in dishwasher.
Initially I had difficulty putting up the upper cone.
Only reason I would take the half star is for its price.If you can afford that price and you like orange juice you MUST have this.
I have it for almost a year now.
I would give it 4.5 but there is no way to do so.
I am more than happy if the device performs well and if cleaning and maintenance is not big of a deal.

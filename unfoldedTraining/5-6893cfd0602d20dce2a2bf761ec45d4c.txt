I know next time I'll do even better.
I could still move.
The production quality is excellent.
I really enjoyed it.
The setting was very relaxing, even in the studio.
This was just right because it wasn't too strenuous.
It is really wonderful to still be able to do some form of light exercise when you just don't feel all that great.
Scott has a very low-key manner about him.
I like working out one-on-one with Scott.
He is calm and encouraging.
I like that in an instructor.
I had a little trouble with some of the moves, but nothing too difficult.
He is very motivating.
But I still wanted to do something to move my body.
This is an excellent addition to a regular exercise library.
I did this workout today because I had a headache and I didn't feel like doing any of my step aerobics or low-impact aerobics workouts.

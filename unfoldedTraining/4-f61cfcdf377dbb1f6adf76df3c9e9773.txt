perfect for a Friday night.
"No Strings Attached" is a really good CD.
i thought this was a totally stupid song but now it's kind of fun.
"Just Got Paid"- a great party song.
it's totally funky and it's a great dance song.
"Space Cowboy"- this one took a little getting used to.
"It Makes Me Ill"- this is the bomb!
I'll review some of my fave tracks.
"It's Gonna Be Me"- this is an awesome song.
a good slow song to be a single.Those are a few of my fave tracks.
i love everything about it, the lyrics, the beat.
"This I Promise You" - a pretty nice song.
It's an overall good CD
it's totally awesome.
i also like the effects on Justin's voice.

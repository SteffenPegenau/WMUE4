But after getting the album, I soon came to realise that "Highly Evolved" really had nothing else.
You Am I, Grinspoon, Jebediah, The Living End, Powderfinger just to name a few.
After hearing "Get Free" & "Highly Evolved" I don't blame the world for going nuts!
These two songs are really good and I love them.
The other songs were OK, but sound weak & bland compared to the first two singles.And then I saw these guys live at the big day out 2003 (large australian music festival).
That guy is a wanker.
So many good Australian bands around.
the vines were absolutly terrible!
as an australian I find this quite insulting.
They sounded weak and were easily the worst band of the day.
They seriously need to work on their live performance.
Why does the world pick The Vines to love?
Oh my god!
Listen to some real music.
And whats the deal with Craig Nicolls accent?

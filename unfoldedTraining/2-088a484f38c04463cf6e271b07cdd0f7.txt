What's up with that.
I've read a lot of the other books past this one and I have to say the best are #51 and #70-72.
What the heck is going on?
(It's a great book by the way.)
Just to let you know I haven' actully read this book but i've skimmed through it.
I mean she's the one who got got me interested in eventing.
Most of the books past this one have just gone downhill.
I loved Christina but now she's only ok.What's the deal with Parker suddenly joing series.
I love the thoroghbreed books but a lot of them could be better.
Don't you agree?
Oh I have to say that thy shouldn't have ended the book #72 like they did.
I loved these books.
All of a sudden Dylan is not mentioned anymore.
I think they they should have had Christina stick with eventing and have Melanie do the racing.
Why isen't she doing eventing?
And then in the next few books Christina turns into a racing fanatic.

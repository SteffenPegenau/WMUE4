FOcus by kashmir is a tight song.
3 stars cause there r some weak songs.
Follow me gangster is another track you cant skip, no matter what.
for eg.
This soundtrack is real cool and most of the songs i cant skip.
just cause eminem is in it doesn't make it stupid.
and i like the vocals.those r da songs i like.
is not the kind like dmx, but in this song he did good.
they all did their best.
WHAT'S IT ALL FOR and DO SOMTHIN' i mean comeon.
specially the chorus.
50 did his best.Stomp da s**t out is also a good track but i don't know why they put MOP in there.
this is first time i heard Kashmir.
others are kind of weak.but it doesn't make it a weak soundtrack.buy it if you have your faovourite rappers in it.
Go to sleep desrve better what it is getting.
X gonn' give it to ya is a perfect opening.
i know, em.
Song is cool and nice beat.

Poorly written, and VERY poorly edited.
I hope she does not write another novel using Sayers' characters.
Bunter would never be that familar with Ruddle.
Trust me, I'm a fan!"
I read then and know them!
It is full of allusions to moments from other books, as if Walsh is trying to say "See?
The scene in which Harriet puts an exhausted Bunter to bed would NEVER happen that way; Harriet wouldn't violate the social contract.
The book has more dialogue and less intelligent introspection and analysis than any Sayers book.
Looks like a rush job.
It is a disservice to the fans.
But Sayers hardly ever repeated herself.
In a late scene, Bunter appears in two places at once.
This book does not honor the Sayers canon.
Trapp is not likely to tolerate Ruddle.
There is no attempt to use dialect or idiom to distinguish people from different backgrounds.

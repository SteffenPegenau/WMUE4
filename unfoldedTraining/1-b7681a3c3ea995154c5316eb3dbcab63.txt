India, of course.
It is March 10 and a bug they (finally) acknowledged in February is still not fixed and apparently never will be.
Don't get me stated.
Because they are experts in US tax law.It is time to move on to another product.
Horrible.
Turbo Tax is now relegated to the status of being a formally good product.
To say that this version is a disappointment is an understatement.
Support?
Run, do not walk, away from it.
The interface?
It deserves zero stars.Bug ridden, terrible interface, no support.
Nothing important, just the program not applying deductions to your return raising your tax payment.
Let's not mince words, this product is garbage.
I have used Turbo Tax for many years.
You know, minor stuff.

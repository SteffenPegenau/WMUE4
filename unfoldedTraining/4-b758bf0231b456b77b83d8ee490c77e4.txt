I guess I misread the product details.
.
.
I'm happy with mine and I hope the ones I bought as gifts will be enjoyed by their recepients .
When it is described as being a 1.5-inch digital keyframe that reference is to the overall dimensions of the body of the unit, so do expect a smaller viewing area than 1.5-inch.
.
The quality of the screen image is good.
I was disappointed with the size of the screen.
.
So that is one thing to consider.
I haven't had much time to see how this product looks after being in service as a keychain carried in a pocket for a while.
Its possible the screen may get scratched up some from rubbing against other pocket contents.
Still the image size is such that it shows a good picture.
This seems like a good product.
The software that is supplied to transfer digital images to the unit is easy to use and works well .

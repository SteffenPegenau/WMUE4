You read and read and read and NOTHING happens!
The result here is way too much conversation and not nearly enough action.
However with this book he has fallen prey to what so many series writers do, the need to recap too much from past books into the current book.
I was so hooked-finally.
Even Cara's adventure is a small letdown because everything just goes back to words afterwards.
No more pages!I finally get really vested in the story and it's over.
I really hope the next book jumps back to the old standards.I hate to see the series just fizzle out.
it's worth 9.00 credit at the bookstore.
I want to say first I really love Goodkind.
I will have to really think before buying the next hardcover in the series.I know I won't be keeping this one.
it was over.
However the last part of the book, WOW!
But then bam!
Bottom line-this book wasn't worth waiting for the ending.
When you finally think something is going to happen it's over in like 2 pages, no big deal.

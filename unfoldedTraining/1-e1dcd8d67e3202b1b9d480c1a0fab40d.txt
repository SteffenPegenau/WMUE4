This movie is horrible on many levels.
(No.)
Did your agent read the script?
...FAIL.
I must ask: Jason Statham did you read the script?
Did anyone read the script?
(No.)
Didn't think so.
With good reason, the critics have not been very kind to Crank 2: High Voltage.
Final analysis: mindless script filled with filth, soft porn, and little action (in comparison to Statham's other films), remotely entertaining, contributes virtually nothing to Jason Statham's body of work or the film industry.
Did your manager read the script?
(No.)
In addition, it could not pass for a made-for-tv film.
Its caliber is so low that it called for an amateur actor, not a mid-career or veteran actor.
(No).

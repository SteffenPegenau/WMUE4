But , I find myself staring at the grainy picture.....
I cant even bear to watch it all.
I own about 20 DVD movies.
They ought to be ashamed to have released this garbage transfer.
Really, listen to us all....
One word= GRAINY.
I have a 27 inch Sony TV with S-video.
My other DVDs look WONDERFULLY CLEAR.
This DVD collection from HBO is unacceptable!
you will be sorry!
We all buy DVD for one reason: crisp clear pictures.
I am curious to know if the VHS of this is clear.
I cant even stand to finish the first episode.
I have old VHS that looks better than this... even recording at EP mode on a VHS looks more clear than this.
SKIP THIS!
I love the Sex... series alot..

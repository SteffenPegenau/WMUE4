I like their harmonies once in a while, but the highs don't fit.
Until now, I've loved every album by the Peppers.
They turned pop.
That's about it.
What happened?
The only song they should play on tour is "By the Way".
Frusciante and Flea sing way too many harmonies.
The Peppers used to be badass in your face rock and funk.
It's a sad thing.
The funk is gone.
I am the biggest fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Maybe I'm not used to their new style, but I think this album is very sad.
I never thought I'd be disappointed by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
I'm just hoping they treat this album like One Hot Minute on their tour.
I saw them with Foo Fighters a couple years ago, and over any other concert I'ver ever seen, that was the best.
I love the song "By the Way" on this album.
This CD is packed with soft rock and One Hot Minute-style Peppers.
I even like One Hot Minute.

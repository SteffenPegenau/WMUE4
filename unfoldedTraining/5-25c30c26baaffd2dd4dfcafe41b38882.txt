They'll tell you, too!
So if you like The Sixth Sense you should see this, too.
This movie was also scary, but it didn't gross you out by showing tons of blood and guts.
See it.
It's awesome!
This movie is about (of course) signs appearing in crop fields.
But since that isn't really long enough to be a good review, I'll write more.
It is a great movie, I highly reccomend it, so go see it.
Yeah, it gets to be more, but I won't say who or what is causing the signs.
This is a movie that also deals with family relationships, not just the freaky things going on in the world.
See the movie, then you'll know.
Signs was written and directed by M. Night Shymalan who wrote and directed The Sixth Sense, another one of the best movies ever!
That's it.
Also, the acting was really good (very believable).
Both movies are very, very awesome.
Or read other reviews.
Signs is a great movie.

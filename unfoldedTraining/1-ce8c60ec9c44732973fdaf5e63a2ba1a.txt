What's happened to him in the few short years as a performer is even more shocking.
Unfortunately in this concert he is neither.
A good voice gone bad.
I loved Josh Groban in the beginning.
Groban has become pimped by the Music Industry.
What a turn of events.
He had a great opportunity to do a second concert that was as great as the first.
It's a darned shame!
He was one powerful singer.
Even with thousands of screaming fans present, with all the dazzle, Groban was just plain dull.
Wow!
This one is just an un-doing.
Groban was never a true all-around entertainer.
It is just disappointing that he caved in to the empty-eggheads to become the male version of Mariah Carey.
Period.
He was shockingly talented and that voice!!
The energy is in the audience, not in Groban's own singing or the total performance.

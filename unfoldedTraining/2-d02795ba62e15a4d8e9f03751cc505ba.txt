Guaranteed to give you a good night's rest.
But skip it anyway.
The film is terrible to look at, cheaply made, terrible actors, and not scary.
Maybe I should have given it three stars for that?
This was boring.
Except for Ed Gein, but even that was 40 years ago.
Believe me, I was born in Wisconsin, there ain't nothing going on up there worth making a DVD about.
I would have given it one star, but it was well researched, so I'm giving it two stars.
Wait until you read more reviews from sane people about what they think of it.
This film did put me to sleep, so I'm grateful for that.
Only one review for this DVD and they called it a 'masterpiece'.
I should have known.
I want my money back!
What was I thinking??
Never trust a film that has only one review with five stars.

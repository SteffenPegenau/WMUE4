The multiplayer's been a source of a lot of fun too.
Another problem is the police.
Still a great game overall.
4 is basically all urban NYC.
And unlike all the PS2 Gta games, there is no cheat to turn police off.
Would def recommend
Sometimes they can be very overwhelming.
It'll keep entering you into games with 1 or 2 people when you'd prefer a game with 16.
Your just entered into games at random.
Why not?
Where as SA had plenty of different terrains.
And that can be annoying if there's not a lot of people online.
And there isn't as varied exploration as in GTA SA.
How hard could it be to allow a simple cheat?
Really have enjoyed this game over the passed couple years.
Single player has givin' me hours of fun whether i'm following the story and completing missions or just roaming the city acting like a maniac.
My main complaints about the multiplayer is there is no main lobby to search for open games.

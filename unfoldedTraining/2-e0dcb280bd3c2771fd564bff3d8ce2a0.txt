Never buy from 'Got Books Inc'.
Ridiculous!
Honestly, what the H*** is taking so long?!
Really lousy.
Still haven't gotten the d*** thing.
It was shipped via domestic standard shipping.
I didn't need it on Valentines Day, so I wasn't to concerned when it hadn't showed up for our celebration, but now its almost March, and I still haven't gotten it.
Ok I'm done.
THIS REVIEW DOES NOT MEAN THE PRODUCT IS BAD, ONLY THE SHIPPING WAS A NIGHTMARE!
I've ordered things from CHINA that have gotten here quicker.
The email I got said 4-21 business days shipping?!
What are you shipping it via camel?
This thing shipped on the 8th of Feb, its now the 29th and I still haven't got it.
CHINA!!!
Sorry to lower the rating on this product people, but if this is what I have to go through to get the thing then I can't help myself.By the way, this was supposed to be a Valentines Day present for my Girlfriend.
I can't even track my shipments.

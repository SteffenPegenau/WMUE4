And that's my point on that.
It definatley deserves 5 starts
This is the best book on the topic of programing directX windows games.
Yeah, WINDOWS!!!
Yes, he uses wrapper functions, but he tells you how DirectX works and how to program for it before he gives you the Wrappers.
And this is a pretty funny book to.
Ok, that wasn't very nice.
He doesn't talk like a text book.
Anyway, his style isn't like Vulcan, for a rock writing.
I will recommend this book till I'm blue in the face.
He talks like a cool guy, in which he is, I've talked to him quite a few times.
So why don't you go off in the corner and cry You DOS IDIOT!
I'm sorry.
Simply the best, better than all the rest.
I tell yah, that space_ant guy is a wierdo.
This is a great book.

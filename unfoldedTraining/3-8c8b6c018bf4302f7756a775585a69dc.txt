Up until the end.
Lets hope the next Twilghlight movie.
This movie should have had more action and fight scenes in it.
Well thugh.
I rented this movie last night.
Her little girl victim character started to get on my nerves.
When she knew what she was marrying into.
That is how this movie portrayed Bella.
That she isn't so victim like anymore.
The honeymoon scenes were romantic.
What I didn't like about this movie was about the talking.
I know, it's just a movie.
When Bella dies and turns into a vampire.
But, certain parts of the movie were just boring.
The movie portrayed Bella as this innocent victim in the marriage.
So many young women think marriage is apples and icecream.
Oh I am pregnant, and the baby is killing me and breaking my bones.

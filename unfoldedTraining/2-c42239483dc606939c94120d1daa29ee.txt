The main front cover has already broken and will no longer stay on.
Instructions said you could put a 12 volt battery in it (instead of the 8 volt that comes with it)but when we do this the front covers won't shut tight.
We are getting ready to purchase a kids ATV and we will definitely buy a power wheels because they are made to last.
Our 2 children have used them for 3 summers with absolutely no problems.
Rides it every day!
We have had it for 3 weeks.
Even though my son loves it - it is made poorly!
This tractor will not last!
He loves it!
Don't waste your money!
When our son backs up, the tractor runs the trailer over.
We have bought power wheel products in the past.
The trailer cracked when we put things in it.
But it is not well made.
The tailgate won't stay shut.
I will not buy any more products from the company that made this tractor.
We got this tractor for our 3 year old son.

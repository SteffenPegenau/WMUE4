Endless sounds .
dial into the reverse delay and you feel like Jimi!The only bad reviews Ive read are by people that dont even own it(I think they just bitchy too) My only complaint is that I dont have hours and hours of free time to truly delve into this pedal .

.
.Ive had 0 problems so far.So in my humble opinion, anyone that likes delay and has 225$ to spend should buy this .
.but thats not Line Sixs' problem.The construction seems really solid .
4.5 stars.
Ive had it for about 2 weeks and its starting to interfere with my personal life.
.you will not be dissapointed.
.
Super quiet when plugged in thanks to true bypass.
Any free moment I have all I want to do is go play with my new toy.I cant say if the dl4 sounds exactly like the products its trying to emulate(never owned an echoplex, space echo, etc) but I can say it sounds GREAT.
If you are a fan of the delay sound buy this product.

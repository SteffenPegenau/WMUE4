Any other kid probally couldn't do that.
I did not think it was the best.
All in all, the book kept my interest.
He does some things like untying the knot at Cobble's Corner.
He does a lot of things that you don't see every day.
Otherwise, I liked the book.
I thought the book had suspense but it wasn't that exciting.
I would recommend this book to kids who enjoy fiction stories.
One thing I disliked is that Maniac isn't like a normal kid.
If he did, he wouldn't have gone to all the other places he went to.
One more thing that I liked is how Maniac didn't stay with the Beale's at first.
I liked that Maniac traveled from one place to another.
I learned that both the Beale's and Pickwell's are both kind,caring and loving.
For example, many people think of him as a hero.
The book would have been pretty boring if had stayed with the Beale's.
I learned some positive and negative things about each family.
I thought Maniac Magee was an okay book.

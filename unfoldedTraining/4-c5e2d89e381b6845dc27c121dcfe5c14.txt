This "woman" that's in charge of the company is apparently part of the future resistance, and is an ally.
A character like her wasn't really all that important to the main story.
Zeiracorp is looking for the machine called the Turk.
In this 2nd season, we are introduced to some new characters.
I hope they decide to continue this show.
The story does progress a little bit in this season, but not as much as I would have liked.
This season also seemed to drag a little bit at times.
Season 2 ends at a very interesting and critical event.
I think fans of the 1st season will probably agree.
Riley was focused on too much I think.
The issue I have with this season is the ending.
John also meets a girl named Riley.
Overall I really enjoyed season 2.
She did serve an important purpose, but she wasn't worth spending the time that they did on her.
He spends more and more time with her, in doing so he alienates Cameron and Sarah.
There is a machine posing as a technology corp. CEO.

it ws also painful to watch the beating cena took from hbk.
this mania had lame matches like the kane - khali and the wwe womens match.
last wm the same shtick.
it was taker.
this was meant 2 b the last match.
so manyh wrestlers left out.
so many watches that should've been added but no... wwe had to waste so much time in the battle of the rich bastards.
as far as im concerned the main event is aobut the winner of the royal rumble.
specially cryme tyme.
come on.
did hhh win the royal rumble?
i mean come on.
why in the hell did they have the taker - tista match SO early.
come on wwe... smackdown deserves respect.also this mania can't b compared to the greatness of wm22.
no, it was mysterio.
don't get me wrong... im a chain gang member but cena got his butt kicked big time.
did hbk win the rumble?
i am tired of the disrespect shown to smack down.
cena vs hhh.
NOPE.

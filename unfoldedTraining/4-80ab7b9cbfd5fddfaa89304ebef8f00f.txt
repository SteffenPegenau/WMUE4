The Three Stooges selling cigarettes.
Some (especially the early color ones) are nearly unwatchable.
Okay, I made a big mistake with this set.
I sat down and watched all 16 hours (!)
Ads I'd forgotten and ads I've never seen before.
More celebrities than I've ever seen on one dvd.Good ads, bad ads, funny ads.
The cigarette category was especially bad in this regard.The good stuff though...WOW!!!
The Flintstones selling cigarettes.
Not smart.
Maybe an hour a day would have been better.
And at a better price.Highly recommended for tv history buffs or fans or just people wanting a reminder of a less frantic time.
I was amazed with this collection.I've only seen 2 other collections of commercials on DVD and this set blew those out of the water.
But the gems outweigh the chaff.
in a day and a half.
Or something.When you get multiple ads for the same product, they do get redundant.
But I couldn't stop myself.Obviously the quality varies.
A (very) young Peter Boyle.

AND a review!!
And its the 75th Anniversary Edition!
About the book - well its just plain silly.
That said, you need to know some British history to enjoy much of the silliness, some of which I do, but not really enough.
One EVENING - and I still have time for baseball!!
You can also spot the influences on future humor of Monty Python and even Shrek.
.
But we historians can appreciate that its HISTORICALLY SILLY!
Not one day.
.
Ok I got this because its a classic.
However, if you read fast, imagine a British narrator - its pretty darn funny.
If you care!
But you don't really need the hardcover, other than it's nice and firm.
I must say its probably the quickest hardcover read I've ever accomplished.

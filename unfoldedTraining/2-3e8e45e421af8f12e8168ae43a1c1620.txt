Most folks who take the time to review a record do so because they are big fans therefore, most reviews are biased on the positive side.
Snow was my first Spock's purchase.
I bought it because so many rated it high.
I really like Neal Morse.
I'm glad I kept trying.
It's not 'all that'.
I think "Day for Night" and "The Light" follow close behind.
I find "V" to be the finest overall.
This is a Spock's Beard fan telling it more the way it is - or trying to balance the scale.
First off, I really like this band.
Although I have not heard a lot of the post-Neal Beard and I have not heard the Darkness, this ranks as next to worst of what I have heard.
I am often disillusioned because there is not enough frank reviews on Amazon.
I think that is a joke.
The thing that bugs me is that so many people call this release their best effort.
I was a little disappointed at the time.

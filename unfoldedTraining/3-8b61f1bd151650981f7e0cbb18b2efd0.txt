I've always liked cats,(probably because I've had a cat,)but I recently wanted a pug.
I enjoyed nintendogs for about a week.
I was really starting to hate the thing because I had little free time, and I had to spend it taking care of the dog for what seemed to be hours.
With school and all, I barely had time to even feed the dog.
I'm glad I deleted my file.
If you want a pet that badly, buy a fish.
I finally decided I would get rid of the dog.I felt bad, even though it's not real.
Now that annoying dog is not bothering me anymore.
It's doesn't do much, but it won't drive you mad.
Now I know why.
I really liked this game when I first got it.
Little did I know, Fred,the little black pug, would drive me crazy.
The graphics were great, and the pugs were so cute!
Yes, it's that bad.
I got this game because I couldn't get a real pug.
Keep yourself from going insane.
I began to wish I could bring myself to delete the thing, but it was so cute, I couldn't do it.

Good stuff from some good guys.
All that keyboard is lost by very dull acoustic tracks.
I like it.
So calling this cd a masterpiece probably isnt a good idea.
There both on Sub Pop Records.
Pick it up if you like synth pop.
Calling it a worthy cd to listen to is a good idea.
Slow songs come on.
So is "So Says I."
Ok.
go check it out.
But anyways its The Shins I should be talking about, so here we go.
I just wrote a review for the new Polyphonic Spree cd.
The Shins sound so much like Hot Hot Heat it is kina weird.
So if you like pop rock keyboard driven songs here you go.
But then when you think this cd is a masterpiece, it slowly falls apart.
Dont get me wrong the songs are good but not as good as the first half of the cd.
Kissing The Lipless is a great track.
Actually all of the first half of the cd is great.

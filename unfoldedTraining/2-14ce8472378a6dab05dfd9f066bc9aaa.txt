If it's fake then sell it as a "faux" leather.
The 8 did fit good (other reviews wrote that the shoe runs small).
Soooo not true.
The inside of the top of the sandal even has written "made in Brazil" and "leather upper".
I'll be sending these back or selling them at a yard sale.
I loved the way these sandals looked so I ordered them right away.
Could'nt wait to get them and was happy when I tried them on.
I gave this shoe 2 stars because I know that it won't stretch and mold to my foot like real leather would.
But to be decieved is unfair to the consumer.
I typically wear a 7-7 1/2.
This makes me feel leary.
I read the other reviews and decided to order the 8.
Extremely dissapointed!
Some people would buy it anyway for the price.
Also I'm dissapointed because this is blatent false representation of a decent brand.
On better inspection I realized that these sandals are not real leather!

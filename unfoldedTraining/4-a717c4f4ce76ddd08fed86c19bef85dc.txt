It's OK. And then turn it up a little more...
As close to analog as you can get with digital.
Granted, the songs are merely platforms for the instruments.
The singing's not spectacular.
What puzzles me is the amount of negative reviews here for this disc.
You can turn this up without the neighbors calling the cops.
Either someone's got a grudge against a band member or they're so used to digital ear-bleed masterings that this smooth, luxurious mastering job by a guy named Brad Vance isn't fast-food enough for them.
Turn this mother up.
It sounds that good.
Wait til you hear that bassist.
They all sound like they were written by the same person.
If you have a decent system, give this a try.
I guess not too many people like real-sounding recordings anymore.
But these guys can play.
Vance brings out the clang of the Rickenbachers and the snap of the tambourines.
It sounds like he and the band are in the same room as you.

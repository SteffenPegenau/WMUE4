Overall I feel I didnt get my moneys worth considering that two months later and im already troubleshooting problems.
Desperately needs a current playlist to add songs on the fly.
Purchased early january.
I get an annoying, file format not supported.
Adding costume album art creates, file format not supported, and no play.
The video recorder/playback is cool, works fine for me.
Love the video features.
A lot of features still unavailable.
Being able to connect to the tv is great.
It takes eight seconds to load a song once selected.
I have all current firmware/application updates.
I use it with a brand new dell.
Mp3 features lack a few things.
The photos were cool until it lost the ability to read jpeg(i still see the photo but it doesnt fit the screen).
Mp3s play ok but you dont get the ability to search for another song while listening to the current selection.
Did like the photo features.

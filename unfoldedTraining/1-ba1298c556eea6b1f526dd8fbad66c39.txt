Ugh!
A better score is pirates of the carrabein.
this movie and stuff is so overrated.
Most songs are surrounded around hedwigs theme, and are basically hedwigs theme played in different instruments, and at a different speed.
I hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate harry potter.
The movie was bad.
Harry potter is the worst thing that came upon the human race.
It is alot better than this trash.
I dont own it, but i hear it being played by a sibling.
This score is garbage, the music has absolutley no beat, and no tune.
People just say that it is better than it actually is.
How can anyone like harry potter music.
The music is just overrated.
It is so dumb, children books, for dumb children.
I hate this cd.

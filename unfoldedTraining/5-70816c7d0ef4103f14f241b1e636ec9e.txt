Oh, my goodness.
Anyway, all my friends who saw this movie and all the reviews I read said that this movie was terrible.
Also, this DVD comes out on my birthday.
This is by far his best movie ever (Happy Gilmore is his second best).
If you like Adam Sandler, then this movie is for you.
Can't wait!
It is warm and witty and has the voice talents of so many people from Adam Sandler's SNL days.
If you don't like Adam Sandler this movie is still for you.
I say forget those reviews because this movie is simply amazing.
Ever since the film came out in theaters, I checked amazon.com every day to find out when it would be released and now, I know.
You can count on me being there at the store before school buying this.
Classic movie.
This is a must buy for any Sandler fan.
That is cool.
To all of you reading out there, I have been waiting for this movie's release date for almost a whole year.

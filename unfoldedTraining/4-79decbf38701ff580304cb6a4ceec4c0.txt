They are all intellectual literary piece.
From all the people, he should be the one to know that she's innocent.Patricia Gaffney's works are superb!
This book shows enough emotions that a betrayed woman would surely have.
After loving him so much.
I might have kill the man who had taken everything from me, betrayed and mistrusted me.
Lily loves him despite of everything he had done to her - that was before her wedding-to-be to her cousin then was sabotage by Devlin,lout.He wanted her to pay and suffer.
That is why I love her works.
Yes.
I was glad that she continued to live despite of everything bad that had had happened to her life.
I sometimes love angsty works and she gave a good one!
The nerve of that bastard!
She remained strong.
In one seating as I read it, I firstly cried when he offered money for the "service" of her body.
Poor Lily - innocent as a lamb.
I wish I have the same courage.

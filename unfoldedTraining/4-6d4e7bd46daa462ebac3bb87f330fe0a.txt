They really serve no purpose.
Truthfully, I find sororities and fraternities useless.
The last story was the best and the acting was good.
I cheered for the girl that killed all of them.
!
And they don't want anyone that's not up to their standards.
Holly was great as the mean head sorority sister.
This movie contains 3 short horror stories.
I really hate that.
I think anyone should be able to join, regardless of the name.
Down with evil sororities!
I don't really understand all the hype about sororities and wanting to join and be like them.
The undead crew and the fading actress was the creepiest but I don't really think Bridget is meant to be an actress.
But who was the killer?I wasn't expecting the ending.
If you enjoy being shallow, partying and being bitchy, then I guess you'd want to.

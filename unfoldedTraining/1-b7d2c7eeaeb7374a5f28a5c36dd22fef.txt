The chapters were so short that it was impossible to get into the pertaining plotline.
The storyline was disjointed and bland.
I wasn't that excited about this book to begin with.
I'm not all that interested in books based on the events prior to the classic trilogy but I'm a Star Wars freak and I own every Star Wars based novel so I had to buy this one.
This book was terrible.
Unless you're a die hard fan like me I would not recommend this book.
A Star Wars book usually takes me two to three days to read.
This one took me a week.
It really stinks.
Because of the short chapters I was never compelled to continue to read.
It is almost as bad if not worse than Children of the Jedi.
Sienar was also an interesting guy but that was about it.
The only high point was Tarkin.
I especially couldn't stand the bloodcarver.
The new characters were shallow.
It was interesting to see this character, who had always compelled me, expanded on.

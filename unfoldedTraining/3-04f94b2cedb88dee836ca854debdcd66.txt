I would have given this book a better rating but all the spiritual stuff left me cold.
I don't know.
The spiritual stuff was confusing except when it involved the villan Billy Joe.
I can't describe it very well.
There's a teenage girl in this book that is sure to be the cause of a few errections.
This is one of the most twisted characters I've come across.
I'm not into that kind of thing.
It's pretty dense in places.
Not unless you are thinking In Cold Blood on some kind of drugs.
other times it's like being in a fast car on bad drugs while the devil is driving.
Otherwise this is a hard, freaky trip.
It's different, It's way, way different.
The last time that happened was when I read The Shining.
I got scared several times while I was reading this book.
I wouldn't want to run into the guy who wrote this in a dark alley.
Some of the scenes were like nothing I ever came across before.
I'm going to have to read it again though.

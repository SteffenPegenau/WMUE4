Some of the dialogue had me cracking up-a bad sign.
Peaceful yogis in fact.
It reads a lot like his rap.
I know anythings possible, but this is really far-fetched.
Another common motif is the "Star of David", used for centuries in India, for various esoteric purposes.
Hitler often ridiculed the occult pretensions of Himmler, Hess and others, according to his secretaries and Albert Speer, among others.Oh, by the way, Hitler DID NOT "reverse" the swastika.
A lot of made-up dialogue, and dubious sources.
Remember Col. Ardenti from "Foucault's Pendulum"?
Who came up with this crazy idea?
So using that as a "proof" of Hitler's occultism won't work.
In India, one can see swastikas of all kinds on Hindu Temples.
..seemed like mostly hokum to me.
My own Guru's ashram has them on the Temple columns, same direction as Hitler.
If you liked "Morning of the Magicians" you will find this a good read also, but much more far-out.
No, they are not "black magicians".

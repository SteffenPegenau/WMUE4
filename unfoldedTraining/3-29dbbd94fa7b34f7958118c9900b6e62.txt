I am a HUGE fan of Eddie Izzard (from his stand up comedy and Oceans 12), however, in 13 he had the most bizarre presence.
One more to make up,what you say you,cast???
But i believe as a viewer I deserve a fourth part of high calibre and humour(something missing in part 3).
?
He is a brilliant actor, and yet you utilised his talent minimally, sad.
It was like he was the token Brit in the movie.
He was not even put to good use as an artist.
Wasted talent.
He shows up walks around, swears, thats it!
I expected the world from 13, but was let down.
Both Oceans 11 and 12 were fantastic and i loved them both.
Anyway since i have 11 and 12 i will buy 13 to complete the trilogy.
Come on Steven you could have done better.
His absence wouldnt have been noticed at all!
One and two had so much pizzaz and panache, this was a massive let down.

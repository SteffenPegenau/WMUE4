Absolutely predictable.
There are way too many stereo typical manerisms for black people in this story.
I would suggest the next Angela Bivens story clean up a bit.
It's a book.
Now for the actual story.
Yes, the brother did it.
Who would have guessed?
Most writers do that when they think it will be a better movie than a book.
An will probably remain that way.
Cursing and slang are just to name a few.
This book was written to appeal to the gritty, but the gritty don't do much reading.
ME> The style of writing was fast and I didn't mind the skipping to one scene to the next.
Way too much vulgarity for my taste.
Predictable.
But it's not a movie.

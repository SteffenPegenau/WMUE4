He said forget the graphics, just try it.
He said it was the best racing game out there, so I had to ask the question.
What about Gran Turismo?
The crashes are what makes this game.
He was right, just turn down the music and turn up all of the other sounds.
Well I did and I have been playing it every day since.
I've never seen a racing game like this that really makes you feel like your going that fast.
GO
I love my GT3, but I think this one is more fun.
3.2.1.
My friends and I noticed that just before we hit something we are actually ducking our heads and closing our eyes.
This was a nice surprise.
Don't forget to select Dolby Surround Sound, you'll really hear it when you enter the tunnels.
You don't miss the music when you hear the sound of your body crashing through the windshield at 150 mph.
I hadn't heard anything about this game until a friend showed it to me.
Its that real, I kid you not.
Burnout rules.

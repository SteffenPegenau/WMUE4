I wanted to relate with her but I couldn't.
It reminds me of stories I used to write in high school.
It kept me busy for a few hours but if you really feel like you must read it, borrow it from someone or get it at the library.
The writing in mundane.
The "he said" then "she said" stuff.She pulls it together a little half way through the book.
It's boring.
Each story connected but I felt like she left too much out.
The first chapter gives me a headache.
The characters weren't very believable.
I think this book would have been better if it actually was about hunting and fishing.It starts off, Bank is trying to be witty.
They were cartoons of characters.Overall, it was an easy read.
Don't spend your money.
She jumps around too much.
It seemed really wishy washy.
I enjoyed bits and pieces but the overall story was just lacking something.

They shrunk a bit, but not much.
It does have a built in rope, but it's not elastic and therefore not comfortable.
The elastic is not strong enough to hold the pants up.
I ordered large based on the sizing guidelines.
I then ordered a pair of mediums.
After washing, the large and medium are of almost identical size.
I try to buy only 100% cotton sweats.
The material is fine.
It was too large - especially in the length.
For that reason I ordered these in black which at the time was the only color available in 100% cotton.
However my primary complaint is with the elastic waist.
I give it 2 stars only because it's 100% cotton.
Since 100% cotton is hard to find I decided to wash them in hopes of them shrinking.
They are also too large, again especially in the length.
So the sizing of these pants seems very sloppy.

When it comes to gameplay its great.
Don't get me wrong, this game is good.
The crowds are awesome, the graphics are fair, and the gameplay is great, but once again EA puts no effort into its college hoops game.
Overall not a bad game.
The press works, and you actually have to work to make shots.
Its just like the college game.
Dick Vitale can get a little annoying though.
Besides that, the game has way too many teams, like 320!
They say you can make a team, but in reality, you cant.
Unlike NBA Live where you just pump fake twice, drive and dunk.
The create a team is a joke.
They are hysterical.
Theres about 6 logos, whick suck, and your uniforms aren't even the same colors as your primary colors.
The crowds are incredible, they make the game.
If you like college hoops you should get it.
It takes you forever and then some to find your team.
If you get this game, you have to play the mascot games.

Lucy is still the SUPERWOMAN of all time but she is not in this one as much.
All in all it was fair.
Could it be something that comes out when the moon is full?
What are the hairs from?
Not as good as her very early books.
Marino has be demoted by the new Ass't.
This book is better than some of the others in this series.
As usual Pete Marino is great.
Will she get either one?
Bray is after Marino and Scarpetta.
Chief, a lady named Bray.
A dead man's body leads Dr. Scarpetta on a dangerous mission.
How did he get in the container?
I liked it better because Benson is gone.
On page 83, (paperback) he has mustard on his shirt, his tie is to short and he has on two different color socks.
Strange twist in this one.
This is the other plot going on in the story.
I really like him better than anyone else in in the series.
I lilked this plot in the book better than the "hairy man" plot.
Have to read to find out.

I was hoping the 3rd batch would be better - as it had a best before date of April 2010.
and get a bad batch.
Amazon was nice enough to replace it.
It tasted good and it did a good job of quenching thirst.
Liquid was a bit yellowish in color and it tasted a bit rancid.
It wasn't yellowish, but it was a bit darker in color.
The second batch was January 2010.
I ordered it again and the second time was bad.
I am not contacting Amazon for another replacement.
No more buying coconut water online for me.
Nothing beats fresh coconut juice but this was a good substitute.
I first ordered this in June and was very pleased with the product.
Dissapointing.
And it did not taste like coconut water at all.
But I guess that doesn't really make a difference, as you may get unlucky (twice?!)
BUT ... the 3rd batch was worse.

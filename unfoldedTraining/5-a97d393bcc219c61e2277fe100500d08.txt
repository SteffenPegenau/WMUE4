Check this piece out, it's worth it!
I've seen way too many people rip on this piece.
The rest of the album's great, too, but any other review can tell you that.
Almost exclusively dealing with a simple moral with animal characters.
This is a great album!
It's an intermission, to lighten the mood between the heavy music and meaningful lyrics.
And, before I say anything else, there's one subject I must brooch!
If you take that, and the obvious anti-establishment (for lack of a better term) satire involved, you'll get much more out of this story.
Remember the title?
Midievil passion plays could take a week to perform, and would always have a light-hearted interval, unconnected with the rest of the story.
A PASSION PLAY.
Yes, others have noted that, but they missed a point.
I love it!
You have to understand its purpose.
(And by the way, Ian doesn't do the vocals for The Hare, Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond does.)

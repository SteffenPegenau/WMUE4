I am on my third bluetooth adapter, trying to synch my PC with my Nokia 3650.
Otherwise, AMazon.com may rip you off for the $200.
So I got the Socket.
Live and learn.
Nokia tells me the problem is with Socket.
I'm wishing I didn't buy this phone.To top it off, Amazon.com denied my $200 refund claiming I didn't send it in on time (I did) Since I can't find the post office receipt, I can't proove it.
I send an email.
It doesn't work.
It didn't work and Nokia's tech said, "we don't support Belkin" !!!
ERRG.
MAKE SURE YOU SEND YOUR REBATE FORM IN REGISTERED MAIL AND KEEP THE RECEIPT!!
Since Belkin was the cheaper and smaller, using USB, I bought that.
I leave a voice mail.
I call Socket, wait for 3 hours on hold and never get through.
No response.
First I got a Hawking Bluetooth Adapter, but Nokia said they don't support that.
The tech rep told me they support Belkin and Socket.
No response.

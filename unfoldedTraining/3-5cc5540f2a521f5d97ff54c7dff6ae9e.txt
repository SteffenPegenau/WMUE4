We know that Garp never makes it to the hospital alive, but at least we are allowed the opportunity to create our own ending if we so wish it.
But, they could have left the ending more ambiguous as in The World According To Garp.
Then, the last two minutes on the screen crushed me.
The ending was anti-climatic to say the least.
For its cruel ending, I give Mermaid only 3 stars.
Life is fleeting, I get that.
Mermaid denies us that opportunity.
I'm not asking for a Hollywood happy ending, but the tragedy at the end of the film was unnecessary and cruel.
The irony at the end of Mermaid does not escape me.
I want to love this film.
Had the ending been different, I would have gladly given Mermaid a higher rating.
It was a cheap cop out at best.
I followed her in her journey into womanhood, loving her every step of the way.
From the beginning, Alisa captivated me with her outlook on life.
Really, I do.

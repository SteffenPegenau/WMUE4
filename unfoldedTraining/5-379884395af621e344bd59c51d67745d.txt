without spending ridiculous money like the pros do.
I was looking for a nice set of binos that had great features (waterproof, fogproof, etc.)
Like others have said the lens covers pop off a little too easily but nothing that a little doctoring won't take care of.
I love them!
I read many reviews and decided on the Monarch ATB's.
Great purchase!
Like many working people, I only get to hunt a few times days during the season.
For the money you will not beat them.
They are clear, have great light transmission, adjust easily, and are perfect size.
I love these Binoculars!
I think he was a little sick when he found out how much I paid compared to the amout he paid.I would buy these again in a heartbeat.
I laughed at him after he looked through these.
I looked through my buddies $1100 binos and there is very little difference.
I bought these binos to use while hunting and at the occasional sporting event or concert I get attend.

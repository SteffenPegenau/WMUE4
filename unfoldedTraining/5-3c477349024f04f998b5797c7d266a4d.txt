adds great value to our living room!
if you order "golden oak", it is not the real golden oak, or at least this is not what I think is golden oak.
you just need the right hexa-keys.
i was able to assemble in 10 mins, being a man with handyman inclination.
the top is like the veneer (yellowish white).
so, i have to return and order the honey oak.
beautiful looking table with a solid quality.
but real solid and no compromise with the quality.
before you order, make sure this is the color you want.
thanks amazon for the super hassle-free return policy.then I got the honey oak that exactly mathced my other furnitures and even the wood-flooring in my dining area.
wow!
in terms of quality, construction and assembly, it is great.
the moment i opened the box, I was like, oh.. no!
this is exactly the quality I was looking for to adore the living room.
putting the top part of the table is kinda tricky, so it took time.

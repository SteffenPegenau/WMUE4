I had no problems putting together the stand and then mounting the saw on it.
It was packed very carefully and well.
It is very high quality.
It was off.
You must do this to avoid kickback.
I had just one problem-setting the saw arbor parallel to the miter slot.
Took about 25 minutes.
There IS a difference, called quality.
If not for the parallel problem, this saw would get 5 stars.
The rip fence was a big surprise-its parallel to the blade and its rugged.
Very clear and easy to understand directions.
Once that was done, it was time to go to work.
Get a vacuum hook-up or the bag they sell for it.
The folding table adjustment is awesome.
This is not a stationary heavy weight saw.
This saw is made in Taiwan, not China.
It did great on plywood, oak and ash, both ripping and crosscut.
Its made to be portable and even has a dust chute that gets about 90% of the chips-not bad.
It took me an hour to finally get the arbor parallel.

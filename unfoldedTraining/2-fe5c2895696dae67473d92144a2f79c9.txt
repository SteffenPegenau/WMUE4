Yes, it IS "Sailormoon" and not "Sailor Moon."
But Molly "Brown"!
They completely ruined the beauty of Sailormoon.
This book was NOT Sailormoon.
It's dull reading too.
Watch the original anime and read the manga (if you can, with all those mistakes Mixx makes!
The point is, Sailormoon is Japanese, that's the way it was made.
That's what editors are for, jeez).
Not that I don't like the Backstreet Boys!
If you happen to be one who likes the "dub" and doesn't care about the original, get this book.
They talked nothing about Japanese food or cultures in this book.
But if you REALLY know what Sailormoon is or want to know, DON'T read this book.
I don't think they mention Tokyo once in this book.The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I thought the story itself was well written.
This book is waaaaay too Americanized.
They use English names for Usagi's (or Serena, ugh)classmates, use brand names, and talk about American bands.
It's Japanese!

My replacement pair was here before i even sent the old ones back.
poor quality.
Not clear at all.
I dont know.I must say, the return policy and procedures with AMAZON!
unable to focus and fuzzy around the outer edges.
again.
For the price, usually BARSKA is a great deal, but on these BLACKHAWK binocs something went wrong.
I have other BARSKA products and they are great, just this line of binocs has poor glass or prisms or something.
If your a half way serious hunter, I highly suggest you bone-up and spend the extra cash for a higher quality brand of binocs.
Sent them back for a replacement, and the same thing.
I sent them back for a refund.
is great.
I will be shopping with AMAZON!
I just sent the second pair back for a refund so I hope that its as fast as the return was.
I ordered these binocs and when they came in, wow!

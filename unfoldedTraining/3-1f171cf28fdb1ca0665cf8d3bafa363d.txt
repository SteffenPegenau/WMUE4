Predictable.
I've been reading Cussler since Raise The Titanic.
He's gone from fresh and original, to tarnished and long winded.
Cussler is aging Dirk Pitt, and that's fine.
When Cussler copied Hitchcock's walk-ons with little cameos of himself as a character in the books it was cute.
It was really lame.
Will I keep reading Cussler?
Now it's just annoying, especially since it's no longer a cameo, but a minor character.
But after he reminisced about his long lost, drowned in the underwater lab, girlfriend, you saw the final few pages coming a mile away.
Sure - even his bad books are better than many writer's good efforts.
WHY the briefcase?
The first time.
If you read the book, you know the ending.
What was the point?
The second time it was lane.

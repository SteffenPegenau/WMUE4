But we'll get to those later.
The controls are easy to learn, and the gameplay is great!
He fell overboard.
The 9 missons take you to these places as follows: Ceylon(9 levels), Prauge(13 levels)Istanbul(7 levels), and Hong Kong(4 levels) Yes, I know that's only 4 missons.
The game has 51 levels total.
!Every time you die you have to start at the beginning of the level.Other then that, fun game!
That's because I'm currently in Istanbul.
The game consits of 9 different missons.
Want to get a taste of it?
This game is awesome.
In Prauge I snuck up on a guard who was overlooking a ledge.
I then shot him with my pistol.
The guys you fight at the beginning of the game are wimps, but the enemies gradually get stronger as the game continues.The voice overs are superb, and the combat is even better.
This game does have some cons though.
Now for the cons:No Save Points!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Each misson is divided up into a random amount of levels.
Cool,huh?

Code formatting is impossible to read.
I'd beembarrassed to circulate anything I'd written formatted likethis.3.
SQL 2K coverage is lacking.
There's a way to keep thereader engaged in a technical book.
It looks like the book was written for SQL 7,then retitled when it ran late.What does all this mean?
Ken Henderson's Guru's Guide toTransact-SQL laments this trend and rightfully so.

Code is stupid and unhelpful.

Either theexamples are too kludgy to be useful or too simplistic to teach youanything2.
Writing is terribly dull.

She was extravagently beautiful.
I read most of the major autobiographies.
Certainly her alcohol use with the drugs truely made her Hollywood's child.
I was too young when they were released.
She could not nuture female relationships, probably due to her mother's dismal contributions to her upbringing.
I do think this woman was driven.
I think she made some bad decisions choosing a lifestyle which including drugs.
What she had strived for all her life.
I was so interested in NormaJeane and her psychological background.
In her days they did not know long term effects of any drug much less barbiturates.
Early in her life she did, until ambition won.
She never really bonded to the classical female role.
These movies reflect what she became.
I enjoyed them because of her true talent and remarkable beauty.
I found her a mass of conflicting impulses.

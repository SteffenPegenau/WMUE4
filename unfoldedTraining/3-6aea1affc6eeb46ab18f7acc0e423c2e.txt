But after hearing Stained Class and Hell Bent for Leather, British Steel just doesn't compare.
It's evident in the drumming dept.
(What ever happened to Les Binks)?
(The c.d.- not my opinion).
Just listen to "Grinder", "Living After Midnight", and "Breakin' the you-know-what".
It's a must have for any Priest fan, but choose Screaming, Defenders, Stained Class, or Hell Bent before British Steel.
Don't get me wrong, British Steel has it's good points.
I've always heard people, for some reason, praising this c.d., and I feel it's time to give my opinionated opinion.
Oh yeah, does "United" sound like a high school graduation song, or is it just me?
It's OVER-RATED!
(Well, that was noticable in some of Hell Bent).
And it's definately noticable in the lyrics.
It's more like a retrogression.
Also, there are some good head-banging riffs.
Tom Allom does a surprisingly good job with the production.

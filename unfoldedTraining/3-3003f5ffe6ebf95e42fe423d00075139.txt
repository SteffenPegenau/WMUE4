But I just cant get used to the light songs.
I dont like nobody came, but i do like the Closing.
I like Learn to Hate.
Overall, There are a few heavy songs, and some good rock songs.
Dont get me wrong, I like Silverchair, but this cd is only so-so.
I think the first two songs on this cd are pretty heavy.
The door and a pop song for us rejects are good songs.
Abuse me is an ok song.
I love no association, this is my favorite song.
I like the phrase, throw the sailors overboard, but it is lighter.
Slave has some pretty good riffs and Freak starts out hard.
Lie to me is quick and punky.
Cemetary is light, therefore i dont like the song.
Roses and Petrol and Chlorine are good as well.
It is one of the harder silverchair songs.

I couldn't wait to finish the book to find out if they stay together.
Noah and Allison spent a summer together and fell in love.
Her enjoyment comes from painting.
They haven't seen each other since.
He likes to go canoeing and play the guitar.
When Allison comes back to meet Noah, they fall in love with each other all over again.
This part of the book is very suspensful.
I find myself asking, "Will they fall in love again?"
The main character, Noah Calhoun, is very adventerous.
It was a good book but some parts were dragging.
or "Will they marry some day?"
This book was hard to put down.
Little surprises kept popping up making the reader not put it down.
Since not having met in about five years, this book is very suspensful.
I give this book an eight rating out of ten.
Allison Nelson was the other main character.

is generally classified as synthpop or furturepop.
But as a hardcore industrial and EBM fanatic, I also love synthpop as well.
They were once known as Evil's Toy in the 90's, and by 2001 they changed not only the band name, but also the style of music.
Before judging T.O.Y., you have to take in consideration of their past musical style.
It's not the best, but it is all around a good album.
T.O.Y.
Evil's Toy was labeled as EBM or electro-industrial.
"White Lights" is the second album from T.O.Y, the first being "Space Radio".
T.O.Y.
features more of a dance style to their music, rather than an "evil" style.But bottom line is, both are electronic and great to listen to.
"White Lights" by T.O.Y.
T.O.Y.
"White Lights" is great, but for me personally, I prefer "Space Radio".
differs from Evil's Toy as being cleaned up, more melodic and clear "singing" vocals.
is a good album.

And how about that Legolas?
The acting was absolutely perfect.
Sean Astin really captured his devotion and love for Frodo.
I would have sat through it if it had been ten hours long.
I was amazed at how faithful it was to what Tolkien wrote.
Whew.
The scene where he confronts Boromir was Oscar-worthy in itself.
Aragorn, Frodo and Gandalph were great, but my favorite was probably Sam.
I was so [mad] when it didn't get Oscars for Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor.
There, I said it.
Don't listen to any of these whiny little fools who say it was too long.
I was really worried that they would ruin the story with a bad movie, but it was even better than the book.
This is definitely among my top 5 movies of all time.
And Elijah Wood should have been at least nominated for Best Actor.
Ok, I realize that this is blasphemous, but I loved this movie much more than the book.

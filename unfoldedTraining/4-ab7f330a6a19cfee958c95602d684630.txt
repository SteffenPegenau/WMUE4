A basic Zelda game.
I got this game and it was pretty good.
The levels have fighting and puzzles like all Zelda games.
The bosses are easy, which is disappointing because they are really easy, no challenge at all.
If your a Zelda fan, you should buy this game.
I give this game 4 stars because it's to short.
The graphics are like four swords.
The sound is OK, and of course, if you don't like it, just turn it off.
I beat it in less than a week.
Finally, the story is excellent.
This game is really creative.
You'd really enjoy it.
Besides its that, this game was really fun.
A new bad guy comes looking for power, turns Zelda to stone, you have to gather 4 elements and reforge a sword.
Shrinking with a hat, pretty original.

So I decided to purchase the first season and watch it.
I literally had a bad headache after watching the two episodes.
And it's not a subtle little movement of the camera -- it's a lot.
I also enjoyed 24 but it did go a bit over the top toward the end.
I am a huge fan of the BBC's MI-5 (Spooks), probably my favorite TV show ever.
Just tonight I tried again with another episode, but I had to look away and just listen.
We both decided we just couldn't watch anymore.
I wonder if seasons 2 and 3 had the same problem.
Sigh.
While traveling in Canada, I saw an episode or two of the Border and really enjoyed it.
The problem we had with it though is the camera work.
My wife and I just sat down and watched the first two episodes.
As for plot, acting, tension, etc., it was OK, nowhere near as good as MI-5, but still interesting.
In every episode, every scene is the "artsy" hand-held camera mode made popular in movies like Blair Witch.
(Note, I'm not sure what season it was.)

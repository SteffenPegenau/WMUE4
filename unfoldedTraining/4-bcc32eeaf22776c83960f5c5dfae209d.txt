I was amazed at how the author described the sports sences.
But then,the last page was so stupid.
We NEVER know what happens to Erik,Arthur,Kerri, or anyone!
I could close my eyes and be there.
The characters were well descibed.But...When i got to the last 20 or so pages,I was thrilled.
So much was happing ,i was amazed.
They NEED to make a sequal.
I loved this book.
What about hte muck fire,and the lightning,and the soocer team.
Also,I was hooked on the first page which is not something that usually happenes for me.
It was so intense.
The book could and should have had aleast annother 50 pages.But otherwise it was a grreat book.
We never know what happened to Arthur.And how does Pauls 3rd first day of school work out (I cant say why..read it yourself.
I had to read it for summer reading,and was hooked.
what about Paul,does he get contacts or laser eye surgrey?
They were left completely unfinish.
What aobut the main plots of the book?

I am returning the grinder.
The cutting blade on this grinder is paper thin compared to my sisters which is about 8 years old.
The problem didn't seem to exist several years ago.
The meat was cut in small chunks and partially frozen.
Again small pieces of metal and some grease.
When I received my grinder from Amazon I was so excited to grind some beef for burger.
After going back to Amazon reviews I see several people have had the same problem.
I took the appliance apart and tried again.
I had borrowed my sisters food grinder and loved it.
I do not feel this is a Amazon issue but rather a Kitchenaid problem.
I was shocked to see tiny particles on my meat after grinding.
My sisters is also heavier.
It worked like a dream without any issues.
Wish I had read more recent reviews.
Very disappointed.

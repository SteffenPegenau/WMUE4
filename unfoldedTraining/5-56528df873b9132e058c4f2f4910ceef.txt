And you know what?

This is paradise on a disc, baby!
You know you wanna buy this... diddle1987@hotmail.com .
Ever heard the song "Perfect Day" by Hoku?
Um, okay.
'Course you did!
Don't forget, "Perfect Day" will make your day perfect.
Talking about faith, people.
You liked it?
This CD is not just for all the blondes out there, I'm not a blonde and I really liked it.
C'mon guys, let your inner music style get out and order this!
The songs are great, the movie is great, it's all great.
It's a perfect CD for the summer and to cheer you up in the winter.
So I bet you will too.
Even guys will enjoy it but are to chickenish to admit it.
That song is on the soundtrack!

You just have to see it to believe it!
Others have played Kong off as an overgrown pervert, while others made him into a freak of nature with a temper to match!
I wont spoil the details!
Sadly, Ive seen alot King Kongs, and well it always hasnt been a pretty picture!
Now, get the book!
Some have portrayed him as a giant clown in a rubber suit crashing through cardboard buildings.
It has alot of beautiful paintings and it explains alot about the mythos of KING KONG!
Lets face it, the original movie left us wanting more.
Let me tell you...this book is great!!!
I guess for a while I thought it was always going to be that way, but not with Kong: King of Skull Island!
You got to get this book!
This book gives you that and then some!
Ever since I was a kid, I have always been into King Kong.
and oh yes...have a nice day!
Alot has been lost throughout the years.
If you are like me and are tired of all the Kong wannabees!

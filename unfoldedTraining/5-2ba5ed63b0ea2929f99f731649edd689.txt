It's kind of odd that an entire season of this show is dedicated to that single purpose, but it's still really fun.
Season 2 is a little better than the first one.
I think that it's a safe bet for most anime fans.
It's a lot of fun to watch.
There are a couple background episodes for the main characters.
I think that they are gonna continue this series even further.
It's a lot of fun.
The first time I watched Baka and Test, I was a little let down.
The language is moderate, and there isn't any nudity.
Season 2 is pretty much just about the guys of class F trying to peep on the girls' changing room and bath.
The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all still really good.
I watched a couple more times, and I really liked it.
I hope they do.
I highly recommend it.
Season 2 picks up right where season 1 left off.
So 14 and up is a good rating.

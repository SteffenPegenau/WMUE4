They grow up.They get hormones.
For about fiveminutes.
I am guessing you are seeing where this is going by now.
They get too cool for each other.
They are friends.
If you are me and LUV Omar Epps, then this is a movie for you.
Or basketball wrapped around a romance.
If you don't know who Danaa Lathan (The Best Man, The Wood and Blade)is yet, then this is a movie for you.Basically, Love and Basketball is a great movie.
It is cute, sweet and it has girls playing some awesome ball, which is always a good thing.This is a romance wrapped around basketball.
A little teeny-bopper and predictable and all that jazz, but who cares?
Girl likes boy.
They go steady.
If you are like me and LUV basketball then this is a movie for you.
Boy likes girl.
Either way, it has all the makings of a chick flick but it isgood anyway.

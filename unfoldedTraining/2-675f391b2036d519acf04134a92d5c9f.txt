In fact there is hardly no interaction at all.
I dont recomend this game unless you like to go solo in online games and not work in groups.
I thought it would never end.
Aren't Online games games where people work together to accomplish tasks?"
Of course I wanted to play it.
Well not in this game.
I was over at my friend's house, and he has City of Heroes.
There is no crafting in this game I thought, "wow, then how do people get money to buy items?
", well there ius no items.
I thought, "well then whats the point in making it an online game?
After I made my character the troble started.
When i first started I was impressedwith the Character Creation screen, this was one of the best character screens i have seen.
Finaly when i finished it i started playing in my first city.
I started to play the tutorial.
The tutorial was SOOOOOOOOOO long.
I play Star Wars Galaxies where I am used to changing professions and gaining skills by crafting ect.

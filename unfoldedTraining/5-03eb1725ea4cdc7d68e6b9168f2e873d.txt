Tons of different options.
I would highly recommend this sewing/embroidery machine if you love to sew.
Mickey comes out perfectly!
I have had this machine for 1 yr now.
It was very easy to set up the embroidery.
All the settings are awesome.
The directions on this machine are very easy to understand and read.
I have never had a problem.
You can change the color of the thread in less than 30 seconds.
Some of fav.
I love the embroidery on the machine.
I comes with a open foot so you can see what you are doing.
I love how easy it is to thread the machine.
things about this machine are: It cuts the tread for you, you can set the machine to sew by pushing 1 button, so easy to put spin the thread on the bobbin and my favorite thing is satin stiching.
It sews perfectly.
I also have the Brother serger lock 1034 D that is a great serger for $199.

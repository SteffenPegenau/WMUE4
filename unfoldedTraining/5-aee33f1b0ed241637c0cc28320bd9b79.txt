She loves to stroll !
This stroller is built very well.
We get so much attention when we are out strolling.
It is comfortable for her inside, plenty of room to move around.
We go out every day.
I am SO happy I bought this!
People think it is a baby I'm pushing and when they see it is a cat, they are so surprised and have a big smile on their face.
She loves her stroller!
There is a big screened window in front and in the back and a smaller one on top so plenty of viewing and your pet can see you.
I have an indoor only, 15 year old cat and a couple of months ago I bought her this stroller.
Any cat or dog that gets one of these strollers is very lucky.
There are good brakes, storage underneath and a key etc holder by the handles.
It is all screened in so she cannot get out, not that she has even tried.
Easily room for 2 cats.
I love the pink.

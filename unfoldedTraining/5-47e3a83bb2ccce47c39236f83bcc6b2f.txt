So nice to have just one remote.
Some of it was my fault some was Logitech's fault.
Eventually, a couple of hours later, I got the remote to work just fine with everything.
When I went to program one of the buttons for the T.V., the drop down menu Logitech provided did not have the button name I needed.
I have 5 compnents hooked up to the remote.
I qualify everything I say with the fact that I am not a videophile or tech junkie.
That is where the trial and error came in.
I know I am.
My wife did all the research.
I just had to try different things until I found one that matched.
It is awesome now that I have the bugs worked out of it.
It took awhile to get them all to work properly.
I was given this as a gift so I did not look into any other remotes.
It took some trial and error.
I think you will be happy with this remote.
It was frustrating at first because the buttons would not do what they were suppose to.
I wish the buttons were a little bigger and easier to read.

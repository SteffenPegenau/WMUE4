I mean SOME of the songs were OK, but most all of them were blaa.
.
I didn't at all like this CD-set .
Actually I shouldn't even say SOME - I only like 2!
So I went and bought this, and then hated it!
I can't imagine what regular CDs are like since they're NOT "best of" ones!
She's, I think, the best female singer out there - Wait For Me (a best of) is her best CD!
After I heard Keep The Candle Burning and Day By Day on WOWs, I thought they're music was wonderful.
I couldn't recommend this or any Point of Grace CD.
The more I heard more of their music - I realized that out of ALL of it, they only have 2 good songs.
So I couldn't tell you to get this one, but I could tell you to check out Rebecca St. James.
So out of 24 best of songs, I only like 2.
But what I didn't think was that those were the BEST songs of their's, and they're still not the greatest!
I ended up selling it.
OK, their new song "I Choose You" is pretty good, but that's it.

However, I am still waiting for the correct DVD to be sent as I was mistakenly sent Boyz II Men.
The turnaround time is supposedly 2-4 weeks.
"Rhythm of Love"3.
Unbeatable.
I would have like more, but for the price?
The 5 music videos on this DVD are:1.
!
"No One Like You"I emailed one of the sellers to ask.
"Still Loving You"5.
Unacceptable, but that has nothing to do with the content of the DVD.
"Rock You Like A Hurricane"2.
Okay, are you ready?
If you want more videos, purchase A Savage Crazy World.
"Believe in Love"4.
It will cost more though!

Hopefully this one will last.
That happens when you want to make the highest quantity of coffee.
When you want to move it to clean around it the silver part is actually hot to the touch.
I do not like that.
We used the filters we already had and noticed that some grounds were mixed in with the coffee.
Also you need to purchase special filters for the grounds.
We like to set the timer before we go to bed and then have the coffee ready when we wake up.
We really wish it had a timer on it as well.
It does makes a pot of coffee in 3 minutes.
So it makes sense to purchase their filters because they sit higher in the funnel.
I know its only 3 minutes but it was what we were used to before we had to replace our last one ..
My cousin recommended this brand of coffee maker to us.
The one thing I do not like is the fact that it is always on.
We have had several different brands in the years past.
The water is kept hot in the system.

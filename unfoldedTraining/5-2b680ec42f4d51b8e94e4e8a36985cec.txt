Hatebreeder is classic Alexi.
Anyways more about the album.
Where do i start about Bodom.
Every drum part flows and connects well from riff to riff.
He writes hook laden songs that do not compromise speed, technicality, or overall aggressiveness.
Not as classical as Something Wild but just the right blend to keep everything fresh.
What the hell are these people listening to?
The best tracks are Silent Night Bodom Night, Hatebreeder, Children of Bodom, and Black Widow.
I love this album and you should too.
I do not honestly see how someone could say this band is untalented.
Alexi is the greatest guitar player of his time and any album he is on it shows.
Granted CoB does not have mainstream appeal but there is no denying the talent.
This is the best drumming CD that CoB have.
That's a statement considering CoB is know for guitars.
And then the guitars, oh my god.

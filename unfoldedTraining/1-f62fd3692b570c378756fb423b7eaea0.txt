Does she die of starvation?
Dull!
He goes on and on about her- yet we stay mistified.
Here is what we come away with: Mr. Roth is very bitter about the United States.
Who was Rita Cohen?
The plot is very thin and the commentary about american life is very thick.
I didn't disagree with any of his ideas but instead thought, "so what"?
What about his life after Dawn?
We have to sift through many ideas and counter ideas but never learn what happens!
What happens to Merry?
While the novel is extremely well written, it drones on and on and in the end is very disappointing.
Does she go to jail?
Not believable.
We don't know.
In this story it seemed that the problems of the United States caused the problems of the hero.
Voila.

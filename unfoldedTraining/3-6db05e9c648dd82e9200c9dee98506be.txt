I couldn't rate her less than a 3 star out of respect for the knowledge but...whew... think twice.
Hard to grasp.
Boring.
Convuluted.
I got through it, but I'll never go back again!
Love the knowledge.... but wow.
This book has her extensive knowledge, but it is wrapped up in a writing delivery that exceeds her baseline worse.
I got this book knowing that I would face the same struggle, but I love to hear and read all different interpretations and information to add to my own knowledge.
So, I got it.
(ironic that it is neptune she is writing about).
I feel tortured.
She is not, and has not been the most riveting of writers.
Dry.
I've waded through her other works and have been glad I had the determination to do so, but can't say I've ever enjoyed her books.
Liz Greene is a strong, worthy voice of modern astrology.

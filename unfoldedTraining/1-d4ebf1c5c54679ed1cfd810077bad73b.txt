The light turned on.
My microphone was working at okay quality even.ONE WEEK LATER.
Outrageous.I DID eventually get it working, but:So I read online that you can make it work by turning on the computer with the USB already plugged in.
That trick doesn't work any more.
Unlike him, however, I'm using Windows 7 not XP.
It's trash.
You're still including this CD and you CLAIM right in the description that this works for all versions of Windows.
As the other reviewer said, when you plug it in it gives a "USB Not Recognized" error.
Just plug it in, and bam you're recording your microphone.That's not the case at all.
Don't buy it.
When I first got this I expected it to be just as easy as it says.
I did get it to work eventually, but here's the thing: it wasn't from their stupid driver CD they included.That CD only works for Windows 98 of all things.
Really?
Yeah, it worked.
I tried it in every USB slot.
The USB never lights up.
Unbelievable.

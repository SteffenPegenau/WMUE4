So it was definitely not overloaded.
And, I was trying to grind only half a jar full.
My sister bought the same machine and she has the same issues.
So I just took the new jar with the contents and used it with my old Sumeet.
This one seems to be so poorly made.
It is not easy to try and get to the reset button.
When I moved to the U.S., I bought a Sumeet and used it for 10 years but the jars started falling apart.
But that machine can grind.
So I recently replaced it with a brand new Sumeet.
When I used the new Asia Grinder, it just kept tripping.
Growing up we always had a Sumeet and they worked great.
I had to keep resetting the load protector.
But, I am really focused on function here, so decided to use it.
The unit just cannot handle the grinding.
The finish on the product is pretty poor.
Coincidentally it fits well on the old Sumeet grinder and it worked great - It ground very fine.This new machine is terrible and I wouldn't spend the money on it.

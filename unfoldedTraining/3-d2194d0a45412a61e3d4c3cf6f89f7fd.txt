That was it.
The stuffing is noisy.
The bed is very well made.
The surface is slippery under a lot of weight.
He was done with it.
It's very easy to puff up the bed.
Despite all of that my dog hates it.
The fabric is resistant to liquids and very durable.
I put an old blanket over it and my Australian Shepherd slept on it.
I bought it for my Great Dane/Lab mix who weighs about 125 lbs.
We can't keep it in the bedroom.
For large breed dogs, they will slide.
All in all is a well made bed with limited use.Fatboy Doggielounge, Large, Orange
He thought it was great but the bed makes a lot of noise.
When he first sat on it, his front paws slid off the bed.

i loved their 1st album (through these eyes) and got this one the day it was released.
Recognize 10/104.
Worlds Divide 8/1010.
track #10 (decide) is also really good.1.
skip the 1st 2 tracks (medicate and endangered species) and also skip #4 (wait for me) the 1st 2 tracks are awful, especially the lyrics and #4 is REALLY bad.
that being said, track 3 and 5-12 are all pretty good.
Not Enough 8/10
Many Faces 7/106.
Turn the Tables 8/109.
Final Cry 7/1012.
#3 Recognize is excellent, especially if you loved the 1st album.
Decide 10/1011.
the strings arrangement on this song make a bad song even worse.
Endangered Species 2/103.
Wait for Me 0/105.
Medicate 2/102.
am a bit disapointed after a handful of listens.
All the Worst 6/107.
You've Changed 7/108.

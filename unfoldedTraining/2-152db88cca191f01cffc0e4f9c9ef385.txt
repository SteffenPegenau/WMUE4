Nada!
I get the chainsaw and use it once in the first couple days ... no problems.
Originally, Amazon would not take the return; I was not happy!
No worky!
Well, its under warranty and the manual says to just return it to the seller.
Nothing!
In fact, I was pretty happy with the product.
The thing doesn't even try.
I'll update after a few runs, and I've got a small tree to take down next.
And finally, three cheers to Amazon for doing the right thing!
But all is good there.
But after a nice online chat, Amazon agreed to replace it.
For that, I have upgraded my star rating from 1 to 2 in hopes that the next one will work more than once.
I'm thinking its got to be the cord or the outlet, something like that!
Then, four or five weeks later I get it out and attempt to use it again.
I'm really frustrated with the product and Amazon (at first).

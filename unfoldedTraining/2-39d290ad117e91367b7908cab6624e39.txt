Venice sure is pretty.
Nice work, if you can get it.
And the Italian lover?
If you want to see Hepburn do something sparkling in this time period, check out DESK SET, with Spencer Tracy.
I can't bear the thought of putting a Lean and Hepburn effort into the same cesspool as my one-star films.
You know, Ben Stiller could have done something in that role (and with the script), except he wasn't born yet.
What did Hepburn play?
And now onto the story.
Oh, that's right.
Now, that's a story.
Computers!
I'll give this flick a second star.
What an opportunity for David Lean to explore color movie making just a couple of years before he began creating his streak of brilliant films (Bridge On the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago).
And for the film crew, a trip to Venice, Italy!
And down-sizing in 1957!
A retired office worker from Akron, Ohio?
One star for Venice.

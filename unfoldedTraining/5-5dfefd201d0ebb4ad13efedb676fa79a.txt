All is done with his brilliant accoustic guitar and a fine backing group.In conclusion Blood on the Tracks is Dylan's most listenable and appealing album.
It is a folk rock classic.
Dylan's Greatest Achievement.
This is Dylan's most personal albums.
Is it Blonde on Blonde?
Is it Highway 61?
No fan of real music should be without it!
For his first three classics he explored the problems of the world.
He explores love being won and love being lost.
He sings of kindness and generosity.
He explores the difficulties of his own life.
You could debate for hours on the topic of what is the greatest Dylan album.
He sings of being "Tangled Up in Blue", looking out for a "Simple Twist of Fate", and of a woman giving him "Shelter From the Storm."
GET IT NOW!
Is it Bringing it All Back Home?Though they are all brilliant albums the best of Dylan's 30 plus studio albums would have to be Blood on the Tracks.

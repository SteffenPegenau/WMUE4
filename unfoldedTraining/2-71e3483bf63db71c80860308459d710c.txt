I know there was a great concert there somewhere because I heard it.
One reviewer said that they changed images about 50 times a minute.
So as far as the band and the music I easily give this disk 5 stars.
The concert I attended was excellent - a very high energy show.
I bought this DVD a week after I saw Dierks in concert.
I thought that was an exaggeration but he was spot on.
If you don't mind that buy the DVD.
The music on this DVD is recorded extremly well.
I wanted to get this DVD to see if I could capture that excitement in a DVD I could watch at home.
The problem is the video portion.
It was like an MTV spin where the scene changes almost constantly.
There is no scene in the whole DVD that lasts more than 5 seconds.
Nope it was him singing and very well with tunes I love.
If you do then see Dierks live as he puts on a great show.
It is so clear I had to look a few times to make sure they weren't lip syncing.
But I couldn't see a concert.

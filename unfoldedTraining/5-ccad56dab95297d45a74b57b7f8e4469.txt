The bonus track is hilarious!!
If you are a Blink 182 fan this is a must buy!!
This CD is one of the best CD's ever!!!!!!
So pick it up if you get the chance and enjoy it like I do!!
I love it and I can't stop listening to it!!
The whole CD is full of great lyrics and music!!
The best songs in my opinion are First Date, Online Songs, Take Me Home, and Stay Together For The Kids!!
I have two of their CD's, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket and Enema of the State.
If you get a CD it should be this one!!
They sound great!!
Blink 182 is a great band and this is a great CD!!
You have to get this CD!!
I can listen to this one without skipping through one Track!!
If you like good music get it!!
!
To me they are both equal in greatness!!!

Very basic looking.
Iron Ware last forever; just don't drop it.
I thought it was the original CorningWare, not just the brand name on this version.
Just for baking, or as a seving dish.
CAN NOT be used in microwave, on top of stove, or broiling.
I looked at the reviews, which were excellent, and I should have read the product description fully.
Oh well.
Easy clean up.
Does the job.
None broke even though some were dropped.
Can't let it soak in the sink to long or will craze if used for baking and not fully dried, because it absorbs water at it's base.
They of course will be used, but I have a number of original items, and been using them for about 38 years.
You can go directly from the freezer to stove top, oven, broiler, and microwave.
It is Iron Ware.
Very Heavy.
My bad.I will look on the internet for the old kind.

M. Christian's historical erotica jumped off the page at me.
Making me want to hurl one onto the sidewalk.This was the place that I discovered M. Christian.
But Buffy was having a bad day.EroticaAnthology called to me from a bookshelf.
I was startled.I would soon get into the harder stuff: Dirty Words.
Nasty.
Tweaking my lungs.
It was a smoggy California day as I walked into BookStore.
An imaginative and hot read!
throw in a classic film sensibility.
noir, eros and humor meet speculative fiction.
As I walked into the dive, a clerk sneered at me.

"Sssssshhhhh!"
"Authentic, literate, twisted, edgy .
I'd hoped for a greeting.
I'd definitely recommend Dirty Words, especially for those readers who are looking for something different."

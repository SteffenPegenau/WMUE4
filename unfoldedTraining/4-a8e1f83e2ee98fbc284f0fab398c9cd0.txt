Everyone does a good job.
The plot and writing arent perfect but get the point across.
Its the heart of the movie in my opinion.
When viewing the movie you cant find fault with the acting.
The action is great, though I could argue that the dogfighting is too short.
The bond between the men as they battle together works well.
The battles could have been longer but they are well executed.
!
I was expecting Flyboys to tank.
We have two people that speak different languages and they fall in love.
And it didnt.
Very good movie!!
The movie could have had some help at the box office if it had a different name (Flyboys sounds dumb to me) and more advertising leading up to its release.
The romance though is the key here for me.
You just get the blood pumping and that particular fight ends too soon.

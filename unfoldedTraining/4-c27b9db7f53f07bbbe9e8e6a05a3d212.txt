Yes.
I understand people who are angry about spending the original price on this when it was new but I purchased mine for about 1/6 that.
Warlords alone is worth how much these cost now.
The controllers are better than the original pro-line controllers in my opinion and with hacking a Nintendo controller can be made to work with this.
First off, many people don't like this game because the emulation is bad.
Emulation?
I've played many of the real Atari video game systems and yes, the games on here do differ, a lot in some games.
Are the games fun?
Yes.
Okay, so the bleep sound was supposed to be a bloop.
^-^ Anywho, fun, emulation sucks, good value, ect...
What I look at is how good it is for what it is.
Why do you need an old game to be perfectly emulated?
Are the controllers good?
Does that make the game less fun?

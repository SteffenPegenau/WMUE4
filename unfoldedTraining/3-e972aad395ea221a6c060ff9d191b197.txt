How?
Unfortunately, the last 20 minutes ruined what could have been an excellent film.
How does this make you feel fulfilled when the credits come on?
It was only the end that was bad.
He commits an unjust murder.
Too bad indeed.
And he gets away with it too!
And then you ask yourself,"How is this justice.
About 20 minutes before this film ended, I was sure that I was going to put this film on my favorite films of all time list.
How is the longing for justice fulfilled?"
But, the end is the most important part of the story.
Now, I don't believe it would do wrong to reveal that Sean Penn's character, Jimmy, murders at the end.
As for the rest of the movie, I have no complaints.
Shakespeare had something called a catharsis.
The acting was superb, the drama was tense, the script was good, and Clint Eastwood did a superb job of directing.
The last part that makes you feel satisfied.
Yes-indeed.
It is what's supposed to happen at the end.

I cannot speak to what happened to Saint Exupery.
Nothing has ever been proven.
As Stacy Schiff said"he pursued time more than it courted him".
I disagree.
If you love Saint Exupery, read this book last.
This is part of the tapestry that was his life.
We had so little time with him.
My point, he loved this book.
It's a real jewel.
He disappeared shortly after writing this masterpiece.
Some say that this should have not been released at all, out of respect for the writer.
He read it to a girlfriend completely.
I can read this, his last intended release, and draw many conclusions about his state of mind and his intentions the day that he flew off, never to return.
I love it too.
He wanted to read it cover to cover in one sitting.
All I know is, he shared this book with many.
He was tired from a trip and he finished reading it to her later.

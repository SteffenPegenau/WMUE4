i had always loved björk very much..but after vespertine i started to adore her... it was the best cd i had ever had..so it made me curious about the forthcoming album.butdefinitely medulla did not make me satisfied..i din not findfind it so much interesting or atractive..it is unfortunatelyunlistenable and weak i think...it is like wearing paperclothes..making it can be enjoyable wery much but listening isnot..some of the vocals comes so immature that while listeningi'm trying not to hear but i can not succeed...in brief it isthe worst björk album...1.

I love House.
I'm here to talk about the season 1 box set.
It's a great show though; there's no doubt about that.
They are so very easy to scratch.
I was lucky to get it for an excellent bargain, because now that I have it I'm a little miffed.
I don't even know how it happened.
I hope with future releases they will have normal one-sided discs.
I've already gotten a tiny scratch on one of the discs that now makes one scene skip.
My other (much smaller) complaint is that there is a lack of bonus materials.
There are some, but I was hoping for a little more.
Then I would store away the originals.
It's hard to hold the dvds without touching at least one side of them.
My major complaint is that these are double sided discs.
My advice is not to buy these until you have the capability of copying them.
It's a great show, but I'm not here to review the show.

My tea doesn't get totally cold as it would without a warmer.
But, after many years of use, it died.
At times, my hot tea would be too hot, but I was ok with it.
Well, it DOESN'T keep my hot tea hot like my old warmer.
The main complaint was that it didn't get very hot, and barely kept your beverage warm.
I gave it a chance anyway because of the brand.
At best, it keeps my tea "luke warm".
But, I do find that sometimes, I still get up & pop my tea in the microwave to make it hot, and then I put it back on my warmer.
But, Mr. Coffee had the least negativity.
I had an "off the wall brand" coffee cup warmer sitting on my desk at work for years.
LOVED IT!
It's better than nothing.
I guess I am spoiled by the old warmer I had.
So, I researched the internet, found & read reviews on the different coffee cup warmers.
They all had positive & negative feedback.
I couldn't find another one like it.

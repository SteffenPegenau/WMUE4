After the BS album "10," I (and other after each album from him) always wonder how he will come on the next one and if he could do it again.
When I saw young teenage boys going sick over the song, I knew he had a hit.
First I aksed myself "why did he go with Timbaland?"
memories and it grew on me.
releases what he thinks will be his commercial joint instead of releasing his hottest joint.
He was dominating 106 and Park for a while.It took me a while to get into this one as the first joint that I heard from him was "Feel the Beat."
Well it worked out for him.
Why do a lot of people stick with has-beens?
"Feel the Beat" would get 5...
I give the song 4 because of the L.L.
As usual, L.L.
I was hoping that this would be his first single because that song is the single hottest on the album.
That song made me get the album.
I wish he would have just made two videos.
Remember when "back Seat" was a B-side until it blew up?
At least he put "Feel the Beat" in the video.

cummings poem, had cummings gone the way of Poe.
A give-and-take album, but, as usual, you always get more than you expect from Waits.

.
Songs like "The Briar and the Rose", "Lucky Day" and "The Last Rose of Summer" are harrowing little folk tunes (one intentionally reminiscent of the ol' tune "Barbara Allen"), and "Russian Dance" is a gloriously sad instrumental, so aurally masterful, you can almost see a bunch of drunk serfs dancing their miseries away.
loud and horrific and fragile and beautiful all at once .
it has the madness and tendnerness of an e.e.
but at its heart, it's just Waits, through and through, which deserves close to 5 stars, if not the whole.
Not an easy listen .
Worth the effort.
The many musicians give their heartfelt all.
.
Not a fan of Burroughs, the album occasionally gets lost in its own self-conciousness, and is occasionally self-indulgent (read Waits' "artistic" liner notes) .

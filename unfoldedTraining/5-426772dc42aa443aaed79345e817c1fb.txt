old -- just to tell you this is not "teeny-bop", or only for pre-teens, or something ridiculous like that.
Every word of the reviews above are true, true, true.
I am 50 yrs.
Not like so many releases with 3 songs you really like, and the rest dross.
The energy, variety, the voices, the rhythm, the drums, the singing, the lyrics.
Really!
A PERFECT cd.
Don't deprive yourself of this experience/event.
I first read about Smoosh about 2 weeks ago in a Spin magazine.
I listen to a LOT of music, of all kinds, including plenty of new stuff, and this is something authentic, remarkable, and new.
I haven't been thrilled with an entire CD, without exception, for years.
I CANNOT wait for their next release.
I am entranced with She Like Electric.
It's not like anything else.
I listen to this CD every day, at least twice.

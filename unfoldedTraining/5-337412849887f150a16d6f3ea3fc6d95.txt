I don't think Lynyrd Skynyrd was great enough to get his box set though but they are my favorite southern rock band.
God bless you and have a great day.
Comin home is a song that you do not hear on the radio.
I close my eyes when I listen to Simple Man.
Free bird was a great long song for Lynyrd Skynyrd.
It's so cool.
Sweet home Alabama is a pure classic.
You might here it on the radio all the time but it still great to listen to.
Lynyrd Skynyrd helped make southern rock what it is today.
A good price for 25 songs.
Those are really good songs.
There are just so many songs on here that really rock.
It is pure art of music.
The all time greatest hits did not have simple man of workin for MCA.
Gimme three steps, call me the breeze, workin for Mca, and what's your name are jamming songs that make you feel good inside and joyful.
That song is very inspiring and true to man.

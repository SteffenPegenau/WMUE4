You sir are a moron.
But don't come preach this BS of peoples morals lacking.
Don't like what your watching?
Don't like what your hearing?
This has nothing to do with morals.

Kids are not stupid.
These are what video games are.
Most know right from wrong and if they don't, it's more reflected on the parents.
Ever hear the term "entertainment purpose only"???
I have strong family vales and morals, but I love to sit down and play games for "ENTERTAINMENT" I don't play San andreas and plot later that night to go knock over a conveniece store or take my car and run over hookers downtown.
Don't they have groups for people like you?
Mind your business!!!
Turn it off!!
I can't stand you types of people.
Turn it down.

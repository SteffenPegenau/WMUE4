This of course is expected of any manservant.
keep your opinions to yourself even if called upon to express them.
I'm a big Anthony hopkins fan.
There's no drama, nigh but a hint of emotion.
Not even a happy or sad ending.It begins and ends on the same note.
BORING SCRIPT and good acting.
No heart ache, no close friendship developing.
Do your job.
Boy thats a walk in the park for Anthony Hopkins to play a stone faced butler with a whisper or two of facial emotion While Emma Thompson (head maid) subtley attempts to get him to express them , but in such a boring fashion.
Nothing but boring lines of conversation.
It's not her fault and it's not Anthony hopkins fault.The script is boring.
As a butler in white ivory England the only thing expected of him was to play the role of a butler with supressed emotions.
He never fails to live up to or exceed the limitations of any script put in front of him.
No love, not even a whisper of a thrill.
No plot.

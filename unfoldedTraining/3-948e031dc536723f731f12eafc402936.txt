All buttons are easily "thumbable" while racing.
All of this is in the game instruction book.
If not, go with another.
If you NEED Pedals, then get this wheel.
The pedals are realistically spring loaded.
The steering control is too smooth (there is NO RESISTANCE, NONE, ZERO, ZIP).
But the set-up is sweet.
Monaco for instance requires that you have a Dreampad plugged into port one and the Wheel in port two.
Now for the review.
But there are other products out there, that may be better suited for you.
Nice construction and very comfortable to use.
It is compatible with ALL Dreamcast Racers.
That is really the only thing going for this one.
That said however, you may have to adjust the way you have it set up.
This wheel is not as bad as others may tell you it is.
The wheel is tilt/height adjustable.

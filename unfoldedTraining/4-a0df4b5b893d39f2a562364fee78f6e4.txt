This book by Carl Hiaasen has some action in it.
There father is in jail for sinking a boat called the Coral Queen.
Even sell there favorite boat to lice, who is a big jerk.
She keeps on bringing up the word divorce.
I would recommend this book to people who like interesting stories and action stories.Now I will give a summery of this book.
There is action and maybe even murder.
But he only sunk the boat because they were dumping swage in the water.
There main subject is to try and get him out.
Noah and Abbey will do anything for proof.
This book is about a boy named Noah and his sister Abbey.
Out of 10 stares I would give it a 9.
If I liked it I think you will to!
But there also worried for there mom.
The book I read for my book report was Flush.
This book has a lot of twists and turns to it.
At one point he gets out of jail, but you have to read the rest to see what happens next.In my conclusion I think you should read this book.

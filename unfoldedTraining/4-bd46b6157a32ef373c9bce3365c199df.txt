Hope I helped!
I finished it in 2 long sittings.
But with this game it was simple.
When I was done I sat open mouth thinking thats it!?
This game was great.
But I was amazed because usually nancy drew games are difficult for me and I would have to download the strategy guide.
:( Usually it takes me a couple of weeks before I finish games.
And I realized when I finished this game that it was short.
SO YOU SHOULD HAVE SOMEONE HELP YOU IF YOU ARE LITTLE.
TRUST ME YOU DO NOT WANT TO GO OUT THERE WITHOUT MAP.
If you are a beginner this is a great game to play.
ALSO THERE ARE ALOT OF TURNS.
The theme was awesome the graphics were great.
I thought that this game didnt have alot of puzzles also.
But overall this game was good.
HINT: BEFORE GOING IN THE WOODS LOOK IN THE CABINET OVER THE SINK AND GET A MAP.
But you should still get this game.
I enjoyed it but In my mind I thought there has to be more.
I have 5 nancy drew games.

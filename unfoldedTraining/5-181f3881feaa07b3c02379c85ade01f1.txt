Now, if you are of a certain age...the age much close to the end than the beginning...you had a father or an uncle who was once when he was young deep into the muck of WWII and likely you never understood it...never questioned the 'good' war' because it just wasn't done.
Do not read it if you value sleep above all else.How does one rate the horror?
Your choice.
It takes the madness of war to the realm of poetry and philosophy.
Sleep well.
But....You and me and all the readers will come close..as close as you can get.
Ten stars or ....zero because of the fallibility of our leaders.
It will stick to you until you die.
Read this at your own risk.
Beware.
You are entering the realm of hell.
Well the author does question it and the answer is out there in the wind that never ever seems to stop blowing.
Sleep well readers.
You and me weren't there.
This book is a prose poem.
Not ever.

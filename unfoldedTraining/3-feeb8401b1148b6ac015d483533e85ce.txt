Average.
He learns Italian.
More time was spent touring italy and drinking cappucino than pursuing justice or fighting bad guys.
What bothered me most was that very little actually happened.
Three Stars.
Joel goes to cafes.
But not Great.
I knew from Grisham's past works that his despicable protagonist would reform and overcome his problems.
I listened to the unabridged audio version of The Broker.
He falls in love with a woman, and avoids bad guys.This was a good book, but its hardly a four star effort.
He hangs out with his tutors.
And while I enjoyed I found it to be an average read.
It might be nice if it were labeled a 'cozy' mystery.
And the Broker was no exception.
He eats food I cannot even name.

My doctor could not believe it.
I felt better after 2 weeks.
I'm convinced that it works.
I was getting sinus infections every few months.
If I maintain these results next time we will start reducing the medications.
I rarely felt well enough to exercise and my glucose and cholesterol started to shoot up.
All my blood readings were back in normal.
My HDL/LDL ratio was much better.
In addition I lost 5 pounds.
3 months ago I started this diet.
Eventually I was taking medications for both the glucose and cholesterol but they were still too high.
I was concerned about the cholesterol but when I went last week for my blood test my cholesterol was cut in half.
My glucose was cut in half.
I have been fighting allergies for 12 years with little success.
I was able to start regular exercise again.
Allergists never could pin down what was causing the problem.

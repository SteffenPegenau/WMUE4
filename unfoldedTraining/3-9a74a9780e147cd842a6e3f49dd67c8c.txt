Very sweet book!
Haven persona & wanting to "fix" all the wrongs (ie, caring for her mom, her feelings)3.
I was actually Team Sumner until ......
Most of us have probably thought about that at least once ;)What I did not love:1.
The ex ... Sumner.
For real?
The dad leaving mom for a younger model ..... Not cool.
As a Dessen fan, this was not my favorites but true to her writing, it's very descriptive and colorfully written.
Hitting the costumer with a shoe, LOL!
The sisterly bond between Haven and Ashley.2.
The last chapters!It's a pretty predictable YA read ... Enjoyable, but a bit foreseeable.
I loved Haven' s character.What I loved:1.
That whole wedding/relationship/pregnancy just screamed unfair.2.
He let me down.
Super quick read ....
Seriously ...

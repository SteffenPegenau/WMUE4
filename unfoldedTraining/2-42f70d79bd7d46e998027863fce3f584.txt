There's a lot of fine print you ned to read.
$20 is all you should spend on a Casio.
Secondly, if the battery did in fact last ten years, wouldn't you expect the watch to last at lest half as long?
I've always taken the utmost care of this watch, never took it swimming or diving.
Then, after the second year, the alarm stopped working.
I got this watch in 2007.
Stay away from this garbage.
Took it to a repair shop, they told me it'd cost $140 to fix.
Most I did with it was jog and go to work.
Turning on the backlight made the numbers disappear.
More than the price of the watch.
For two and a half years it worked wonderfully.
It's ben a waste of money.
First of all, the ten year battery doesn't actually last ten, or even five, years.
All in all, I would have been better off with a $20 Timex.
Or for something really good and flashy, I' get a seiko or citizen for a couple hundred bucks.

The drawings look very retro and show men in suits and ladies in dresses with hats.
But somehow the book seems even more outdated.
The authors could have done a better job of updating the material.
Give `Em What They Want was published in 2005.
I just googled the question.
All the information on who publishes your book is outdated because of that.
The post office first introduced self-adhesive Christmas stamps in 1974!
I'm right!
The clothes look like the late 1940's or the 1950's.
The text mentions typing and SASE's, including a mention of licking stamps.
That came after 2005.
Case closed.
This couldn't have been written later than the late 1970's, especially when it mentions that self-adhesive stamps were new at the time.
There is no mention of Amazon Kindle.
They couldn't be later than the early 1960's.

This book is more like 3 1/2.
Unfortunately, Tony is a sick, weak, broken man who is caught up in the image of Leigh, Jillian, and then Heaven and Annie.
It just seemed with age, Tony became more and more demented.
I skipped over a lot of passages, unfortunately.
I would have liked it more if Annie did not whine all the damned time!
She just got on my nerves and she was spoiled.
She was nothing like Heaven!
When Heaven hit hard times, she straightened her back and dealt with it.
Andrews fan, with the exception of her Wildflower series, I feel I have been generous with my rating.
She was virtually spineless!
This is not the man who helped toughen Heaven into an even stronger young woman.
I think I would have liked Annie as a protagonist IF she had a backbone, that's all!
But back to Annie.
All Annie did was complain and complain.
Well, since I am a Die Hard V.C.

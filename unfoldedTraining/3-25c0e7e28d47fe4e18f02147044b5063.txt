I've found I've made some sort of connection with Hornbacher.
Food became weird while I was reading.
I really was getting the feeling of what an eating disorder must be like.
I recommend it.
Normally I like to snack while I read, but I just couldn't do it reading this book.
Hornbacher really gets under your skin.
In short this book is scary and effective.
It's amazing how she was able to keep the bulimia covered for so long.
There must have been people I have known who were doing the same thing.
And I take the whole issue much more seriously than I did.
And then all of the ways of throwing up, and binge eating.
I want to know how she's doing now, and I wish there was some way I could find out what she's up to and how she is.
After reading the book, I can recognize things now.
This book is really creepy.
She also writes about anoretics strange relationship with food, strange ways of eating, and counting bites and measuring food.

All was well until recently.
I have four children, one of which the gate is for.
I installed it correctly and easily.
This is unsafe in my opinion.
Because I homeschool, this gate gets a lot of use and just isn't doing what it is suppose to.
I would not recommend for high traffic area and for saftey issues.
It swings close on one side but not the other as other reviews mentioned.
We have only had this gate 3 MONTHS!!
My 8 and 6 yr olds have no problem with using the gate and my 3 and 16 m old can not.
At first I loved it, especially the one hand swing close mechanism.
We moved past that, since I tightened it a bit more.
Not good since she thinks she can stand and walk up the last step.
Now I will have to replace it.
It looks great.
The problem lies within the bottom latch.
My 16M has made it to the stairs a few times and to the top of the stairs before we have gotten to her.
The first week my 3 yr old got a finger pinched trying to figure out the top latch.

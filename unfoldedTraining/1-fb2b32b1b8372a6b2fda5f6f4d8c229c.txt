I wasted (my money) on this.
I set it up to make a 1/4" box joint.
Spend it on a good one, like maybe a Freud or a Jesada.
I'm going back to my old Craftsman 7" wobble-head dado.
Tried the same thing set at 3/8".
Joint wouldn't fit right.
Could probably have done better with a chisel.
Turns out the dado is really about .42" wide.
The 8" Delta stacked dado is dismal.
The Delta may become an anchor for my boat.
Maybe it can do that right!
Don't waste your money on this.
You pay for what you get.
Further setups revealed the chippers are not a uniform diameter.
One of the outer blades is a larger diameter than the other, making a ragged bottom in the groove.

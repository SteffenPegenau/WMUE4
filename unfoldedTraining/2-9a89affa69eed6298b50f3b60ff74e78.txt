NOT Swiss - movement, made in Japan!
If it had truly been "Swiss-made" with a Swiss movement, the price would have been right.
.
.
CHEAP QUALITY!.
The watch I received was NOT worth as much as the "$395.00 List Price" Amazon represented.
I won't make that mistake again!.
.
.I feel that I was totally ripped-off by Amazon with false and/or misleading information.
The descriptor said "Swiss-made watch" but the watch I received definitely has a Japanese movement - NOT a Swiss-made movement.
The watch I received only has a retail value of about $199.00 - CHECKED AT A LOCAL MALL WATCH STORE!.
.This watch - while looking good - was misadvertised by Amazon.
.
But I evidently have no recourse to actually receive the quality of watch I expected as advertised from Amazon.. .
.This watch gains about 30 seconds per day, which is terrible for what was supposed to be a "quality" instrument.

I love this guy.
I love the darkness of his lyrics.
They're ALL good (and that's very unusual these days).
Sorry Obie.
Ok, Obie Trice is nice too.
All the beats are bangin.
All true to life street stories.
I really recommend you purchase (or downlaod, whatever) ALL of Royce's albums.
He's a very descriptive, well worded street reporter.
Royce is hotter than ANYONE Slim has released (that's including those untalent MTV whores in G-Unit).
OH WELL......Em's problem.
I simply cannot believe Eminem dropped him from Shady Records.
As usual, Royce has dropped ANOTHER banger.
Anyway....Royce is hot.
No bull**** club music here.

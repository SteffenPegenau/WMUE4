I guess being the same age as him is cool.
I am sure the music will be as great as the pictures are inside the cd.
I am like a number 1 fan of *NSYNC and O-Town and I am gonna become and number 1 fan of Richard.
Usually all the guys in music that I like are 4-9 years older than me.
He was really nice and cool to the fans.
For once there is a guy who is my age and he is so hot!!!
I just wish I could know a little about him and maybe even meet him.
I think that would be the best!!!
I wasted a lot of film on him.
I recently attened the O-Town concert in Philadelphia, PA and Richard Lugo was the opening act!!!
He is a really good artist and a great dancer.
I hope you enjoyed my comment and I strongly suggest that you go out and buy the cd tomorrow.
Not only is he a great singer and dancer, but he is so hot!!!
Maybe even Richard is reading this now.
lol
I am defintely going to buy the full cd tomorrow.

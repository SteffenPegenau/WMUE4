A Toatally black game system are the awesomest ever.The only bad one is the 40GB.
The PLAYSTAION 3 also plays standerd DVDs for extra awesomeness.And how they write PLAYSTAION 3 is awesome to.
Thats all I have to say.
Just like the Xbox 360 you can go online and hook up with friends.
And Instead 2player games how about 4player.
a'll write a sequel to this.
And the controller is awesome and is epsically for Wii lovers.
Get the 60GB or 80GB.
The games are BLU-RAY and also the movies.That probally Explanes the price.
P.S.
First how the PLAYSTAION 3 is awesome.
Used to go to the playstaion home.
Because they have more space.
And a new button playstaion sybol witch is the homing button.
Because you pull,Tug,drift and ,grab.Ok theres another awesome part BLU-RAY a full 1080p perfect pitcure.
And if I did'nt tell you this BLU-RAY also has more space for more bonus features.
Is how AWESOME it looks.

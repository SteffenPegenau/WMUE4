None of the others are!
Her hair has light green streaks.She wears a black shirt, green skirt, and green shoes.
In this set, Phoebe has long dark red/brown hair and green eyes.
Roxxi is her Twiin.
I might buy them because they are only ten dollars each.
Jade is my favorite Bratz!
If she did, her friends could wear the shoes, but they are black also!They only made three dolls in this set: Phoebe, Cloe, and Yasmin.
The shoes and feet snap on n' off.The only problem is that her legs are painted black!
They should make at least one set without her.
Jade and Sasha are not in this set, but I think they should be.
Why can't she just wear black tights?
I am sort of tired of so many Cloes.
Why is Cloe in EVERY set?
I don't have the I Candy Bratz but I want them.
That's a great price for a Bratz, and I don't care that they only have one outfit.Phoebe is one of the Twiins.

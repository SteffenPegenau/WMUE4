Ran home and loaded hoping to fight the villians of modern Russia.
The game loaded well enough, the opening screen provided one of the best cut scenes I have ever seen.
Regardless, nothing.
I was never able to get the actual game to play.
Excellant packaging, cool screenshots, interesting concept.
KA52 unfortunately collapsed in on itself.
My system far exceeded the minimums required, just nothing.
Oh and yes, I did buy another copy and the same thing occurred.
A waste.
Then POOF!
My best advice would be to save your $30 and invest in Gunship!.
Maybe they forgot the exe file.
it spit me right back out.
I bought the game.
That's it.

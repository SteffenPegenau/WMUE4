Come to think of it- I like more songs then I thought!
And looking at the picture inside is worth the price of the whole cd- trust me.
Pretty much all the songs on this cd are about s-e-x.
PLEASE DO.
You wanna kiss me Adam??
He definately was thinking of the girls when he wrote the songs on this album- so guys maybe shouldn't bother.
Personally I could listen to Navel To Neck everyday for the rest of my life and not get sick of it.
There are a few songs I skip past.
Puss N Boots is a fun song and everybody knows Strip.
This is not Adam's best cd- but it is pretty good.
Wait.
And I like Vanity and Playboy as well.
If you havent heard Navel To Neck and you are a girl who thinks that Adam was as hot as they come- then you will ENJOY this song.
GEEZ he has a sexy voice.
I do reccomend it.

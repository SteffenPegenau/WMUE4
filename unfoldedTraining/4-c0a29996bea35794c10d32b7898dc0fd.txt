The multiplayer is only on Live though.
The detail on the weapons was extradinary.
There are tons of weapons too.
I have just returned the game back to blockbuster.
It was primarily used as stuff like &quot;Holy H*ll that is a big monster.&quot; Also there is a little sidekick robot who is very stupid and funny.
The actual levels were a little dull, I didn't really even notice.
The audio on the actual person you are playing and the enemies is very realistic.
I very much enjoyed the game.
But there is however quite a bit of cussing, but it was never used offensivly.
If you like fast-paced fps's, you'll be sure to like this one.
I would, for sure, buy the game.
I was at points a little scared.
Overall, I think that it was a very good game, for only $39.99 at other stores.
The audio was amazing with the backgrond music making you just a little scared.
He is very clueless, he made me laugh a bit.

Beautiful costumes, beautiful settings, adequate acting.
There is so much artistic license that at times I think that the writers have no sense of the spirit of Emma at all.
The characters are not true to their literary nature.
But as a televisions adaptation of Emma by Jane Austin I am simply shocked that this program has received so many good reviews.
Then the Director.
I could go on criticizing but I actually don't enjoy putting the creative efforts of others down.
If you are looking for Emma you won't find her here.
The writers are primarily at fault.
If you are looking for an entertaining period drama this is great.
Why?
The story does not adhere to the book.
As a adaptation of Emma by Jane Austin I wish I could give it a zero... a one star had to suffice.
Then the primary actors... in that order.
For an average television production this is adequate.
If this were any old period flic I would give it a three star rating.

I don't break down individual songs, but even if I did I couldn't do it with this mix cd.
If you are looking for radio's top 20 type of rap this is not for you.
You will not be disappointed.
Why?
THIS IS HIP HOP!
The mix cds he dropped before his Def Jam release were excellent, but this one is on a higher level.
Once again, BUY IT!
This is a man letting it all go, you can feel the pain, thoughts and truths in every line.
I know it is old, but it's never too late to wipe the crust from your third eye.
Very few could relate to it or understand it.
Because every track is spectacular.
GET THIS CD!
Now, his release on Def Jam was decent, but it did not do him justice.
The reason I am giving this review now is because I listened to it again for the first time in months and I am more impressed than the first fifty or sixty times I listened to it.
I bought the mix cd a year ago and it did not take me long to grasp how "NICE" Joe Budden is.
Incredible, incredible, incredible.

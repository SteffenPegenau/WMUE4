"Chainey Do" is another funky, hypnotic, song that will keep you moving.
This CD is worth buying for "Betcha Got a Chick On the Side" alone.
"Save the Bones for Henry Jones" is campy fun, and would not sound out of place on a Bette Midler album.
The other show stopper on this CD is "Going Down Slowly".
Again just 7 minutes of pure, unadulterated funk-disco bliss!
Much cheaper also!
Another jazzy number is the tribute to Duke Ellington.
"Sleeping Alone" has nice vocal harmonies, but not much else.
The rest of the album, while quite good, can be bland at times.
It amazes me that this song isn't more well known.
The vocals are stunning, and the beat is funky as hell.
It sure beats the hell out of the 80's junk they put out.
It does sound out of place on this album though.
Better to buy the Blue Thumb compilation CD, it has "Betcha..." and "Going Down..." in their entirety, as well as standouts from all of their Blue Thumb releases.
It is 7 minutes of pure funk.

And 4- Super K.I.T.T.
David Hasslehoff returns as Michael Knight...
(By plastic surgery of course!)
- even more cool... Plus R.C.
Is cool...I also wanted to comment that another review I read by someone here thought Season 2 had Goliath Returns... Not true... That was season 3... Good try though...
-JM
Plus Michael VS. Garth Knight - Evil twin brothers indeed!
A tale of Irony...
I was critical about the series losing Bonnie for April, but I give it three and a half stars which Amazon.com doesn't allow, because of David Hasslehoff's Double role in the 2 part Goliath!
3- Bonnie returns!
VS. Semi - How cool is that?!
I am a slacker!
YES!
Wilton Knight's son Garth is the real son, and Michael is the son he always wanted.
I have official complete series print out, but not updated in my computer files to share yet, sorry, only Season 1...
Season 2 suffered a bit...
Season 3 & 4 gets 4 stars!
K.I.T.T.
(Forgive me?)

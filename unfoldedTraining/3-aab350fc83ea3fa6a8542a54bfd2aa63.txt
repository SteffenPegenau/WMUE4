I was hoping for a cookbook that had a lot of recipes I could use.
There is a difference.
With this being a CLEAN eating book......the recipes were not overly appetizing.
I may be wrong.
I CAN eat spelt, not wheat.
If your problem is JUST wheat...it might not be an issue, if it is gluten, don't eat spelt!
I don't believe this was written by a person who has celiac or is lactose intolorant.
To touch on the dairy free wheat free examples.
So, it is to detoxify your body.
My husband CAN'T have any gluten.
Always check with your dr.....
Unfortunately there were very few in here that the average person would eat.
It appears to be an eating your way clean, which is what the title says.
I'd give better examples, but I gave it away to a friend.
It does have stickers in the cookbook to ask to replace the whey with soy products and spelt can be tolorated by many people who can't have wheat.
I was looking for a gluten free/dairy free cookbook.

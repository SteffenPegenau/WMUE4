Real entertainment here, folks.
the worst thing about this film is the footage of the REAL live cat fed to the room full of starving rats.
The few moments that show "gore or violence" are very weak, poorly shot, and the effects were cheap.
I had read all the hype about this film.
Very boring.
You have no idea what a disappointment this DVD was.
There is one slightly nauseating scene involving an autopsy of a supposed REAL corpse.
This was out of place and totally unprofessional of the "film makers".
Later the same rats are set on fire.
And I use that term loosely.
For real.
You could see much more violent and disturbing things by randomly picking ANY horror film from the shelf at the video store.
If you are interested in the true war crimes of Unit 731 go read a book.
How shocking and disturbing it was.
Still I've seen worse footage of surgeries on the Discovery channel.
Gore hounds like myself will be severly dissapointed.

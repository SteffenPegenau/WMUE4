"Gosh!
"...these are supposed to be funny?
There is no plot.
Just don't say I didn't warn you!
Come on, Bob Dylan's about 1,000,000 times funnier than whoever wrote the script for this album, and Dylan doesn't even write comedy for a living!Anyway, this is really really bad.
Argh!If you want REAL funny stuff, go with the Simpsons, Monty Python & the Holy Grail, or classic Dylan albums.
There is a reason why this got such bad review from the press, people!
What has the film industry become?
No.
Maybe it's supposed to be bad, like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes?
This is ridiculously bad.
"Flippin' Sweet!"
It's bad!And now kids are walking around with Napolean Dynamite t-shirts and quoting it at every possible opprotunity.
And the jokes... "Bow to your sensei!"
"Vote for Pedro!"
If you want mindless drivel, this is your outlet!
Definetly no.
"Give me some of your tots!"
So here we have it: one of the worst films of all time.

Your Woman.
Your Baby.
To her life situations.
A stong unfailing love.
Although she is not a prisoner in an institution, she is a prisoner of it.
Your King.Rashid: You keep loving Asha.
I cannot in anyway compare myself to Asha.
Your Man.
Your Momi.
I praise her for being able to tell her story and weather the storms.
With the ability to accept love and give love in return.Asha: You keep loving Rashid.
A man who is not ashamed to love.
Able to face his mistakes and keep moving in a positive way without the hinderance of the past but with a stregnth from it.
Faltering at times nevertheless bearing it and telling it.Rashid, the man of what all men should be.
Your Queen.May the strength of your love keep you and see you through to the end.
If only we all could find a love like this.

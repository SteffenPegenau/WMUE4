LOL
The gay jokes were light hearted but I can see why people are so sensitive about it.
This movie was the best!
Wow!
Oh, and if you have seen the movie already, this next line was indeed long awaited and I'm glad that Kevin convinced Mark Hamill to say it: "Don't fluck with the Jedi Master!"
He borrowed from the best and improved on the bad.
SB only talks like twice in the whole movie but as always, he shows his underlying intelligence.
That is all I have to say.
Kevin Smith has outdone himself this time.
WOW!
Well, we ALL thought it was about time for him to get some, so why not let it be Shannon Elizabeth?
And J?
:) So in conclusion, Rock on, Kevin Smith!
I personally think they were great and totally in character for the dynamic duo J & SB.
May the Movie Force be with you!

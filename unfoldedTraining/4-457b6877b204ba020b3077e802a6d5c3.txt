Then out of the dark you materialise behind the enemy and blow him away !
NOW THAT WAS A GAME!!!
This is not only the worst star trek game since "APPLE TREK" (on Apple 2 E computer,,,anyone remember that??)
What you are given is a lame shuttlecraft that weakly blasts the big starships with a laughable phaser and torpedo effect!!
but also the worst x-box game ever to foul my laser!!!!
!
Imagine the fun of a cloaking shield!!!
WHY DID THEY EVEN BOTHER to make this game!!
!BUT THIS!!!!
PLEASE DONT BUY THIS GAME AND TEACH THE DEVELOPERS A LESSON!!P.S.
!Like many I was hoping this would be similar to the old SNES star trek academy game where you could choose a starship and go against other ships from the tv and movie series!!
the tech tv series X-PLAY gave it 1 out of 5 as well haha!
THIS TRAVESTY is the saddest effort I have ever seen!!!
You could play against another person as well which rocked!!
You dont get to control the big ships!!

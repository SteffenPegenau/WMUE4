YES.
So say we all!
Not me!
Not much time and effort was spent on details with this one.
I love the original and Im fascinated by RDM's BSG.
NO, just rent it and save $20!!
!
Do you go see it?
Should you buy it to see it?
It explains things-rather very simply- and it does it without fanfare.
!But I wont delve deep into the Plan either.
They are all rather simple explanations to a very deep and intriguing story from the minisries.
let me keep it nice and simple: Its a good companion DVD to the miniseries and the TV series, Plain and simple, It has very little depth, very little character development so all it does is fill in the holes from Season 1-2 thats all.
Plain and simple!
or why Boomer shot the 'old man'.
So all that the Plan does is it narrates and explains things we were all curious about.
Im a BSG fanatic from when I was 9 years old!!
like how Shelly godfrey disappeared even with TWO colonial marines on her tail!
So Im never gonna bash BSG-NO!!

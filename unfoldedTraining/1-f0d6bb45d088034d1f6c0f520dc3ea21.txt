I am not going to be critical of the author.
This is anything but that.
I would like amazon to refund my money or send me a $10.00 credit for a different book.
I am not ignorant and consider myself a well read person.
Anyone who has the discipline to write fiction and get it published deserves credit for their accomplishment.
If your looking for thrilling, thoughtful, compelling, gutsy science fiction pick up Heinlein or Asimov, not this.
My problem is how it was marked.
I was not looking for christian fiction.
I skimmed it I tried to read the last chapter and it made no more sense than it did when I read the first.
This is my first time.
It is clearly christian fiction, which is a good thing.
I was looking for good old fashion science fiction.
Please move this to christian fiction where it belongs not in the science fiction genre.
I picked up the book over ten times.
I have never in my life commented on a book.

I love everything with the exception of the bad version of Auld Lang.
This disc might be the last one to take you on such a journey...at least from this artist.
I love the song Blue Eyes.

I love this CD.
How can any song do that you ask?
It's more than smooth.
It just doesnt fit.

Enjoy it.
I have never gotten so into a CD as i was with this.

I have the cheesy 70's material from him, and it pales immensely next to this music.
Listen to this one and find out for yourself.
It's slick and very sexy.
It makes me feel like i'm standing under a waterfall.

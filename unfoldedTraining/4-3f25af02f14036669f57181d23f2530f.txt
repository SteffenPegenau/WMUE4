I like more, but these are really good.
None of my friends like it either.
Vanessa Hudgens is a pretty girl with an Ok voice.
So stupid and lame and kidish.
That was a bad move.Parents: JUST BEWARE OF THAT.
But on some songs, she just sounds whiney and nazel!
Let down your hair, the h**l who cares..."I don't know why Vanessa would say that.
Along with RATHER BE WITH YOU, they're the best.In " Let Go," she says and I quote, " 'Cause at my best and at my worst, yea, you've already seen it.
It is horrible!
Probably millions of kids will buy this and she says that.
I doubt anyone will like it!
If you liked her in High School Musical, you should like her in the CD....
DRIVE and NEVER UNDERESTIMAT A GIRL are my two faves.
Just DUMB MOVE VANESSA!!!!
OTHERWISE, IT'S A PRETTY GOOD CD!I recomade it.
The absulte WORST song on here was PHYSIC.

"Looking For A New Love" became a theme song for many liberated minded ladies.
Tattoed.
80's Diva.
;)
Funky, funky, funky!
Look, Jermaine Stewart wrote a song about this gal.
Cool.
Meanwhile, live life!
"Still A Thrill" is organized chaos, with thumping velocity bass, reverse gated effects, and a heroin sheik style vocal track.
Coupled with former Prince bass player Andre Cymone, they crank out some nasty grooves on this CD.
She is on to something.
Sexy.
Check her out.
Never failed to pack a dance floor at a club on lady's night.
Of course my favorite is "Don't you want me," an infectious dance mix that will help you get your groove back.

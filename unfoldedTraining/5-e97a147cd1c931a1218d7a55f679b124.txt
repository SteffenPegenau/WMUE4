If you have not read this book, I encourage you to do so.
We should not limit Him to what we think He is capable of.
God works in miraculous ways and who knows that this book might be what helps lead someone to Him.
This will happen.
God is using people like Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins through these novels.Trust me, read one and you will be hooked.
Oh, yes, not give this to non-believing friends?
Should we change that to take away its predictability?
Thank you for reading and God bless.
I thought.
I noticed some other reviews that mentioned it was too predictable.
Tell a few friends.
I cannot wait for The Assassins!
I thank God I will not be one of those people.
Hello!
This book begs for you to answer the simple question, "Will you be left behind?"
Those not prepared will be left behind.
I simply loved Left Behind and went on to read the other 4 books out so far.
God shows us (not necessarily very clearly) what will happen in the future.

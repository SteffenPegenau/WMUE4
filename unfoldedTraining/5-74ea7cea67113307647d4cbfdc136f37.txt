This book is for the strange, the goth and the disturbed.
The lines are slightly jagged, giving it that diary-of-a-phsyco look (perfect for me ;) ).
Yay!
This journal is recomended for children.
Great for all you sharpie lovers.
First of all, I must state that I am biased.
Another plus: the paper is extra thick.
No bleeding!
The spot art throughout is very nice, very Emily.
Emily may be young, but she is no child.
This journal is wonderful.
One complaint...though.
I always have.
That being said, lets get to the review.
Anything Emily, I will most likely fall in love with.
I love Emily.

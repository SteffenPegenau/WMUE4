The description makes it sound like it is told from Daisy's point of view, but really it is not.
She was content to just exist for the moment.
It was not depressing, I just felt sorry for her.
With Daisy it was like she knew she would never been remembered, so why try.
It almost like an outsider wrote it that knew everything about Daisy.
She even felt her children and grandchildren would eventually forget about her.
Thankfully you get a few clips of the story told from varying viewpoints.
While I liked the book, I felt next to nothing for Daisy herself.
I'm not sure really what to think of this book.
I found those surrounding her to be far more interesting.
Still, not a bad story.
Most people I think go through life trying to make their mark, something that says they were here long after they're gone.
I got the most from the letters, etc that are throughout the story.
I kept hoping the Daisy would eventually find something to tie her to this world.
They gave the story life.

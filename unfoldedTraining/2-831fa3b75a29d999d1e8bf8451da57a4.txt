After 5 minutes I could no longer keep my feet in the water they were burning!
When you put the rollers in the bottom it lifts your feet up so only the bottom of your foot in in the water (but it still burns like crazy!
However it should be HOTTER than you can handle spa!
I was really booking forward to getting this product.
It is really expensive, but I thought I will try it because I really need something for me feet.
The title of the product is pretty good, Hot Spa.
It does heat the water.
Also the water jets work great until you put your feet in.
It say's not to use for longer than 20... right.
The problem is there is no thermostat so the water continues to heat!
It's not much of a treat if you have to keep pouring out water and putting in cold and still can only use it for 5 minutes.
Then it's just a few bubbles and the top water gets submerged so you really don't feel anything.
I stand at work all day.
First you have to be able to keep your feet in.
DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY.

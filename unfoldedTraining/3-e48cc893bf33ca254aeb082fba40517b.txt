It's not bad, but it's not great either.
Her voice is so weak!
Hope this helps!
The chick that plays Christine is just not cut out for the part.
The instruments are average, nothing wow but they sound fine.
And our Phantom?
So, being the Phantom Phreak that I am, I had to buy this.
She can't hit the proper notes and she just sounds rather unpleasant.
His voice is much too high.
His voice is a lot deeper than most other performers, but it's a nice change.
Don't be fooled by the other reviews on this item!
Raoul sounds like a woman.
I would definately not spend $50.
I would suggest maybe buying forom an amazon seller and not from amazon itself, their price is much too high for this recording.
He's not bad.
I got mine brand new through caiman.com, who is still a current amazon seller.

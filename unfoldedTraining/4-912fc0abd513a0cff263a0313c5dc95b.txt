oh, well.
after that it, i just held the top and it worked plenty well.
since then, i've juiced 44 limes.
yes, that's what the suction cups are doing.
it appears that the clips are broken.
i think that it doesn't really need them, anyway.i am pleased with it.
i just bought this about an hour and one half ago.
also, i wouldn't leave an electric juicer out on my counter.
why so many complaints?
this i shall.one complaint is that it comes with a plastic platten set for juicing softer (non citrus) fruits like tomatoes and berries, it is supposed to clip in somehow to the device.
yes, it is asymmetric.
compared to electric juicers, this was trivial.
as far as force required, it seemed pretty easy to me.
the first time i did it, it tipped.
no spilling, just a tip and a little splash.
that does put a moment on it.
cleaning was ridiculously simple.

I am now hesitant between discarding it,keeping it, and giving it away.
It sounds like from third-grade soap opera that you happen to encounter when turning the channels on TV.
He plays as if he is obliged to deliberately show off.
Nothing falls near spontaneous or natural.
I wish I could give it 5 stars.
Ave Maria is too bad in particular.
I usually likes his performance.
I have never heard it played with so much vibrato as it is here.
He deserves one this time.
Because music appreciation is very subjective.
There is hefty strain on the melody line.
And no sorry here.
Ave Maria here is not the Ave Maria from Schubert.
I cannot,though.
If that is the way you love it played on Ave Maria, then this disk is for you.

* The music is not that good.
* You don't get TO excited by the sequences and the story like in Grandia 1.
* The characters don't follow you when you are walking (they get inside you).
* It doesn't have to much fun like in Grandia 1.P.S: At least this game is MUCH better than that STUPID, HORRIBLE and DISSAPOINTIG game called Grandia X!!!
* To many CG cinematics and the animation is SUPERB!
* The characters desing is like anime.
* BEAUTIFUL and realistic graphics.
* You can fly an airplane to get to the stages instead of just jumping into the map like in the prequels.
* The characters desing is NOT SOOO COOL as in Grandia 2.
If you want a better version of Grandia X then you should buy this game.Adios.
* Good intro with cool female rock music.
Pros:* COOOL and FAST new combo fights.
The Grandia battle system is still the best!!!
* Touching story and sequences.Cons:* The powers are NOT AWESOME AND COOL as in Grandia 2.
* Good voice acting.

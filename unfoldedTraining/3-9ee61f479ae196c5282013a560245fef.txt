I like Gary barlow because of his lyrics and his voice but this latest album of his is a bit bland.
Come on Gary, I know that you can be more creative than this.
Sorry Gary but I write all this based on my honest musical view.
If he was one of the spice gerrs, he would be geri harliwell and Robbie williams ,Melanie C. Robbie is doing very well because of his choice of music.
Do justice to your talent!
Better buy his singles intead of the whole album.
Fast car could have been a good song but the chorus is totally anti-climax... so damn boring!
I only like less than half of his tracks.
You;re very talented.
Yesterday gerr is very boyzonish... 2 thumbs down.
To be your life and hero is catchy and one of the stronger tracks.
The video clip is cool as well.
But i personally love your lyrics.
But I must admit that STRONGER is a strong single indeed.
Be stronger next time!

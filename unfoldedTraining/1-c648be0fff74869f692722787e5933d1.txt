He also ends up in mental challenges as well as physical, such as a riddle contest with Gollum, a creature from the sea.
The Hobbit is down right boring.
I strongly recommend that you do not read this book.
The last few chapters about facing the dragon Smaug, are very hard to follow.
It's hard to follow and is extremely dumb.
I think that J. R. R. Tolkien did a terrible job of tying the book together.
Warning: Don't read this book.
It'll scare you from reading any other book The Hobbit stinks.
Suddenly, he is left with a band of dwarves, who take him on an adventure.
To tell the truth, I probably don't know how it ends.
Unless you want to be bored to death, do not read the famous The Hobbit.
All he worries about is that he left his handkerchief at home.
The Hobbit is terrible.
While he faces evil orcs, goblins, and wolves, he gains the respect of the other dwarves with the help of a magic ring.
It faces in on Bilbo Baggins, a lonely hobbit.

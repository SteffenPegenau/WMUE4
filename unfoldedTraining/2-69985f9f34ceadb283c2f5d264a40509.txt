I had to jack down all the settings to make it perform even so-so.
Flight Sim X with great expectaions of improvements from the 2004 version.
Im not sure what kind of system is needed to play this game with decent graphics, but I can't find one.
I was VERY disappointed at the performance.
I can currently play pretty much any game on the market with no problems and good performance with decent frames rate.
Turning performance settings WAY down helps, but does not completly cure the issues.
I purchased Micro.
Install was flawless, other than activation.
Buyer Beware..
He actually has a very expensive video card, with same results.
I installed it on a gamer friends system, with the same results.
Both of our systems WELL EXCEED requirements for the SIM.
Flight graphics very choppy and sluggish.
THIS SIM is BAD.
I have 2 high powered machines (Intel D core, 2GB Ram, PCIExp 256MB video).

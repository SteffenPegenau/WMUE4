Warm3.
Wind resistant6.
It also runs short.2.
They will provide no warmth in the winter.3.
Lot of jacket for the money5.
Nylon lined sleeves keep shirt sleeves from riding up when putting the jacket on4.
Attached hood can get in the way
I bought this and the Arctic lined jacket at the same time.
Quality zipperCons:1.
This jacket is a great value.
The external Duck fabric is tough but not rough.
Other than the lining, both jackets are exactly the same.
As another reviewer noted, the front hand pockets are small and unlined.

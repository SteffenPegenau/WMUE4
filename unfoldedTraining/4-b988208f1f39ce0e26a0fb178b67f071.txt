But when it does, you are there.
Special to me are Shadow of a Doubt, (Heart) of Soul, Heartland Truckstop, Shopping Trolley and A Place Aside.
I think I love each and every song in its own way.
Personal tastes are just that.
WOW.
It adds great flavor to the drink of life.
Where to start?
Beth Orton is so stripped-down, uncovered and real (at all times, not just this CD) that I feel like I'm taking up space on this planet.
The songs individually are excellent, but fit together even better.
I'm not sure.
I just can't choose one.
It's really special to feel like you're experiencing the evolution and growth of an artist along with them.
It's stripped down, earthy and even has a lit grit in - like it was just picked fresh from a garden.
As noted by earlier reviews, this CD takes a few listens to absorb into your system.
Thanks to Jim O'Rourke for helping bring out this new twist on Beth.

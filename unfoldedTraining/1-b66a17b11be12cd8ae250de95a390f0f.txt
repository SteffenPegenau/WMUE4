It was like Dickinson planted a bad seed.
Iwouldnt play frisbee with Tatooed Millionaire.....
I am a huge Maiden fan but this solo effort by Bruce was a bad, bad dream.
When Tatooed millionare came out, I was there on day one.
these are all dreadful tunes and Im sure I have forgotten the rest by now.
I find this to be one of the worst albums of all time (category unnessary).
He killed the dark mystique of Iron Maiden in that one upchuck of glam trash rock.
Iron Maiden hasnt made a decent album since the one before Bruce made this album (seventh son).
Zulu Lulu??
Steve Harris and Paul Di Anno had to be laughing somewhere.
It is because of this album that I never bought another Bruce Dickinson album.
Born in 58??
At the time I was craving new Maiden material.
Yes, the first song (son of a gun)is decent but the rest of the album is for the trash.
Lickin the gun??

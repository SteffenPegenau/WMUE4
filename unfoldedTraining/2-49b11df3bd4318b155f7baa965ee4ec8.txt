There are other bugs as well; I cannot run my train in snow for example, I get a window asking me if I want to send this error to Microsoft.
My system crashed within 5 minutes.
But a game this expensive should not be shipped with such blatant bugs.
Hmmm.
Then the program shuts down.
It seems to me, that based on the minimum system requirements, my machine should handle this well.
I love trains.
So, I play this game with the settings turned down and without the full array of options.
I went into the settings and turned down the video to poor quality.
I rebooted and it crashed again.
Buy it if you love trains, though.
And I have fun.
I was excited about getting this game.
Now it doesn't crash.
I installed it on my 800 Mh, 256 meg Ram machine and started playing.

Sure it has truths to it that society should address.
Even the so called smash hit "Little Girl" Sure I cried the first time I heard it.
Like I said 10 times maybe.
I know he felt strong about it but he should make better choices of what he wants to record if he wants to keep his old fans like me.
But not on my stereo.
It has a good message that needs to be heard.
He needs to get a brand new life besides music.
"Lifes a Dance" "I Love the Way You Love Me" I saw him up close "10 feet" in small clubs before anybody new who he was.
It is a very depressing song.
I was crazy about him.
But I could listen to this song 10 times max.
Then hang it up.
There is nothing new here and very boring indeed.
As far as a hit with staying power give me a break.
I'm Sorry But.
I Started listening to John when he first came out.
Ever since then he has not had the original magic and if he thinks he is brand new I have awful bad news for him.
First three albums that is.

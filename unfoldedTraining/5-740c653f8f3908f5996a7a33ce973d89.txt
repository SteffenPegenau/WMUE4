I'm going to order another Kindle.
I've read between 15 and 20 novels on my Kindle, and I have become a fan of this e-reader.
No.
Do I need another?
However, I have gone past age 65, and collecting doesn't motivate me as much as it used to.

Yes.
I have always been comfortable in my room with my four bookcases and my collections of favorite authors.

It's mezmerizing!
(The process of clicking to purchase a book and then watching the download to my Kindle fascinates me.

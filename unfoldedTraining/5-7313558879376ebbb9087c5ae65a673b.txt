.
We are living in a transitional time of paradigm shifting .
What i dont like about it is that for theology, it lacks foundation .
Thank you O'Murchu.

.
It is after all theology which tends to be difficult to get through when scholarly.
But i gave it five stars because of its audacity and unique approach.
What O'Murchu offers is another lens to look at the world and the cosmos that every bit as valid as those more rigid sources.
.is a bit wishy washy.
admittedly a tough read, and i can see why the empircally linearly minded have great difficulty with it.
.
we need the fresh insights that can be gleaned from those scholars who think and write outside the box.
many disciplines attest to that .

You bet'cha!
Spinal reallignment up your arse from the Brokebackstreet Boys!
Another fine effort by chiropratic T Jocks McEntire'd', Herndon and (insert names here).
No.
Musicologists will study this album for years.
Thrill Jockey?
The entire Chicago crew needs to evolve their sound if they expect anyone to care.
Ambient?
But on a serious note I recommend this album to all those who wish they too lived in Chicago and have attained intellectual superiority.
These are fine artists playing in the shallow end of the pool they have excavated.
Melodic?
Wanna be on their next album just move to Wicker Park and stop bathin'.
The bes' thing since Shepards Pie, Mates!
Hmmm.
Prepare to succumb to the triple bass assault of Dougy, Joshua, and Noel.

Radiohead is just a phase, it'll grow old quickI don't know.
Guitars are overdubbed(3 guitars is a bit too much, don't you think?).
The futuristic sound is totally awesome!.
Thom Yorke acts like a Kurt Cobain, which is annoying.
They need better guitarists: Ed 'O brian and jon greenwood are overrated.
While it's a glimpse of what music might be in the future, it takes careful listening.
Buy it and see what you think
Here's my opinion on the albumPros.
Thom Yorke's lyrics are ok, but it could use more participation from all members.
It's futuristic sound and interesting riffs were pretty cool.
When I bought radiohead's ok computer, it offered everything it promised, which is rare from an album.
The album is the most overhyped album that i've ever heard.
The music is like a tribute to some other bands, it's just too ripped off.
Thom Yorke's singing is really, really, really annoying.
I can sometimes relate to the lyrics after a hard day's workCons.

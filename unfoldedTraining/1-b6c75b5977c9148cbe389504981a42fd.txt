All his other albums are grade A trash.
This guy talks about the same thing over and over and over.
Just to think this guy is considered to a great.
His subject matters are so tiring, not to mention his flow is terrible.
I will say this, "Reasonable Doubt" was his best album and even that wasn't a classic, but it did come close.
Yes I said it.
Will somebody please fill me in on what is so great about Jay-Z.
Period.
This album is straight trash!
"The Black Album" was a descent album worthy of about 3.5 to 4 stars.
This a horrible album by an extremely average rapper.
Blueprint was a solid album worthy of about 4 stars.
Don't make me laugh.
If you want some real emcees check out this people: 2Pac, Nas, Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Eminem, Big L, Outkast, and Jadakiss just to name a few.
It makes my head hurt.
I mean I just don't get it .

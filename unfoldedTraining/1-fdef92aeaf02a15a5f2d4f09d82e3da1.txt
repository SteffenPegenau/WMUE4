But now it's going in the junk pile.
Peter Noone is hardly recognizable, and I could swear that on some tracks that he is not even the lead singer.This is a major disappointment.
Oh, the songs are nicely done and all, but if you want the original hit recordings, then this is NOT the CD to buy.There are no liner notes.
But they are definitely not.BEWARE!
BEWARE!
These are NOT the original recordings!
BEWARE!
You can tell after listening to about 3 seconds of each cut.
They are all re-makes, that appear to have been done much later.
There is no indication that these are not the original recordings.
Only track listings.
All of the 21 tracks on "No Milk Today" are re-makes.
BEWARE!
I bought this CD because it had a nice selection of tracks and complemented my other Herman's Hermits CDs.
They are not alternate takes and they are not live takes.

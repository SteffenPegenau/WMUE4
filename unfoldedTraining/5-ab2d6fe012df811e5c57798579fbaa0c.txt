What can I say?
IT's a great product!
I then formatted the drive using the software included and got it working.
I originally upgraded my firmware to UMS, but for some reason I decided to change it back.
I'm now using the iriver music management software.
The buttons seem to be sturdy, along with the whole thing.
I recieved it a few days later, today.
I'm very impressed, it's a GREAT product.
I got the wrong firm ware and really messed it up.
I've already dropped it a few times and it's just absolutely great.
DO NOT hesitate to buy this!I hope this helped, honestly.
So far, I've got about 20 songs at 128-250 bit rate quality.
I bought this item off of ebay for $47 shipped.
I'm very impressed.
It's small, compact, and.. perfect.
I honestly don't know what to say.
I bought this as my first player and decided to use it for school, home, walking, bike rides, etc.

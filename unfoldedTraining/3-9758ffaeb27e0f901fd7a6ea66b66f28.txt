Some believers are killed.3.
The GC oppresses the believers.2.
One of the spiritual leaders gives a lecture or sermon about the grace of God.6.
This novel took me forever to get through.
Woo-Hoo!
Repeat.It just got old after a while.
I have now completed the entire original left behind saga.

I read constantly, usually finishing a book in three or four days.
Miracles happen sparing some lives, and those are ignored by the GC.4.
And it was an OK novel, just not one of their best efforts.T
As I started reading this series I was drawn in to the character and the storyline.
But alas, I finally finished it.
The GC commits war crimes against innocent civilians.5.

I'm afraid that Fallen is going to be the only succesful album from Evanescene.
I could claim that mine is just as nice as hers.
Nightwish's Tarja's voice is just so beautiful.
I expected a lot from this record, so I was dissapointed after I listened to it.
They have a lot of potential.
Try them; you won't be dissapointed!
They are just pretty overrated.
There are few good tracks on "Fallen".
I personally like "Going Under" and "My Immortal" very much, even though radio stations world wide have raped them, but the music doesn't touch my heart at all.
There are millions of singers like her.
All the songs are similar.
There are two European female fronted metal bands I find very professional and wonderful: Nightwish from Finland and After Forever from Holland.
But don't call Evanescence metal, because they aren't;).
She's a professional opera singer, btw.
I'm not saying Evanescence suck, because they really don't.
Amy Lee has a nice voice, but it's nothing special.

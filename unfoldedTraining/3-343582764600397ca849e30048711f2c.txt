We're thrown an occasional overplayed diva track-amber, dynamix, sandy B-but they become a shock because they don't fit in with the rest of the filler.

I wish the rest of the CD had lived up to the power of this instrumental hard house track.
Where as Manny Lehman did a dancer's body good with mostly peak anthems on disc 1, volume 4 is more for the crowd who wants to trip out so that boring music will seem more interesting.
But i must give him credit for using the track "The Ride."

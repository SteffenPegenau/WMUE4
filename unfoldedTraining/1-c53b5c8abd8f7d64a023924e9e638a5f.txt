Believe me, I wanted to like this!
At best!
And then... Where do I start?

This is a total rip off of your money and everyone involved in the making and promoting of this game should be ashamed of themselves.
You have been warned!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The graphics look like something from 10 years ago.
The game is clunky and old hat, with nothing to make you even want to explore the world.
And by far the worst offender is the ungodly voice acting.
Wow... Has there ever been a game so hyped that turned out to be this incredibly AWEFUL?
I love games and really wanted this to be good, but it's not even remotely passable.
I swear you have never heard anything as horrible and ridiculous as the dialogue in this game.
I was SO looking forward to this game.
Please do not buy this piece of garbage!
I am not one of thos muckrakers out there just looking for stuff to complain about.

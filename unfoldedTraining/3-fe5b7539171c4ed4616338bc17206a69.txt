Takeshi's voice acting is STILL too cool; he should sound more frightened, not angry.And I can't stand the line, "I'm not ready to die."
The children of arms often face near death situations.
They simply say "I don't wanna die", facing the fear of dying and realizing what it means to appreciate their lives.
Almost fan sub level.
Ryo's smart analysis of the enemy's strategy is also mistranslated and also simplified.
It's just "dust explosion".
Because of them, now, it's a different story that is full of cliche.
That's stupid.
Horrible translation for both sub and dub.
"Soldier's bomb"?
Was the translator sleeping in grade school science class?That's just an example.
But (in Japanese) they never say "I'm not ready to die!
"; they are not that heroic.
Wrong translation and horrible voice acting are all over the place.
Every child of arms is too wise or heroic in English, even Hayato is.

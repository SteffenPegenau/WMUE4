But i agree with other reviewsi read above that it should have been more puttogether.
More explained The things that happenare really scary.
It excites you cause you know the "thing"is doing this.
They go in a run down building andwhen they come out to leave, they're car doesntstart.
But the partthat confuses me is the ending.
I think this movie was really good.
So now they are stranded in the middleof a desert.
I loved the wholeidea of the movie.
When the family wakes up their car ismissing.
They decide to camp out in the run downbuilding.
You never see him though.
...
The nearest gas shop is 35 milesaway.
You can see from his eye pointof view and you can hear his breathing wheneverhe is on the screen.
The plot is a family goes into aghost town.

Is it too much to expect this product to work?
Terrific!
Seems like a good deal, right?
We are going to try again and I've ordered a replacement pair.
By the time we factor in all of the extra postage required for the returns and the forwarding this dual deal is hardly worth it.
Buyer beware.
Great!
And patient.
Now my folks have to repack and ship the defective unit to me.
1 for me, 1 for my folks in New England so they can see my daughter via the video phone.
The 2 pairs arrived to me in the Midwest.
I kept one and shipped the other to New England.
My folks and I set up our units only to discover their unit is defective and does not power up when plugged in.
I bought the "2 fer the price of 1" units.
I then have to re-repack it and send it with my working unit back to Amazon.
I guess I'm a sucker.

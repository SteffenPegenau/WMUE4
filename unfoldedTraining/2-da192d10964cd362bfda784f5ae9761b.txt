Not only has he changed spiritually, but vocally and in style.
And what is with his style?
On his "Welcome Back" vid, he wears what?
Sure, he went into the spirit thing, but man what happened?
And that was just a part of a song!
Now, after 5 years, everything changed.
I don't know what happened?
But the main question is if you should buy or not.
His vocals sound extremly weak in every song.
A dollar store T-Shirt and cheap partially ripped jeans?
Ma$e used to be a regular rap artist, just one of the best around.
It's really not worth it.
If you don't, forget it.
What was that?
If you own any Ma$e CD, just throw this in with your collection.
Really, something happened to this guy, and I know it had absoultely nothing to do with him being spiritual.
Who could forget his wonderful part in the song, "Mo Money Mo Problems"?

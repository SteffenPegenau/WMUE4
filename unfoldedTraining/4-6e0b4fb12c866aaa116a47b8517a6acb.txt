I'm glad that I haven't needed Cust Support.
I'm happy with the picture quality.
I researched extensively before purchasing.
I have run this TV almost 24/7 for 5+ years with little problem.
I've repaired the remote about 6 times once because I dropped it in a saltwater fish tank.
Tags are wrong, it is 720p NOT 1080i or 1080p
Surround sound solves that issue.
The HDMI works great and so does the composite input (COAX).
Every once in a while it looses it's mind (about every 6 months) I turn off, unplug and wait 10 minutes.
What else can I say the set has given me good service.
It is now taped but works fine.
I've used a Mitsubishi code for programming universal remotes.
I guess I got a lucky set.
Everything resets itself and good to go for another 6 months.
I just want to add that I purchased this Polaroid TV over 5 years ago.
The sound sucks but I knew that when I bought it.
Hope this helps someone.

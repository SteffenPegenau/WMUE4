Guess it could be viewed as close to real life in a depressing situation.
He has some great lines and he is what I enjoyed the most.
Lots of teen attitude.
Movie started with this attorney who hadn't been home to spend time with his family.
My husband and I were laughing about how the actress who played the wife had the best part.
OH to get paid to nap!
Sat down with my family to have an enjoyable evening watching a movie.
She got to play comatose the whole movie!
The movie started out bad and got worse from there!
Daughters didn't even know him.
I would not watch this movie again and I will be giving away the DVD.
Didn't help the movie at all.
It was completely UNNECESSARY!!
Second, very depressing film.
First, I was SHOCKED AT SOOOOO MUCH FOUL LANGUAGE !!!
I do have to say that in this downer of a movie there is the boyfriend Sid ( comes across a loser, but actually has some deep thoughts).
I really wanted to like this movie.

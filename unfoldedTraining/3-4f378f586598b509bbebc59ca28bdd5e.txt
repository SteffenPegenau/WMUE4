You're going to need Transcender in addition to this book.3.
This is totally unnecessary and gets incredibly old.
I'll cut right to the chase,Good points:1.
A heafty portion of this study guide covers information that isn't even part of what the exams cover.
The book's study questions are nothing like the actual exam questions.
Almost all of the topics needed for the exams.3.
It makes it much easier to research things.2.
400-500 pages are pretty much unnecessary to read.Summary: If you don't mind reading extra material, can handle the Microsoft bashing, and are planning to supplement your studies with Transcender, you will find this a great book.- Lawryll...
Great index.
They are much too easy.
Can't we all just get along?2.
The author also knows how to really dog on Microsoft.
The author knows how to present the material well.Bad points:1.
Please...stop the whining already.
Mostly great coverage of material discussed.

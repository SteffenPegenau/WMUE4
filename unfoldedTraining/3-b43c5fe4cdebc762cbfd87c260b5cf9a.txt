So I can't say she disappointed me in this film.
They are married but separated yet it is quite obvious they will be getting back together.
He does the most with what he's got.
Sarah Parker's acting efforts always leave me underwhelmed.
I can't say don't watch it because Grant is funny.
Nick Hornby was the writer on ABOUT A BOY though and he is first rate.
Hugh Grant, however, is a horse of a different color.
I thought she was so-so which is what I always think about her acting.
The premise is about a Manhatttan couple forced to hide out in the remote West in the witness protection program.
The screenwriter of this film is no Nick Hornby.
That's the whole movie.
He is a tremendous comic actor with exquisite timing.
His ABOUT A BOY is just one example of his performing at the top of his game.
When he's got a good script and a good leading lady, he is unbeatable.
The rest of the movie though is (thankfully) completely forgettable.

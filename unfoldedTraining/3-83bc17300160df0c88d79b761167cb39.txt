And there was a scene of him driving around Spurger and showed rows and rows of farmland.
We lived in, as my husband called it, the Fred/Spurger metroplex.
Spurger is mostly pine trees.
Fred was over the county line and a wet county.
My husband reminded me of the movie "Urban Cowboy".
I will give it a read and review it.
It is in the Piney Woods of East Texas.
The character played by John Travolta was from Spurger.
If you blinked, you would miss Fred.
I saw this on the free/inexpensive books for the Kindle.
Logging is what happens in East Texas.
The cover was probably done by some "Yankee".
We lived outside of Spurger, in the dry county.Oh yes, I guess I should not be surprised.
It shows what seems to be West Texas.
I know Fred, Texas.
But the jacket cover is all wrong!
If you blinked again, you would miss Spurger.
As a matter of fact my husband and I moved to Texas in 1982 to take care of his elderly relatives.

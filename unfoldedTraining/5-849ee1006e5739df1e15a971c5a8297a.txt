Not to long and not too short.
My kids were guessing at the words and not actually "reading" them.
I highly recommend this book.
I really think this would be great for any child.
The book has a great introduction to help the parent understand exactly what to do and the methods this book uses.
They are just right.
She used it on her son and now at age 5 he has a 3rd grade reading level.
I was impressed so I got it and am now on lesson 10 with my 4 year old.
I completely agree with it and am so glad I found out about this book.
Why spend hundreds of dollars on all the fancy reading programs when this works great for just a few dollars!
So my friend told me about this book.
If the lessons start out too easy you can always do two a day.
She enjoys the lessons.
By lesson 10 my daughter is already able to sound out and read two and three letter words.
I first used the Your Baby Can Read Program but soon realized it didn't teach phonics.

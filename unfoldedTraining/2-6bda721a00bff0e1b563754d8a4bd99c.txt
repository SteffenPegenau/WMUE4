Why?
Sure, it's better than his WCW work, but that's saying very little.2)The announcers are annoying.
They can't convey any emotion, and their idea of insight is to rattle off the names of some old school wrestlers.
And the women's stuff is a hundred times better than their American counterparts.
That may be so, but this tape doesn't prove it at all.
Ole Anderson wasn't the only or first wrestler to work on one body part, so why do they keep on bringing him up?
The work of Hayabusa is amazing.
Perhaps you've heard how they "invented" hardcore wrestling.
Perhaps you've heard about how great FMW is.
Let me count the ways.1)It has Horace freaking Hogan on it.
Dumb dumb dumb.There is some good stuff on this tape.
But really, if you can look around on the internet you can find much better tapes than this.
And their jokes are lame.3)The ultra-hardcore Death Match with Mr. Pogo is a lights out match.
Meaning you can't see what's going on.
In not one but two matches.

Songs like 'Detroit Rock City', 'Iron Man', 'Running with the Devil', 'Shout it Out Loud' are good examples of classic rock for the new generation of rockers.
The opening track from Everclear is a good high-powered starter.
And guess what?
A very 'un-Kiss' song.
I tried to shut my ears off to the lyrics and sing 'Don't Wanna Missa Thing' to the music of 'Nothing Can Keep Me From You'.
However, the greatest disappointment is Kiss's new 'Nothing Can Keep Me From You'.
A couple of good interpretations here.
Manson's version of AC/DC's 'Highway to Hell' is interesting.
Most of the parts fit in nicely!!
It is the original songs here that still rule the album.
Unfortunately, it lacks the rockability of the original.
And it sounds too much like Aerosmith's 'Don't Wanna Missa Thing' (both written by Warren).
!
It rocks...but, sadly, not hard enough!
From the track listing, this looks like a potential killer-rock album.

For those into something inteesting and fairly original, this is one of the beat albums you will find.
If you like only the b.m.
They blend thrash and b.m.
With Kronet..., they were a melodic, sad band.With the follow up to this, "Satanic Art", they are a keyboard laced, fast, futuristic b.m.
I bought this CD by DHG because I loved Kronet til Konge very much.
into a style that fans of both will love.
band.
that has keyboards loaded down on it, this is NOT for you.
But this is not as good as Kronet.. (read my review of that).
band.
A must buy.
It seems that DHG changes their style with evey release.
With this, they take the much followed path of thrash influenced b.m.This is not a bad thing, as they do it very well.
However, this is still great and essential.
The songs are very well written, with aldrahn and vicotnik's trademark vocals on each and every one.
With thir most recent, they are a techno b.m.

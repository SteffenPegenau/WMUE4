This is what my class was talking about?
*****************************PEACE EVERYWHERE*******************
So, if anybody actually enjoys this movie, don't talk to me.
There are a ton of movies that are funnier than this.
This is the funniest movie ever?
So what if his idiotic Mexican friend Pedro wants to be class president?
No way!
And... hello!
(now i understand why he wears the shirt that says "vote for pedro") This movie is about a nonsense idiot who has no goals in his life, has horrible friends, and lives with his grandparents.
Almost eveyone in my class says this movie is hilarious.
What the heck is the point of this?
My family rented this movie last night to watch.
I also rented Yours, Mine, and Ours, and it was much funnier and made more sense.
I hope this was helpful.
Hi.
So what, Napoleon lives with his grandparents and brother and has a llama?

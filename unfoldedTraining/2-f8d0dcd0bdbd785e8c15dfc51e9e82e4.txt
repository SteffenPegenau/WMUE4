i didn't buy this when it first came out so they could get rid of the bugs.
gone, and if they are there, they look better, more complete, in 2004.
SAVE your money and stick with 2004 ACOF.
Waaay better.
still major bridges AND major rivers that define state borders.
did both service packs.
2004 had an update to replace missings bridges.
did many tweaks per microsoft forums.
installed this on 2.6 dual core with 4g mem.256 mb video card.
X doesn't.
he doesn't want it either.
many major blds.
I gave this to my son to PLAY with.
so good luck flying vfr.
this turned out to be a disappointment.

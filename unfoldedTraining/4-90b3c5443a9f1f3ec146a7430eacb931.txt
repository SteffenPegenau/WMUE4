I like the bad boy alpha male hero type.
Cause its gonna blow you away.
She has no qualms about letting the reader know what was on her mind.This was a very interesting story, some parts were hard to believe, but I chose to ignore that in favor or enjoying a darn fine good book.
Having just discovered Anne Stuart I am sucking up her books like a vaccume.
And he kept most everything in, even from the reader, so you dont see him falling in love.
Very good book.
This is a very heart pounding book, pretty bloody as a warning.
This is # 2.
And I wanted a little more of an ending for these two, but I closed the book with a smile on my face.
My favorite and only type!
He is very hard, almost cold.
Bastien falls into that category.
We know Chloe is in love.
i recommend this highly.
I can go with the flow, whatever makes a good story.

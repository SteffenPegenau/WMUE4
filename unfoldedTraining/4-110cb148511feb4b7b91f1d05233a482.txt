Tightened, refilled with oil and it ran great after that.
It sat for two years in our basement with the new motor.
My husband bought a reconditioned unit on ebay.
Several choice words were used to express the frustration.
Very poor Quality Assurance program.
He found a pool of oil at the base of the unit.
Tore it apart, found a loose bolt.
Put two gallons of paint through it with no problems, no oil leaks, etc.
!
Used it for 20 minutes and it stopped spraying - no pressure.
Use the sprayer before the warranty runs out!
The motor would not run, only hum.
90 day warranty covered the motor replacement but he had to paint the room by hand.
Attempted to use it the first week of arrival.
Nice product once he got the bugs worked out.

I agree with Goldie comments.
Dee, Sarah, Chris, Dave, Ian, John, Kenui, Kevin and Pete; what a band!
Just view the DVD Of Simply Red, Home Live In Sicily.
EXCEPTIONAL
Love a band with the numerous instruments.
Most songs today, you can't understand what they are saying.
Flute, Saxophone, trombone, trumpet makes a great band.
GREAT MUSIC.
FABULOUSI highly recommend this DVD.
Pete can sure play those drums!
I love this music.
All band members are the best.
Well, its better late than never.
And Simply Red band is a group of the best and talented you will ever hear.
Mick Hucknall sings perfect.
At last, one can understand the words of a song.
And this band has it all.Don't forget the keyboards, percussion, guitar, bass guitar and let us not forget the drums.
Best concert I've seen in a long time.

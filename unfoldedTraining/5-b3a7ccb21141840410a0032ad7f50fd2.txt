the keyboardist plays like he has 8 fingers on each hand!!!
have you heard the drums on this album????
what????
the drums are on jazz-inflected blast-beat mode the whole time!!!
they dont care who likes it.
even though its not always all screaming, it's like 300 bpm with either screaming or high pitched yelling, with a moog keyboard that adds a new dimension to its double bass roll grind.
what makes it so great is why so many can't stand it: its SO extreme.
what?
theyre making real, visceral and incredible art.
no volunteers?
they are just around to totally f*** with everybody, indiscriminately.
this album is absolutely incredible.
nobody can deny that.
and to eversotragic: they aren't talented????
i dare any haters to try to play the guitar riffs and bass line.

His track is probably the hottest.
Mystikal comes in crazy as usual.
I think Master P. made a bad mistake by releasing them.
These guys are pretty good rappers, but Beats by the Pound made em sound corny.
These catz is hott.
I think this album is better than any new No Limit alubm out.
His lyrics were nice, so overall that track was blazin.
I like dis album overall, but still it doesn't get a 5 star cause it isn't that great.
The beats on this album are 10x better then what your accustomed to.
Kane and Abel put it down.
All I gotta say is that, I'm glad that these guys are out of No Limit.
Handle Ya Business was pretty good.
If your a fan of No Limit, get this album anyway.
If your a fan of Mystikal, nice beatz, and gangsts rap this is a "MUST GET".
I didn't know Mr-Serv On was that good.
The beat is tight, the production was tight.
A jump off from Rise to Power which is also hott.

After another few months the adjustable height coffee spigot wouldn't stay up any more.
We used this machine primarily for coffee.
The steam function quit after about six months.
Finally, the pump went and just dribbled a bit of coffee out.
I called about it in January and was told the service center was kind of busy.So, in the meanwhile, we got a Keurig.
Back for service.
Real waste of money.
It's flexible for both doses of coffee and amount of water.
That's where the positives end.The coffee was never very hot right out of the machine; had to use the microwave.
It came back on Feb. 19, '10.
The DeLonghi goes into the basement awaiting a future tag sale.
Back for service again.
It makes a great cup of coffee and the coffee is hot!
You can also use ground coffee.
It left here on Dec. 15, '09.

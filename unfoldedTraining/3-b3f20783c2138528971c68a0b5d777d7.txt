He was going to visit his father.
I think this book is boring.
He thinks, about how to survive without being scared.
His parents were divorced.
He catches the fish.
He feels like he is adult.
He every time was to talk with him self.
The main character is Brian Roberson.
I didn't like to read this book.
He is thirteen years old.
Now Brian is alone in the forest.
I like, stories where there are a lot of actions.I did like the main character Brian, because he is a strong person.
He builds the shelter.
He was there for 54 days.Hatchet is survival a book.
Brian tries to do everything to keep him alive.
There wasn't a lot of action.
The pilot of the plane died and the plane crashed.
In the book are a lot of hard words.
Brian makes a fire.
He always think before he does something.

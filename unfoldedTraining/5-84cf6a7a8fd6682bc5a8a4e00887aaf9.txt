This woman has done a metamorphosis and has become another kind of beautiful butterfly...she is in the best voice I've ever heard - strong, clear, dynamic.
Your low brow remarks say it all, so we won't suggest you find out first hand.
Rickie Lee Jones is transcendent.
The music is entrancing, the ideas unforgetable.
Back to Ms. Jones... Oh my god!
You repeat things you don't know?
You hear she can hardly stand onstage?
With all the familiar genius, grace, inspiration - and what a voice!
I thought I knew her - her style, her way.
A true artist and musician, she makes musicians want to write;to play!
No, you misunderstood... She knocks the audience off of their feet!
Here she is..entirely different; it's exciting!
What?
She inspires people to become musicians... That's important.
As for the obviously unstable, angry B_D@msn....Hey Buddy!

This is a good idea, but has design flaws.1.
If I could reduce my rating, I would.
The lids on a couple of the compartments will no longer stay closed.
I bought this because it had the dual am/pm design.
The compartments are white and opaque.
My previous one was a single and I had to use 2 and remember which was am and which was pm.
This is better in that way, but the others were a darker color so I could see light-colored pills better.
They were also transluscent, so I could see from the bottom.The removable covers are good for cleaning and filling, but the flaws outweigh the benefits.February 4, 2008 Update: Two of the 3 units I bought are now broken.
Many of my pills are white and tiny.
The lids do not stay closed.
This product is defective.
They come open much too easily.
They have not been dropped or damaged in any way.
I have a hard time seeing if I got the right pills in there.
I have had pills spill out.2.

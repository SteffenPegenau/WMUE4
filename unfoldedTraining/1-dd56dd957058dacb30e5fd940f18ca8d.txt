What did the author do?
This book is an insult to science fiction.
I used speed-reading to browse through about six more.
Then I gave up.
If a book burning were to be held this would be the kindling.
I got a Dempsey Dumpster.
I bought it because I read 'The Companions' by the same author and THAT was a great book.
I got incomprehensible, verbose, inane gibberish.
Toss a bunch of flowery words into the hopper, spin it up to max rpm and let it spew a hodgepodge out the chute?
Most likely.Don't waste your money - don't waste your time.
I was expecting something along the same lines but, instead, I got rubbish.
It's TERRIBLE.
The book got less and less interesting; more and more useless, stupid and trite.
I had to struggle to stay interested enough to read the first four chapters.
I got feminist lunacy.
This book is a great disappointment and a vast wasteland.

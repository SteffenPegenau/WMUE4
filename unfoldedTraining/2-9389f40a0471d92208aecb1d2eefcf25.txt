Lucky guy.
It's a pleasant enough listen and is well produced.
Mr. Blunt has that kind of raspy tenor that sounds sincere and inoffensive at the same time.
Kem, Norah Jones and a long list of others make this kind of candy.
The production is lush.
It sells because it fills a need.
It reads like bad high school poetry.
But is stuff like this memorable or profound?
No.
It's decent enough music to smooch to.
He's won the lottery with rather ordinary music.
Look at the lyrics of this CD.
I can point to tens of CDs made this year that are of this ilk that haven't been selling nearly as well.
It's the kind of stuff someone with very modest musical talent can thump away on a piano or guitar.Why the hype for this CD?
I have no idea.
Are the melodies particularly interesting?
Someone has to be anointed by the press, and this is James Blunt's turn.
It's elevator music, the kind of music some people put on to chill.

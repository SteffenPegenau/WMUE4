now i dont understand why people playing with hand?
when i play madden 2005, i get very mad because not real football.
i learn how to throw american football from watching little man on tv...like real life or no?
maybe people confuse about football!
make me angry cannot score more than 3 point kick play.
in napoli, football we play with foot, not throwing oval ball.
they stopping too much.
game too slow, one time in napoli we play but very fast running all the time, not here.
he show me how to do three point kick play?!?
but is ok
why wearing helmet??
but i try to play game anyway not sure of rules.
this is not real football!
i think nice pictures from game.
my friend know this type of football and he teach me how to play.
maybe more fun when i learn rules.

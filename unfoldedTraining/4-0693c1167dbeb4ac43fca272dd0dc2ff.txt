He met Penn in first grade.
He is very dorky.
I liked to read the book almost every day.
He thinks he is cool and is popular.
Penn is from North Dakota.
Something happens to Scooter and he ends up in the hospital.
He is a very good football player.
Crash is mean to Penn and when Mike moves in during sixth grade, he joins Crash and they pick on Penn together.
This is when Crash begins to change.
Scooter is his grandfather.
The main characters are Mike, Crash, Penn, and Scooter, but Crash is the most important character in the story.
Crash is very excited because he is staying for good and they spend a lot of time together.
Then Scooter moves in when Crash is in 7th grade.
They took his buttons away and they put mustard in his shoes.
You should read the book because it is interesting and funny!
You will never guess who become friends!I like how Jerry Spinelli wrote because he wrote how we talk.

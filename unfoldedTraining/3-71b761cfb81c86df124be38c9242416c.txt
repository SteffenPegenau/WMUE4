That song is the one song with a really Black Sabbath riff.
What's with all the cheesy keyboards?
I bought this CD solely because of the good reviews at this site.
I cite "Kill in the Spirit World" and "Call of the Wild" as blatant examples.
One note about that song: Halfway through, Iommi cuts into this Randy Rhoads thing, I'm not sure why.
The song "Headless Cross" has a way cool intro (can you say Van Halen?
Then there is "Nightwing" which is just stupid.
Otherwise, buy Dehumanizer.
They do not sound like what they are about.
), and then there is "When Death Calls".
And that's all I have to say.
I had not heard any tracks.
At least the CD had some high points.
If you like Sabbath that isn't Sabbath, get this CD.
It just doesn't make any sense.
Well, as soon as I listened to the CD, I got the feeling that Tony Iommi was trying to sound like Def Leppard.
What the Hell is a Nightwing?

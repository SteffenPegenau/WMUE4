Then i think of it though.
The sitcom music when the two dumb clumsy cops are introduced,the odd caption and missmatches with Wendy Chaplin.
thank you for taking the time to read this review.
The survivors of 4 (which i liked by the way) the got very weak in 5.
It (along with 6) is probably the wierdest movie ive ever seen in my life.
Dr. Loomis just finally i can see lost it.
Donald Pleasence is always great though.
Each time i see it i find a mistake.
The man in black really had me wondering.
I find it a fun movie to watch.
I would have to say like i tell everybody about this movie, it is not very good or original at all.
However it is interesting.
I have seen this movie a number of times.
Thats why I was disapointed with the acting.
I didnt like it when Ellie Cornwall was killed of.

The material is superb.

Champian is one of the best female Jazz Voacalists/Pianists around today.
Great Jazz vocalist and a GREAT Big Band backing her up.
If this is the style of Jazz that you like, then this is as GOOD as it GETS !

I am lucky enough to see her regularly here in NYC, usually with her trio, which is a MUST SEE.
Listen to the samples here.
This CD is Champan Fulton with David Burger and the Sultans of Swing Big Band.
They regularly play on Tuesday nights at Birdland here in NYC.
This CD has it all.
One of the best Big Bands around today.

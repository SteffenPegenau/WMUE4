Laura is dead.
Is she alive?
The style was different and the ending was not what I was used to.I have also noticed that this last series has covers of bright colors and borders where the older books have dark plain covers.
Then they started showing up again in the more recent books.
While later the pages stopped showing.
Im a little confused.
Andrews books.
Either you have let too much information leak in your description or you meant Melody Logan.
Okay fine.
In several of the earlier books there was a small page that said that V.C.
Is this a change for the purposes of asvertising or is it because of a new writer?
Either way I will be waiting for the arrival of the new book.
Well... anyway I am enjoying this series although it doesn't seem like any of the other V.C.
Andrews had passed away.
I also read the description of Music in the Night.

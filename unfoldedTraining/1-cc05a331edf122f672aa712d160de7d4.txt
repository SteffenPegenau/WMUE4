I can tolarate little plot but not no plot.
How doesn't say, why doesn't say, what is going on doesn't say.

Well the Ring plays on some peoples fear of the format.
So many questions that have no answers.
They say horror movies are the easiest kind of movie to make and The Ring is the biggest example of this.
The Ring has no thought or talent.
How she made the tape?
Is it the poor quality sound and picture, the rewinding, the lack of extras, or the bad think annoying size.
It needs some kind of story.
It involes a tape that kills you seven days after you watch it.
how her spirit got so powerful?
Sorry moddy setting, and scary music do not equal a good horror movie.
The little girl soal appear to kill through the TV.
What is it about VHS that makes it so scary.
Please skip this and remember.

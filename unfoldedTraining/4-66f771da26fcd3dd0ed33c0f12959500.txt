Battery is still very good, at least 2 1/2 hrs to 3 hrs.
Plays everything I threw at it, dvd+rw, dvd-r, dvd+r, cd/r/rw, mp3, audio cd, vcd, svcd, etc.
Plays mpeg2 files.
Battery is good for about 3 1/2 hours.Image is definitely nicer than Mintek's and comparable to other more expensive brand names.
Overall, a great player, as long as it doesn't die on me after three month warranty.Update - 2 yrs laterBought this Christmas of 2004.
Kids sometimes play videogames with av input.
Had it for one week.
Also lost remote so can't fast forward/reverse or choose audio mode.
Wish I could edit the star rating to 5.
Developed two bad pixels.
Still works great!
Only thing it didn't play was svcds created with Nero.
on't know why.
Dropped it at least ten times in the car and twice in the kitchen.
Can only advance by chapters.

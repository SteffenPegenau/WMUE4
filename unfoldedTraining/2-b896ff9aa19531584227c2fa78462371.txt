In living color was known breaking Hip Hop into the mainstream.
This is In living color with no soul.
I asked myself the fly girls seem lame.
Where are all the music Videos Shabba ranks Mr Ugly man,, vanillia ice.
in many ways watching this show makes me relive my past.
Why are they palying with us.
Please.
i dont care if i have to buy another set just give me those Videos and lost skits.
But those great songs are gone.
But i can remeber so much more.
Only thing ive seen is Mc hammer.
So much more.
The music has been changed into Techno rap that seems just strange.
Is there a reason, is my memoery playing games with me.
its not the fly girls its the music thier dancing to.
In living color was my childhood.
NO.
Im pissed off.
This is not in living color.

Explicit for those under the pre-teen age.
So, all in all, a 3 out of ten, and a disapointment.
I was not attracted by the plot, but I am a fan of kelly Clarkson so I was excited to see it.
The dancingwas explicit for anyone under 12.
This movie, if rated for that, would be R!
is the bottom line.
Are all understatements, so beware...partly entertaining, but don't take the younger ones!
However, although all the singing got to be stupid, the music was pretty good.
WARNING!
Booty-shakin?
The movie "Blue Crush" was rated PG-13 for 'teen party-ing.'
The plot is not original.
I just saw this movie and was disapointed.
Bikini-wearin?
Whipped cream bikinis?

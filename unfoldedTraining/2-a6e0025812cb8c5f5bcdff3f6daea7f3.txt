I have seen Omar in concert twice and consider myself a huge fan.
The first song is hip-hop jazz.
Cool, but not what I was expecting from Omar Sosa at all.
Some I just hate.
WRONG.
As for myself, I wish I had listened a lot more carefully before I bought.
The first concert I saw with Omar and John Santos was pure magic.
Wow!
I thought I knew all about Omar Sosa and knew what I was buying.
You may like it.
This is a bad surprise.
My advice; listen carefully to the music samples and see what you think.
This CD is NOTHING like what I heard in concert.
That's life in the food chain...
Some of the tracks are good.

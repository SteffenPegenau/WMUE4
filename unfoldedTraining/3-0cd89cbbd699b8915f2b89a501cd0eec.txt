"The Oh in Ohio" had a lot of the ingredients to make it a successful film but it didn't quite do it for me.
Priscilla's narrative felt confident.
However, I found the film to be oddly hollow.
He is always likable.
I enjoy Paul Rudd's performance.
That said, it is still an enjoyable film.
I commend the film for pairing an unlikely couple together, even though it is not within the norms of Hollywood.
While I appreciated the trajectory and character arc of Priscilla and Jack, I also found it difficult to pinpoint the point of the story.
It left us a void that the movie should have filled.
I wasn't sure how his narrative fit into the grand scheme of the movie.
However, Paul Rudd's storyline seems muddied.
The ending seemed abrupt and unconvincing.
I enjoy the premise of the film as it centers on the Priscilla's sexual awakening.
Paul Rudd and Parker Posey are great enough actors to keep us captivated, even if the story doesn't do them justice.
It knew where it wanted to go.

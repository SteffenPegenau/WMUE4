All right .. That's it ....
The battery take about 4 hours to get charged .
Toshiba take 1 1/2 .
And I can tell you that toshiba runs faster .
The question is .... Sony weight 3,7 toshiba weight 5,0 .
I used to have a Toshiba Core Duo T5500 with 2 giga RAM , and 256 video card SHARED .
Sony also doesen't have a separate buttom to control volume .
I always had toshiba , a toshiba with the same configuration will cost USD 1200,00 .
Sony even with hibrid memory video and best processor ( 2,00 X 1,66-TOSHIBA ) , run a little bit slower .
But doens't compense pay more for it .
You have to do it on the keyboard .
It is a lightweight computer , the design is really good .But do not waste USD 2149,00 as I paid for .
Toshiba come with a DVD recovery .
The A/C Charger is also bigger than toshiba .
Of course it weights a little bit more .
If you don't need lightweight buy toshiba .
Sony not !

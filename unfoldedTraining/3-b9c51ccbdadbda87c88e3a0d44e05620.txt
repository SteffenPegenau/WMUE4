Brightman?
Sounded like a winner in the ad.
In fact, that song is positively dreadful, and it's all because of Costello's vocally-strained style.
All Three Tenors?
Florez?
What the hell is he doing on this CD?
All on one CD?
Bocelli?
), that Anne Sofie Von Otter's performance is actually a duet with Elvis Costello, who simply does not have the chops or vocal gifts that most of the other artists on this CD are blessed with.
Nor do they mention (even Amazon doesn't show it!
They don't mention the Main Title from Star Wars.
Pavarotti?
The rest of this CD is generally fine, but certainly do not expect a CD full of classical music, and be prepared to skip song #2 every time you play the CD.
Watson?
I wonder how many people saw the ad for this CD on TV and ordered it right away without looking further into the contents.

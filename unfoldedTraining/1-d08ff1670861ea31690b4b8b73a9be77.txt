I used it 2.5 times.
The book says the machine will shut itself down if it gets too hot.
After vacuuming about 125 sq ft, it slowed and groaned again.
I gave it a 1-week break and tried again.
The vacuum works ok now.
Most of the rug just lies there unused.
The machine broke down after very little use.
Two weeks later, I got it back and gave the carpet some long overdue attention.
I checked the warranty, and I was covered, so I took it to the shop.
I checked the refund policy and I'd had it too long for that.
I live by myself in a 1-br apartment, and I'm pretty clean.
Then it stopped running at a nice vigorous whir and groaned slowly.
I turned it off and read the owner's manual.
It has seen only very light service.
I detest doing housework, but I vacuum the rug once a month (or maybe once in 6 weeks) whether it needs it or not.
The cure is to give it a 1/2 hour break.

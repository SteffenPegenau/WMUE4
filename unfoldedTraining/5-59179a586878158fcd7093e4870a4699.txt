The story is grand.
Tim Burton brings to life, a dream he had as a child.
His imagination is incredible.
I live out in the boonies.
The houses are all Pink, Yellow, or Blue.
SO WHAT!
Some scenes I was laughing,(like when he made the sheepdog look like a poodle).
Hey, isn't that what society is like today, all those nosy neighbors.
Johnny Depp rocks as Edward.
But, the main thing I have to say is that Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Winona Ryder deliver a great story.
What would I know though?
The acting is great.
The setting is crazy though.
This movie is excellent in every way.
No wonder Tim Burton chose him for Sleepy Hollow.
Winona Ryder was great as the daughter who learns a profound lesson in life.

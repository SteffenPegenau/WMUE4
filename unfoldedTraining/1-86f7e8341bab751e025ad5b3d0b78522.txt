I had to get all Hollywood and buy this [stuff].
NOPE!
I paid the ... listing price.
Can't finish my masterpiece!
Grab a sheet of paper, and tally all reviews with 3 or more stars compared to 2 or less.
They know how to use multimedia for guys like me.
Read these reviews, read them all.
Creative sound manipulation, transitions, clip editing, but if you can't get the final product, what good is it.
Spent hours upon hours, tried the customer support, believe me I tried.
It came with a decent editing program.
I just want to make movies that will entertain my family and friends...
Period.
I like making movies.
I want to make this work...This program is great as far as the features go.
Rendering kills me!
...!You are now looking at an iMac convert.
I bought a Digital Camcorder for that purpose.
See what I mean.
My PC is pretty decent, 2 ghz processor, 30 gig HD, 512 MB RAM, according to the system requirements listed for this product, I'm ahead of the curve.

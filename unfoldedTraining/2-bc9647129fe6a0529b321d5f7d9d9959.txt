Big type to take up space.
You can find a better book on Galaxies for grownups.
Its a kids book.
No real substance to use as a reference book.
Book is good for young children or parents showing and reading to young children,
Will give book to my nephew as birthday present.
Very basic descriptions.
I have seen quality galaxy pictures and these were not it.
Took a gamble there would be some reference information I could use as an amateur astronomer...NOT.
Do not like the book.
Poor quality pictures.
Good for a 7 or 8 year old only.
Very disappointed.
That way his mom can show him the pictures and read the basic descriptions.At least someone will get enjoyment from it.
Even if your a new amateur astronomer you will want more meat and potatoes about Galaxies than this book offers.Save your money on this one.
I already knew 95% what author wrote.

This has worked very well.
It is fairly compact and not too heavy - so it is easy to move around.
I mounted my saw on a sheet of plywood with a 2 x 4 cleat under it, allowing it to be mounted on a WorkMate.
and stored on a shelf when not in use.
No power tool has saved me more time than this one.
Overall very satisfied.
This sucks up most of the dust.
I glued a 2 1/2" to 1 1/4" adapter into the dust port to use the saw with my shop vacuum.
It has also been used for many woodworking projects.
No further adjustments needed.
The vertical clamp from the miter gauge for the DW746 with sliding table fits this saw.
No complaints.
The dust collection bag is not worth much.
An easy adjustment.
It was off by a fraction of a degree out of the box.
The saw has done everything I asked of it.
Since that simple adjustment was made 5 years ago, the saw has remained accurate.
5 years ago for doing all the trim in my house.
I bought this saw approx.

For video, its much less.
You can also just drag music/video/pictures onto the system.
I wouldn't reccommend this simply for its battery life.
This jukebox isn't too bad.
It works as a harddrive, in fact, the storage on this device is actually a labtop hard drive.
RCA def.
The screen is pretty nice.
You cannot navigate through the menu while listening to music, which is highly annoying.When recording video, the audio and video is not always synchronized.
I would say it lasts about 90 minutes of continuous play for music.
However, if you turn it on or off, it cuts down the battery time by about half.
needs to fix this.Overall, i would not reccommend this device, not until RCA releases new firmware.
Its horrible.The menu is also slow, and can be hard to navigate.
Pictures and video come out pretty clear, although it only plays mpeg video files.It records from the tv also.
This is a really neat feature.What i hate about this item is the battery.
It uses music match, which isn't too bad.

Alien is a movie this is compared to.
There is no comparison.
Second, I love sci fi, especially scary sci fi.
So I went to see it in 3d.Let's start with the 3d.
I rate the 3d in Prometheus as fair.The movie itself started out to make me think this was going to be really good.
I generally like 3d as well.
Maybe it's because there was too much reminiscent of Alien.
Alien held my interest from beginning to end.
Instead, as the movie dragged on, I found it boring most of the time.
I think animated movies look the best in 3d.
I was looking forward to seeing this movie.
This movie did not.
First, Ridley Scott is top notch as a director.
For me, this wasn't very original.For all the 5 star raters, I think you are very generous.
Avitar is the exception which I thought was great.
Live action movies are rated by me as good, to poor.

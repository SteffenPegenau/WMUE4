I'd keep it at a good distance.
I keep wireless turned off most of the time because new research is showing that wireless can damage your DNA.
Lot's of can't find page or scrambled pages in IE.
I use it mostly for ethernet.
This router is fast.
I get about 80mb of my 100mb service though it.
When I switched to Google Chrome the problem went away, and I like Chrome so it is not really a big problem.
My old Netgear only gave me about 10mb.
It works fine for accessing the Web though, It is just setup that is a problem.
My old Netgear (g) only gave me 1mb.
It is not fully Mac compatible in that respect.
I get about 40mb in wireless mode.
So be careful if you have a Mac and are not prepared to use Chrome.
I had difficulty in accessing the set-up menus on my Mac using FireFox, IE, and Safari.
I also did fine from a Windows PC running FireFox and IE.

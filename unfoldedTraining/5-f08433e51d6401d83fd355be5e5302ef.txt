he has the vocal range of MJK from Tool.
the lead singer voice is amazing.
i love all the tracks on the CD but the standout track for me has to "i Believe".
i was in my CD store thinking of something to buy and in the store they have those scanners where u get to preview the cd before u buy it.
probably since Disturbed's 'sickness' debut.
Ra - From One...its actually a funny story how i came across this CD.
and the drumming is supreb.
i bought the cd and listened to it on the way home.
the guitar and bass riffs range from korn to tool.
i picked the Ra cd because i thought the cover art was kool and the name of the band was peculiar.
all the track are great.
this has to be one of the best debuts to come out in a while.
when i scanned it....i was blown away by the opening track, "Do You Call My Name".
TRUST ME.
if u like bands like Tool, Korn, Chevelle, Dream Theater and Trust Co. ull love this CD.

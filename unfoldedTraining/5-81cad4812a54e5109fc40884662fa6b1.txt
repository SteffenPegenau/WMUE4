Read your bible it is VERY clear that we have a responsibility.
It keeps things simple and focused on GOD!
Are we working towards sanctification (being set apart to do His plan)?
Do we have the Lordship mastered?
Henry comes from the persective that God loves us perfectly.
How effective are we (in our lives as a whole) if sickness is lording over us instead of God?
This book reminds us that it is NOT in our strength or works but God's strength working through us.
God's plan is to work good not evil!
He forgives us perfectly and wants to heal us perfectly.
Henry shows that we have a part in this.
I know that I don't and Pastor Henry says that he doesn't either, but isn't that what God wants?
Why?
It is not exhaustive of itself but definitely points out that God wants US whole.
My prayer is that you READ this book along with your bible prayerfully and let God reveal His truth and set you free!
This book in conjunction with God's word has changed my life like never before!

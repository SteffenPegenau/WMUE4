I just sit there.
Worse than before.
Well it sure didn't help me.
But still, no one listens to me.
I am so sad and lonely.
Lost.
I bought this book.
Patting men on the back.
Sad.
The book made me feel even more isolated.
But I'm no good at it.
I tried doing what the book said.
Smiling.
This book is premised on the suggestion that it will help you.
Gladhanding.
Maybe this book will help you, but it didn't help me.
Shouting.
I read it.

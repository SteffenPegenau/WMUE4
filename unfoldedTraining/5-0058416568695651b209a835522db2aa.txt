I am now understanding the role of a man and a woman in a marriage and now I know what to look for when I do get married again.
I went through it.
Women and men are the same in the spirit, but they provide a different function.
I haven't finished reading all the chapters yet, but I can't put it down.
If one person doesn't fulfill their role, the marriage will not work.
!
Decide for yourself, it is a real blessing to me.
I wish I would've read this book before I got married.
Thanks Bishop Long!!
I am reading this book now.
Unfortunately, I am divorcing, but I can say that this book is a real pick-me-up.
Work as a team under the guidance of the Almighty.
God wants relationships to have order.
The responsibility of a man in the household, How men and women are different, how to get past hurts and how not to be manipulitive.
The love emotions will fade and it will end in disaster!
Amen!

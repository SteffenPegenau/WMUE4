wow!
read "winning the marketing war" instead.
michaelson also features sun tzu quotes that have been interpreted by other writers and strategists.
however, i've found it very dry.
so, i bought it with great anticipation.
what keen insight!
then, underneath it, he'll feature two or three others interpreting sun tzu saying, "if you look at the sky it is blue."
might quote sun tzu as saying "the sky is blue."
michaelson quotes sun tzu and gives quick summaries and examples from the corporate world.
i was very disappointed with this book -- it's dry.
"winning the marketing war" offers real world advice applicable to any business.
"the art of war for managers" does not.
I found myself falling asleep whenever i opened it up.
for instance g.m.
my copy has been highlighted again and again and again.
i was thrilled to see a new gerald michaelson bok on the shelf.
these interpretations are frequently word for word -- or darn close.

You want Lucas to get back at Dan and say the perfect thing.
I love One Tree Hill.
The entire first and second season was prefect.
Its still a good show i just want that feeling back.
You were hanging on to his every word when he spoke to him.

Everything they go threw you go through with them because youve been there before in you life.

Dont get me wrong.
You can relate to everyone of the characters on some level.
How could he not love his own son.
I wanted more and it just never seem to come for me.
In first season you could feel the magic.
The magic.
You hurt for him.

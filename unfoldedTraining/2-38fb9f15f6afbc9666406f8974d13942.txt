Now .
Previous Carrey movies such as Liar,Liar proved that Jim could still make hilarious films.
.
Morgan Freeman works for me as God, but I cannot see Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston together .
.EVER.
.
Sure there are a couple (literally) of moments that made me chuckle, but none that made me really laugh hard.
I dunno, maybe its just me, but I just expect more from the comical genius that is Mr. Jim Carrey.
.
.
Yet I sit here and wonder.
...
It's a good concept for a Jim Carrey movie, but it never follows through.
where's my "Dumb and Dumber 2"?
.
why is this movie so bad???
He's one of the most naturally funny guys I've ever seen.
I've been a big Jim Carrey fan for a while.
I mean, come on, he's starred in one of the funniest movies of all time, Dumb and Dumber.

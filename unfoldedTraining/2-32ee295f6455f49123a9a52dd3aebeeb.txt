I tried really hard to love it, but its just....boring!
Its great Angry girl, Emotional girl music.
Well, not me.
I really can't put my finger on it.
I love KCs CD.
I even like Britney's album better and I can't stand her.
This CD just doesn't make me feel anything even though she sings about some of the same themes.
I actually even removed it from my MP3 player because I kept skipping over it anyway.
Maybe its too safe-sounding.
Someone here said this is what we wish Kelly's CD was.
I'm sorry to bring down the average, but I had to tell the truth.
:-)
I love Kim Locke, but I am dissapointed with the CD.
She has a great voice; my favorite voice to come out of AI after Kelly C and Carrie.
I don't know.

I have a two disc live set they played in Hamburg I got from Napster.
That's what they do live.
Like they were trying to cram in as many different tracks as possible before the 75 min.
There are some sparkling moments here but I felt overall the editing on the CD was a little strange.
This should have been a double CD.
This Cd serves well as another document to repetroire of live Underworld and is therefore very worthy of your collection.
Depsite the shortcomings, this CD will snuggle into my 300 player right next to the Hamburg recordings.
I've never seen UW live so I am grateful to the techno-gods for granting my wish on DVD.
Yeah they reworked tunes on that play also.
time limit was up.
It takes away from the intensity of the music.
To me that is the real live CD.
Underworld is incredible.
Should have been a 2CD!
However, I'm expecting the DVD will be twice as long and a beautiful production.

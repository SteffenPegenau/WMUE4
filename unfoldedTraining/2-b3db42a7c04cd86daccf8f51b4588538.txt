I am not very tall, nor do I have exceptionally long legs.
I've had other people try it of various hieghts and they all agree.
Maybe because I wasn't walking the way I usually do.
The design of this thing is lousey.
However, BEFORE you buy it WALK AROUND THE STORE SEVERAL TIMES.
I was very unhappy.
It seemed fine in the store.
I will not use it again.
I now have a [$$$] clothes tree.
You will, (unless you have a really short step) hit your shins on the bottom of this stroller.
It's nice that it folds all the way down for a newborn.
But after I riped all the tags off and brought it to the boardwalk I realized how uncomfortable it is to walk with.
The material is snazzy too.
SO TRY IT FIRST or you'll be stuck with it like I am.
That is why I bought it.
I like the all weather muff and the way you can switch the bar to go from front to back.

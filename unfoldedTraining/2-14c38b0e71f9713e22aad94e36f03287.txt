The same error popped up when I restarted my PC.
I did a little research and found the anti-pirate software will no longer run my legitimate copy of this game that I bought used from Amazon.
Once again, I uninstalled/reinstalled, hoping that the retail version 1.0 will work.
No such luck.
All this hassle and the game will no longer run.
The game crashed as it loaded my saved game.
What a load of _____.
So I uninstalled the game, reinstalled it, and downloaded another copy of the 1.08 patch.
I made it about halfway through and the next time I went to fire up F.E.A.R., there was an error that said the game cannot play.
I will admit, it was fun when the game actually works.
Way to punish the gamer.
My brother gave me rave reviews of this game.
The problem is, the manufacturers of F.E.A.R.
installed anti-emulator software with the game.
What gives?

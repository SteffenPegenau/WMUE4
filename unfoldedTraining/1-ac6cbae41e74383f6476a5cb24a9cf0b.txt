well when i got these, i wasn't impressed with the flashy packaging or the cute little pictures on the box.
Another thing, the sound quality wasn't even that great.
This product is an epic failure.
a $5 pair lasts longer than that.
Also, the color "midnight blue" is a lie.
I opened them up, tried them out, etc, etc.
not the intimidating and sexy dark blue depicted on this website.
they worked fine so i used them for about 2 months, until one day the right one just decided to stop working.
they had SOME bass but thats about the only outstanding attribute.
Don't even waste your time thinking about buying them.
don't waste your time with this slack off french brand, get something that'll last longer.
Yes, they are blue, but its a light-teal-metallic-gayish blue.
so you're telling me that i payed $25 for 2 months of music?
these are absolute junk.
for comfort, they felt like every other pair of silicon buds.

if you are an extreme Christian, you will probably find this book offensive.
Oh!
nothing is really glorified.
every character is a living breathing person with real emotions.
as a girl not sure what she was, this book helped me find my answers.
it really did change my life.
a beautiful journey into your soul that you'll never forget.
it doesn't by anymeans glorify the old religion.
and it really is the kind of book you can read again and again.
some books you can only read once.
it transports you to a time when life wasn't meant to be lived in a hurry.
but that is one of the beautiful things about it!
it isn't fast paced, it's true.
I'v read it so many times.
it's so beautifully written!
I myself am of the 'old religion' (pagan/celtic) but I didn't really know that until I read this book.

I loved ADVENTURE and have played it dozens of times so far.
This was about the first RPG game, and it took me back so many years.
What a disappointment).
(Skip the INTELLIVISION ten game pack for the pc.
!
Many of the progressive games have children's levels, which is about all that I can handle.
My only complaint are that the instructions don't seem to be printable, but the games are not that difficult.
Quarter snatchers indeed!!!
If you want to see video game history or want to go back to your youth, buy this fabulous collection.
This is my first review.
Interviews with the founder of Atari are very interesting.
All of the games work perfectly.
Missile Command is fun when you can do more than two screens!
The extras are wonderful also.
At 25 cents per game, this is the best bargain in history.
The later games like Super Breakout have prettier colors, and are a blast.
I can't make much progress on the arcade versions, but they are beautifully rendered.

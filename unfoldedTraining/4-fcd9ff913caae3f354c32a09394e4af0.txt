Some very good characters here, both good and bad to enjoy.
A far better movie than I was expecting.
Just picked this up and at the risk of sounding too technical... "WOW"!
PQ is excellent.
Don't have to be a baseball fan to appreciate that one either.
SQ is very dynamic and a real treat to experience.
You do not by any means have to be a car buff to enjoy this movie.
Our hero is getting pressure from all sides and up and down as well.
Solid blacks, colors and nice detail.
Cage's character has to "acquire" 50 of the hottest cars all in one night to save his younger brother's life as repayment for his brother's colossal screw up in a car boost.
Wish I had picked this BD up earlier!
Highly Recommended!
Practically non-stop excitement.
A nice script and tight directing.
Kind of like Field of dreams.
A real Gem with very good rewatchability.
Granted, the cars are amazing etc, etc, but lets review the movie.

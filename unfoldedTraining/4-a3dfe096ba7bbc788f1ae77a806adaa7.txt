I even gave it four stars, which means that I found it to be a really good book or I had ulterior motives.
Chemical reactions... during this time.
Think about how complicated it is to brew beer.
Yeast?
At first I was very dubious about this claim, but in light of how little people knew in 1600's, 1700's and 1800's the claim becomes quite plausible.
Steam engines appear eventually.
They didn't even really know what yeast was.
What I really enjoyed about this book though is how it correlates with science.
Beer is a healthy drink and water is poisonous.
This feature of the book makes up for the sections of the book where the author, G-Dog, just claims beer was a part of this important event because ... it was there.
Machines?
Pre-Lister era.
Medicine?
I really enjoyed this book and I have a good reason why.
It's really awesome seeing how this develops.
First off, it is non-fiction which almost garners a star just for being readable.

I didn't even have very high expectations.
It lacked character development and I don't feel I got to know all the sisters.
It is a quick read however.
The book was very disappointing.
The characters were annoying, I didn't like how colonel fitzwilliam was portrayed at all.
Wow.
.
The daughters of Darcy and Elizabeth were not very engaging.
.I was pretty harsh.
You cannot possible match up to Jane Austen.
I would have thought he would be more agreeable.
After reading this I thought that people should leave well enough alone.
I guess you should read it as a romance novel but not as a sequel to Jane Austen.
it read like a regency romance novel.
There was not natural wit to the writing.

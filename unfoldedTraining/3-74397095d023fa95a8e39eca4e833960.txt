My husband was nervous it would all fly off the roof, but that did not happen.So .
Since we only had pillows, blankets, clothing and sleeping bags in there, my husband loaded it on he ground and threw it onto the roof.There is no zipper for closing.
it works, but is very awkward to load.
I'd feel better if they added a zipper to it.Went on the trip and everything held together.
The minute I opened this PackRight, I knew I would not be fond of it.
Why?
We tried it that way but gave up.
.
With the opening facing backwards, it's very awkward to load.
.
Roll it up like a potato chip bag and secure with a buckle.
Because it opens towards the rear of the car.
Unless your supplies are light, that's the only way to do it.
I knew that, but thought there would be a zipper or something that goes along the side to help with packing.
Instructions say to load the carrier while it's on the roof.

I had to start out with a Miata, I hate those cars.
You have traction control, which is good if you like that kind of thing (I don't), great graphics blah blah blah...Oh, and thankfully the license tests are easier and the naviagation is alot easier when you're buying a car from the second one.Ok the bad, NO USED CARS!
It's easier to tune your car!
Ok, first it's great, there are alot of improvements from the last 2 games.
Which is a real pooper.
And by the way, I'd rather race one of those than some stupid exotic sports cars, those things are just average to me.
!
But if you can't wait you'll like it anyway.
Oh well.
I loved it.
Second, you guys remember the really cool hot rides and classics like the 69' Covette Stingray, the Charger, and the other...cars?
And if you aren't used to traction control turn it off!!
Buy it used don't pay full price.
YOU DON'T GET THEM!
I WANT MY STINGRAY!!!

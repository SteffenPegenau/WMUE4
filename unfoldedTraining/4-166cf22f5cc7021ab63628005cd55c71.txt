I am such a huge fan.
This film is amazing.
I love the choices she makes.
I feel that she is one of the best actresses in movies today.
He made me believe.
Shame on me!
What a marvelous choice by the director.
Nicole Kidman was hypnotic as Anna.
It's one of those films that I've had on my list to watch but just had not gotten around to it for one reason or the other.
If you love movies you owe it to yourself to see this.
I was hooked from beginning to end.
The whole movie was so beautifully atmospheric.
What a shot!
This film was mesmerizing.
The gorgeous score was haunting.
There is a shot of Anna at the opera, no dialogue just music, that locks on her face as she makes you believe in her reality.
I love how emotions play across her translucent face.
Cameron Bright as Sean is also great.
I just cannot say enough good things about this movie.

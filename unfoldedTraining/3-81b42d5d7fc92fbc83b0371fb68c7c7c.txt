:( Its Hard To Get A Job And Make Friends.
I Recomend Animal Crossing And Harvest Moon Over This By Far.
This Is The Only Sims Game I Have And I Dont Think I'll Buy The Others Now.
And If You Dont Hire A Maid And Gardner You Whole House And Yard Goes To Pot!
Its Impossible To Keep Your Poor Person Happy And In Good Health.
I Just Dont Like It That Much Overall.
Designing Your House And All.
But Your Person Gets Tired And Hungry To Fast And The Days Goes By Far To Fast.
There Is No Way To Keep Up With Everything.
I've Always Heard Good Things About The Sims But I Just Dont Get It.
And Your Poor Dogs And Cats End Up Running Away Because They Were Sad And Negleted.
It Is Such A VERY Busy And Dare I Say, VERY Stressful Game.
It Is Fun I Guess.
Games Should Be Hard In a Good Way, This One Is Just Plain Difficult.
Its A Challenge For Sure.

very nice, actually.
what do i know.
It's also no way definitely not a workout.
I got Sexy Moves for the Club dvd, and to me, That one is an exotic dance workout.
Not bad.
she is mostly walking around sexy, and then stretching around on a chair or on the floor like a kitty cat and then rubbing her legs in the air.
so okay.
a nice little walk around and stretching routine.
It's definitely very sexy.
Dance?
It's okay.
This one is nice, too, but it's too slow and easy to be much more than a stretching routine.
However, to me that's not really dancing.
I recommend it.
much better.
I think the title is misleading.

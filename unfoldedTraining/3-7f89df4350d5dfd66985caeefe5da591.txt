We have this guy who goes back home because his brother is missing.
Later, the guy gets bitten and turns into a wolf.
HOLLA!
!I was not expecting that much from this film.
I hadn't heard that much about it.
However, none of the characters seen really invested in the story.
Then, we find out that his father is also a wolf and that he had murdered his son.
Definately do not buy this one.
Now, I see why.
It all sounds interesting enough.
If you took out the scene where the 2 wolves are fighting this would not even be worth renting.
The character development is pretty limited.
So,lets not dwell on that.
This movie is not a complete bore but it never really gets exciting either.
(SPOILER)!!
Just rent it.
His brother is then found dead.
We all no that this story has been told before.
It's not even worth it on blu-ray.

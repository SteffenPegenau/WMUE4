Out of my Head- This song is sounds like Nirvana to much!
Sounds like a more optimistic Alice in Chains Song!
10/104.odigal Dad- Good song but the lyrics are pretty sad.
Hey for all you people who haven't heard this CD, you need to.
6/107.Electric- Good strong heavy song!
This album could be the best Contemporaray Christian.
9/10
Besisdes this They are awesome....P>1.
But anyway these lyrics are very heart felt, and there singer has a good voice but maybe tooo reminincent of Bush and Guns n' Roses but they are still good.
Use Me- maybe the heaveist song on this album and an awesome solo!
10/102.
5/103.Alive- The best song on hear!
7/105.Kaleidoscope eyes- Third best song on this album!
10/106.Proverb Doll- Good song but easily skipped.
I myself am a Christian, but don't care to much for Christaina Music, I lke this album some Audio A and All P.O.D.

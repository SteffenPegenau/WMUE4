(Timmy's best friend), etc...
My kids loved it and watches it all the time.
They love Fairly Odd Parents we watch it every day.
I expected to see Vicki (the babysitter), A.J.
Myself would watch with them but if I had to get up and fold laundry or cook dinner that it wouldn't break my heart to miss the movie.
The fairies was great you couldn't have asked for better actors to play Wanda & Cosmo.
My kids & I couldn't wait for it to get here so we could watch.
I remember watching Timmy Turner when I was growing up and loved the show.
When it did we watched it immediatley.
It focused more on Timmy falling in love with Trixy (vicki's little sister).
So when I came across this I just knew I had to have it.
Me, well I was disappointed.
I guess I expected better.
My kids loved it & wacthed it 3 or 4 more times that day.
So I introduced it to my kids.

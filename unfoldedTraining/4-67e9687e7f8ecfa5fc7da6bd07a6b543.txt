Easy tuning to transmitter.
Easy to place on charging stand.
after transition from loud to soft passages.
Pretty good line-of-sight range.
Some static when you move around.
Light weight.
Transmitter power control.
900 MHz phones and NEXTEL cell phones interfere with signal.
Slight whooshing noise (compander?)
Reasonably priced.
Around-the-ear foam cups block most external sounds from user (and headphone sounds from others).Cons: Non-adjustable headband (auto-adjust strap mostly works).
Bass is somewhat boomy and treble is flat, but adequate for TV, most music--needs to be equalized for classical, piano.
Pros: Good overall sound quality and volume.
Surprisingly comfortable for long periods.
Works poorly when moving behind walls, but OK when still.
Picks up older (CRT) TV whine if transmitter is close to TV.
Use AAA-format batteries (comes with rechargable li-ion).
On-off switch on headphones.

Great Sound!
I never write reviews but this is the best CD I've bought in a very long time.I recommend the AMERICANA CD to EVERYBODY!
I can't get enough of all of them.
Can't wait till the next one.AMERICANA RULES!
Just take your pick.
A new CD would be coming and I just got it!
I'm the biggest Jimmy Buffett fan on the planet.
Which songs do I like?
WOW!
!GRRRRRREAT JOB KEY WEST!
I've been watching Key West in Austin Texas for the last five years.
Great Musicians!
We wanted to buy a CD but they told us to wait.
Great Party!
I saw these guys at Johnny Fins on Lake Travis near Austin in the Summer of 2002.
I give 10 Stars!
This roster of Key West'rs rivals the Coral Reefer band which I love dearly.

Buy the incredible soundtrack CD, but don't watch this movie!
Queen Mab constantly refers to Paganism as `The Old Ways'.
Something that this film has NOTHING OF!
But how on earth is anyone else supposed to know?
Nothing is ever explained about the history and friction between "the old ways" and christianity.
I had no trouble understanding that she was referring to Paganism because I have knowledge of this subject.
The dialogue and acting throughout the entire film is absurdly lame(very, very bad).
That's it.
For almost 4 hours!
And what do we associate with Merlin?
When you watch this, remember it is called MERLIN.
The film falls flat on almost every level, apart from the music.
This film has been described as a `Family Movie' but I can't think of one reason why any kids would want to watch this 3 1/2+ hour dud.
Nothing kept my interest.
I don't get it.
Magic.

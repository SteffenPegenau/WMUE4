He must have subliminal mind control messages is his whack ass tracks because from start to finish this cd was pathetic.
I'll gladly give you my copy.
Look I love hip-hop music but I've always been a skeptic of these two clowns.
Don't buy.
It's crap.
I know everybody thinks Rakim is the king of rap.
I listen to everything for inspiration.
Point blank range: Uninspiring.
I was right when I was a kid!
I thought I was missing something when I first heard them as a teenager and thought they were whack.
I never felt them.
Everytime I hear that I think, "are these people just being sarcastic or what!"
I'm an underground music producer.
I decided as an adult I'd give another listen.
I ain't lying to you.

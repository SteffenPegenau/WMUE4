it takes away from their originallity.
that's not that good though.
half of the other songs, he sounds like John Lennon.
half the songs on the cd are pretty good.
7/10
it just goes from upbeat to slow over and over again.
but no one knows they don't got much.
but they sound too much like other bands.
good enough to make them a top band in the rise of indie rock.
even some of their songs could pass as beatles tunes.
But they do hit a couple sweet spots with their title track, Highly Evolved and their leading single, Get Free.
The album is too unbalanced.
The vines are taking the charts and hitting america with all they got.
People keep saying the lead singer, Craig Nicholls, sounds like Kurt Cobain, but he really only sounds like him on their single, Get Free, which is an excellent song.
but if you really like the beatles and really like indie rock then buy this cd.
it's not that it's bad that they sound just like the beatles it's bad that they sound just like another band.

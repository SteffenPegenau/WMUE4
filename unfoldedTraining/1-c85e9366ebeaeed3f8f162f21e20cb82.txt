After waiting 90 days, yes you heard me right...
Well I saw the Perfect Pancake on TV and ordered one right away.
I like mini chopper that came with it free!
It may have been a perfect idea but not a perfect product!

One good thing came out of it...
Thanks Perfect Pancake for adding new meaning to the saying: If it sounds to good to be true, then it ain't!
OK, like most of us, you see a new invention on TV and you spontaneously agree that it's amazing and you buy the invention.
I waited three months to get it, I came to the conclusion that that this is an item I can live without.
The non stick stuff came off within the 3rd or 4th use.
Here are the problems!
I thought is was a good idea until I used it!!!
The batter thingy would not stop pouring because it gets stuck.

It does not cook evenly, even in low heat the pancake was brunt.

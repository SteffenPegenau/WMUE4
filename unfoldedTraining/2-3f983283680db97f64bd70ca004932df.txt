Very outdated info.
But, John Shaws Closeups has much more and accurate information for the average photographer.
He has nothing to say about Nikon bodies & equiptment.
Just received this book.
Who cares or has the money to do microphotography.
Geographic issuesDon't wate your money!
We don't have access to National Geographics photography equipment.
If you want some great pictures (which this book has) go to previous Natl.
His formulas for magnification rates are dead wrong.

Very wordy and nonsensical information that you can get from any general photography book.The quality of the photos and paper is very nice.
There is also a new book that I just ordered that was just published and reccomended by Shutterbug for just $16.
Uses very expensive equiptment that the average photographer cannot afford.

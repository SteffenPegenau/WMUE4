It is strictly toning, so you arent going to get fit owning only this one tape.
I ordered the xtra lite tone up, because I havent done any formal exercise in about 12 yrs.
Need a lite backup for days you cant work out as heavily as usual?
So I was out of shape.
You can increase the intensity of the workout by using heavier weights, or adding ankle weights.
Good instruction from Ms Austin as well.
It was almost TOO lite.
Just had a baby?
I have been a fan of Denise Austin for years.
But still a very worthwhile video for your library.
This is the tape for you.
I enjoyed it, I used 3 lb weights which was perfect for me.
Havent worked out in a long time?
Or on days that you maybe have a cold and dont feel that well, but dont want to miss your workout.
Concentrates on posture, and how to exercise correctly.
I would like to add some ankle weights, because the lower body workout was too easy.
It is perfect for those days that you are sore from overdoing the previous day.

I'm a traveler and thus prefer the noticably smaller and lighter SD400.
If you are putting value in the movie feature, be sure to audition the camera before buying.Update: 9 April 2005 - This camera is taking some really excellent outdoor photos.
The unit must be repaired.
I must wait until I return to the US.
If you intend to keep a camera in your pocket all the time, consider the SD400.Update: 20 August 2005 - Disaster.
Unfortunately, I'm traveling and Canon doesn't offer an international repair.
I'm able to take non-flash photos.
However, in hindsight, I'd rather have the SD400.
Excellent camera with a really annoying flaw.I was forwarned by the forums at dpreview.com that movie audios have an annoying hiss.
I would buy this camera again.
No problem there at all.
Canon support has been really excellent.
Outdoor photos continue to be really terrific.
The flash has stopped working.
Sure enough, my unit does too.

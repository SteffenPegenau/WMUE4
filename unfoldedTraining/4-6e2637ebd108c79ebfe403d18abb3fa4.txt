He lists everything in a chronilogical order, which helped me keep track as the events unfolded.
It isn't the same as this book.
This book was great.
This book kept me thinking about it long after I put it down.
There is another version of this book at the Kenton County Library, Covington.
I believe the author wrote it before finding a publisher.
He did a great job of research.
At first the story seemed unreal.
I had trouble sleeping the first night after replaying it in my mind.
It is titled "Terror at Music World"
I plan on checking it out next.
But, the author thought so to at first.
I have always been fascinated by ghosts and especially the haunting of this local bar.
It appears to be a homemade copy and wasn't published.
It is the same story but the chapters don't match up to this book.
There is also a nice appendix of affidavits, pictures, references to support the history, and a bar layout map.

James Bond has always had classic memorable villians.
But also another draw back is that there was no Female villian.
Craig is again awesome as James Bond.
One thing that has stayed consistant is the beautiful women.
And this movie feels like an extention of that movie.
I'm already looking forward for the next Bond Movie.
And the short guy in this movie was not scary or intimidating and not memorable.
I loved Casino Royale.
I hope Craig stays on for a long time.
(It's really tough to beat Sean Connery).
The only thing that holds this movie back a little was the villian.
I really like this movie.
And James Bonds needs a challange.
Pretty darn close to be the best James Bond of the whole series.
There is nothing hotter than a dangerous Bond Girl.
Quantum of Solace definitely has hot women.

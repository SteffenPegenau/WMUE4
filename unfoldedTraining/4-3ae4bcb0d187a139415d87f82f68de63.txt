If you were on the table slated for a lobotomy, how would you get out of it?
RAH!
Maggie does pretty well.
Perhaps even oblivious reviewers?
OK, it's not likely in real life.
This mystery is quite true to the genre.
Oh la la la.
Besides, there are good sex scenes.
I went to a school in Virginia which fancied itself a "seven-sisters-of-the-south."
It's FUN and it's over the top.
It's kinda fun.
But why the hell do we read this stuff?
Hm.This mystery is totally worth it for the lobotomy scene.
If in doubt, seek refuge at the President's house...once you have managed to get off the table, find something to wear, and escape the hospital.
Yes, the original frame-up is pretty obvious -- but who hasn't known totally oblivious people, much less cops?
If you really can't consider people named "Pudgie" as real individuals, then pass on by...but if they seem like human beings to you, then perhaps you should read this.

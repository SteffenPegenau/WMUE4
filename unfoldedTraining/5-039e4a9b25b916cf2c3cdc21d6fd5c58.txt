This album is an absolute must have for Prog or Prog-Metal fans.
Symphony X is awesome!
There is just so excellent musicianship in here, it would take forever!
Shows how much I know!
Romeo can pull of some pretty amazing stuff!
The longest one is like 3 minutes.
All the harmony stuff is cool.
The only bad thing is, is the the intstrumental (segue) tracks are way too short.
So just go and buy it!
I always though Prog was dead a long time ago!
The music has a wide range from classical to metal.
Those instrumental tracks are amazing.
The lyrics as much as the music are "proggy."
In my opinion, is sounds like Yes, ELO, and Metallica rolled into one.
(sorry, I jacked up my last review).

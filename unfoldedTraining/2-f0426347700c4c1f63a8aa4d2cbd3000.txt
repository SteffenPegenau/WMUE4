Third - absolute unacceptable use of computer graphics.
Grant it - transferring Gods and Generals to the big screen was more of a challenge.
I want to like this movie.

How can you depict the first half of the Civil Ware and SKIP SHARPSBURG!
First - NO ANTIETAM.
Ron Maxwell should say, "It's all my fault!"
Although Gettysburg did show signs of this, Gods went overboard.
The movie Gettysburg was a faithful onscreen rendition of Michael Shaara's The Killer Angels.
Like a very bad made for TV movie.

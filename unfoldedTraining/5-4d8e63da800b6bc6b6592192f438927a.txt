(note LL, your man can still produce, maybe you need to get him to lace tracks for you again.)
The only complaints I have is the songs Stand Up and Hold Ground are some wack songs.
How come this album didn't get any kind of exposure?
One, it has Marley Marl behind the beats.
If not, continue to support wack artist like Nelly, Chingy, Lil Flip and G-Unit.
The best is Follow Me Up, the Marley Marl remix.
He was pretty good.
Get this, support true hip hop.
Hold Ground has the most corniest chorus.
Also One Shot Deal where Pop and two MC's, which I have no idea who, doesn't sound like the GP Wu members, rip it up.
I'm not saying on GP's album he was bad.
It looks like from the time he was with GP Wu till this album came out, he polished up his skills.
But other than that, this album is strong.
I think Marley even gets a verse in.
But on this album, damn, he's spitting fire.
There are plenty of Underground Cats that do get exposure, and Pop should have been one of them.

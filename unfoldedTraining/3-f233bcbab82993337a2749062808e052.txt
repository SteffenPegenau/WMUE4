The graphics and AI are also improved upon from the Live Series.
Sure, I knew the game would not offer a season or a dynasty mode, but I bought it anyway.
Next time include the missing game modes and INCLUDE MID-MAJOR Div.
The gameplay is actually pretty good.
Unlike the Live series, if you make a bad pass it will get deflected and stolen.
is by far the biggest detraction from the overall quaility of the game.
Wait until the next installment is released.
If you plan on playing this game mostly in Single-player mode, forget it.
The lack of a season mode(for crying out loud!)
You won't find open point guards dribbling around the top of the key until the shot clock runs down.

Where are my Ball State Cardinals?!?!
No, they drive to the basket and shoot in MM.
1 teams!
You're getting closer, EA.

No wars?
I've been required to read this book for my reading class.
But 'The Giver' shouldn't have recievedthat award.
I'm glad to have my memories and I don't want toforget them.
It definatelycreates mood in the story of sarrow and pain.
We took quizzes onit and discussed the book.
But that's just my opinion.
Ijust don't like the storyline.
What's the point in life if everything has to beperfect.
No memories?
The only reason why I'm giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 isbecause Lois did a good job on descibing the characters and what's going on.
No competition, and you're assigned your future job, your child(s),and your spouse.
Now, her other book 'Number the Stars' was fantasticand I rate that a 5 because it's also based on true events.
How Pathetic.
Why would someone want to live in thatkind of place?
I really didn't enjoy reading what I read because it'sabout the future with a perfect society.

You have to let it charges for a while.
After I opened the package.
It made me considered about buying it.
I thought of two words on my mind.
Good price.
(everytime when I bought stuff online) "Satisfied" or "Disappointed".
I smiled all day long.Nice watch!!!
(Good function,though!
!A few things want to mention you all, The watch is a little bit smaller than I expected (But it's not a promblem because my wrist it's so small(6").it fits me perfectly)Don't be panic about the watch doesn't work at the first time.
!
I have been looking for a new dress watch for a month.
Buy for yourself or as a gift.
You will be happy anyway.Love it!
I've got it today.
(I am kind of a fussy person).
I decided to buy this one.
you don't need to worry about changing baterries)I love the lobster claw-clasp because I can adjust it myself.
(I always got a problem about paying extra for adjusting the band)Well..I'd recommend this watch to anybody.
I saw this watch and read the reviews .

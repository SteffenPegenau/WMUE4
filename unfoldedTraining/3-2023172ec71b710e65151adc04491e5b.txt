If you have to re-watch season 1 to do it, then by all means, do SOMETHING.
Not enough action.
The formula is disintegrating at the roots for season 2.
It seems that's happened, so, I'm back, but was bored with this ep.
Just waiting for her to get written out.
This is an action show.
To the writers, producers...get your game back on track.
We need what made season 1 so damn good.
Now we can get back to what made season 1 kick ass.
I'm going to go check out the others.
Too much time dealing with background explanation.
But, the bickering between Steve and Danno...ahhhhh, good to have that back, though in this ep.
This episode was slow, though.
Not enough vision in my opinion.
I've stopped watching the show because of the blonde.
there wasn't near enough.
Ok, just glad the blonde chick on the team is gone.

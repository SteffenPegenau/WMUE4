Also changed the check vavle and nothing is better.
8 months after the purchase the compressor slows down to almost nothing after 60 psi.
I bought a brand new C.H.
Campbell Hausefield is a piece of junk.
They will not sell me a replacement start or run capacitor only a $200 motor.
If you want a compressor that is not designed to break in little more than a year go with an Ingersal Rand.
It is lop-sided and wobbles badly.
maybe.
absolute junk IMO!
The pulley is not close to being true.
Found capacitors for it somewhere else but still have problem.
Customer support is awful.
If you are going to use it 2 or 3 times a year it might last for 3-5 years.
AWFUL!
can not even tighten the screws at factory, can't make a true pulley, can not say one good thing about it.
and 2 months in the set screw for the pulley fell out and rattled around then got lost.

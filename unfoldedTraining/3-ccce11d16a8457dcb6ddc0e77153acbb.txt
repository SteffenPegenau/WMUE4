It is annoying.
This one, not so much.
You have press one, do the whole thing, wait for the DVD to reset and then press the next one.
On this DVD I find I have to do all three workouts together.
Maybe if you are more beginner than this would be a good DVD to start with.
The workouts are too short.
But there isn't an option to play all three in a row.
In all I will use it as one workout but it isn't what I expected.
20 min just isn't enough.
This is the first Jillian product I have ever been disappointed in.
I am surprised how great the reviews are for this dvd.
I liked how in Shed and Shred you can play both workouts without having to go back to the main menu.
I have all of Jillian's DVDs and I have always loved them.
It isn't at all like 30 Day Shred where you can work out for 20-30 min and feel like you worked out.
If you do that, than yes, it is a good DVD.
Still love her other DVDs though and will still continue to be a huge Jillian Michaels fan.

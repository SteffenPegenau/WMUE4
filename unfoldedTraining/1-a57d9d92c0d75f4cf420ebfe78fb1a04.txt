The information that they provide is the most worthless.
I have dish network but couldn't download the programming for it.
I would strongly recommend using something else for dish customers.
Always get to 92% download and unexcepted error.
Each time I called I got a different answer to my problem.
One said it was the replaytv unit fault, another said it was my network, another said it was the server and the other three didn't know.
No one fixed my problem.
I could download Directtv without any problem and if you use cable or a antena the you are in good shape.
I bought the replaytv and I called the tech support 6 times.
The problem was the same error 93a6000b.
The wait for the support is the best I have seen the longest wait is like 1 minute.
Did not work with dish.
They didn't listen to what was happening.
[]was excellent on shipping to me and getting me another one.
The biggest waste of my time I have spent.
I wouldn't recommend to anyone with dish.

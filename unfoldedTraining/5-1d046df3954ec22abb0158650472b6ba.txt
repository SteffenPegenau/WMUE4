I died for you is a great balld from The Dark Saga.
Then there's the very emontial Watching Over Me, which is the best Iced Earth song in concert.
This is really good songs you wont find anywhere else.
Then the classic Black Sabbath cover Electric Funeral from 1970's Paranoid.
And finally, the best way to hear them live, the live version of Colors from their first album!
I've heard the original before, and Iced Earth's version burns it too the ground.
Excellent intro!
Iced Earth are the kings of true metal.
Great solo, great lyrics.
The EP starts with Melancholy, possibly the best ballad off Something Wicked This Way Comes, and possibly the best Iced Earth song yet.
I hope you like it too!
Then there is an amazing Bad Company cover of Shooting Star.
And, the Judas Priest classic, The Ripper, from sad Wings Of Destiny.
Just perfect!
I never thought that they could do this, but it's amazing.
It RULES!
Such a great E.P.!

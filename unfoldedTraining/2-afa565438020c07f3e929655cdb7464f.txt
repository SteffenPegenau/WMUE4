SERIOUSLY!
Wow.
Honestly, I have heared this same souped up story numerous times in many other anime.
NOT RECCOMENDED.
I've never seen or heared anything like it before.
is a graphic/anime novel...)But, this one was just plain stale.
I forced myself to get it over w/ but couldint even finsih the last five pages, or so.
Also, it was just plain boring.
A teenage girls life turns topsy-turvy, and she falls in love w/ two differnt people (w/one whos older than her).
The main difference is that that turned out to be great, when I thought it would be slutsy... (And also, I.N.V.U.
I will admit, I really only got this because I liked how the author drew the charectors on the cover.
NOT.
How totally unique.
I learned not to judge a book by its cover long ago w/ Daupne Du Mauriers Rebecca, w/ its sleazy looking cover.
GET SOMETHING FUNNY AND DIFFERNT LIKE RANMA 1/2.

What in God's name is he doing?
I usually don't write reviews, but I sort of wanted to write one in response to the person from Whippany, NJ who said he couldn't find the movie anywhere on the two discs!
He does have a DVD player, yes?
Is this person for real?
It's just optimism and love run amok.
Come on, it's "Forrest Gump."
Anyway, for the rest of you who have no trouble operating a remote control, this is a fantastic film.
Well, I suppose everyone is entitled to their opinion.
Possibly the most enjoyable film ever made.
My God.
He's not attempting to view these discs with a VCR, is he?
Great cast.
Leonard Maltin doesn't know what he's talking about in saying he didn't buy Hank's performance.
Obviously.
I think, in most everyone's opinion, "Forrest Gump" is a great American film.
Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise are a perfect odd couple, and Robin Wright-Penn is stunning, even when she's doped-up and cracked-out in the 1960's.
When you can find it.

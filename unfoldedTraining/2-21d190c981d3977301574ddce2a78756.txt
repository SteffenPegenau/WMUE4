I think it's great that this woman stands so strongly behind her convictions and she is clearly a very talented poet.
Otherwise I'd just like to read Alix's poems.
Sorry, but I think thats kind of lame.
I honestly could not tell the difference.
She is great at sounding like her.
I can't listen to Alix.
I just wonder why talented artists who clearly have an abundance of creativity cannot find their own voices and instead insist upon copying Ani Difranco's style.
If I want Ani, I'll listen to her.
However, hearing her recite them is like listening to someone trying to mimick Ani Difranco.
It happens to often and it is just..kind of lame.
What happened to originality?
This makes the album painful for me to listen to.
Clearly, Alix is an amazing poet.
I think she is extremely talented...yet this whole business of stealing Ani's style...
I can't stand it.

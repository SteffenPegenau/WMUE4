Guess where the keys were?
I'm very pleased.
Only one problem.
Open all of the other latches, then kind of line up the top a bottom and push down a little bit (not too hard) above the locked latch and giggle the latch until it opens.
One of the locks actually locks and needs a key.
My dreadnought fits inside perfectly.
Seriously?
Someone else had this problem and left a comment about how to get it open.
If it wasn't for that, I would have given it 5 stars.
It's more than what I was expecting for the price.
The interior is plush, black padding.
I received my guitar case today - I just ordered it 2 or 3 days ago - so really fast shipping.
Mine doesn't seem to have a problem lining up the top and bottom like others have mentioned.
Lots of room in the compartment for strings, strap, and other accessories.
Yep - inside the case.

Or Neo's conversation with the Oracle in the park, now that had some truly bad dialogue.
I keep hearing from people who were confused during this movie.
Of course it was.
It makes me sad that so many are depriving themselves of an amazing movie, but that's alright, I loved it and strongly urge others to see it for themselves.
Now that was a lot of long-winded crap.
Revolutions is so much more advanced than Reloaded.
However, the series was about Neo, and Neo's story was resolved.
Neither The Matrix or the machines were destroyed, this is true.
Series not resolved?
And who keeps saying there wasn't enough action?
It was an incredible film.
Were they in the bathroom the whole time the machines were attacking Zion?
I don't know.
Reloaded had so much more senseless babble that went on and on.
Remember the scene with the Architect in Reloaded?
How?
What's the problem folks?
Why is this one so hard for people to swallow?
And what was there to not get?
I don't understand that.

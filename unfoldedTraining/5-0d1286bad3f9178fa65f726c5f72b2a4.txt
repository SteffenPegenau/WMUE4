She knew exactly what she was getting in to and what was expected of her.
She saw dollar signs, as I felt her parents did, and went after it.
finally someone took the time to dig under the surface.
You read in books that Elvis molded Priscilla to the way she is today.
Priscilla comes off as this bewildered, all suffering person.
How could her mother do that to her?
Even in the face of her own words, Priscilla denies the obvious.
I recommend this book to anybody who wants to know the Priscilla truth.
Can you imagine finding the answers to your questions in the bottom of a trunk?
I loved this book.
This book points to that.
Her mother taught her to keep secrets, not to talk about nothing.
I find that laughable!
From watching interviews and reading stories Priscilla gave, I always felt deep down that she didn't care for Elvis.
Superb reading!
I did feel for Priscilla about discovering her real parentage.

Everything I have thought about as I journey through life being an artist is covered in this book.
What do artists think about stuff?
So I bought a second one from Amazon.
It seems that all artists share the same thoughts and concerns and this book puts it all into understandable context.
It's in here.
Then I lost the book.
It is the best book about art that I've read, even though it is little and unassuming.
My new copy is also filled with notes.
I read it three times on a recent European trip.
I'm an artist.
My first copy was given to me by a vey good friend, who is also an artist.
it is clearly written, interesting, not academic in style, and fun to read.
I couldn't stop reading it.
I filled the pages with notes and observations.
I've recommended it to students and friends who are artists.

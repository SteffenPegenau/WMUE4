!
i am even going to go out on a limb and compare this (the way its set up) to the chronic.
well that is what the doc is doing.the production on this project is real good.
yeah u heard me, the chronic.
i did not even consider getting this album at all at first.
without his voice.
remember how dre introduced the world to tha row and the dogg pound?
the doc has found himself 3 snapping young guns (6'2, two face, and deville) from texas.
u would think since its kind of an unoticed by mainstream release, that the beats would suffer but that is not the case.
i mean come on the d.o.c.
he has cube, dre, ren, baby, and snoop on this one.
two face has real good gangsta muszick wordplay and deville is the pimp juice.
go get this album, U HAVEN'T LEFT YET!!!!
6'2 ride tracks just like snoop does and he has way better lyrics.
but i was curious and i am glad i found this treasure.

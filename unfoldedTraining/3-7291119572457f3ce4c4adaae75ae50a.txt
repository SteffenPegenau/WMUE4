Only Mushishi can see them.
I recently started to watch the Anime Series - Mushishi.
"Mushi" means worm in Japanese.
Actually, here the worm is more a legendary creature, a type of microorganism.
The rest of the CD is pure music.
You can see the musician made a lot of efforts when creating music for the Anime.
Each episode has its own theme.
You know, easy on human ears.
Invisible to ordinary people.
The music has the same effect on me.
However the music catches my ears.
The opening song - The Sore Feet Song (by Ally Kerr) is very "Simon and Garfunkel".
It is very quiet music, which matches the style of the Anime.
A tint of green always mesmerizes me when I watching Mushishi.
Very relaxing.
The musician's name is Toshiro Masuda.
When watching Mushishi, it is like going into a world of Classical Chinese Paintings.
In my opinion, "Mushishi" doesn't presents audience a great story.

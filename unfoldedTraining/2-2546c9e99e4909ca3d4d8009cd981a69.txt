I'm just disappointed.
Maybe it's the pressure.
And if this is your favorite album of theirs, you just don't get it.
Now, I think with this album they've turned into a big crowd-pleasing bore.
Then they won me back with Catastrophe, which is one of their best.
Maybe it's the production.
The songs are lively without life and the lyrics are mundane and cheesy.
I was the biggest, hugest, most excited Belle and Sebastian fan, EVER.
I ignored all the hipsters who were catching on to them too late without knowing what they were getting into.
I watched everything get reissued and become less and less of a "secret".
They made a great comeback.
This is not the same band.
I even continued to follow them after Fold Your Hands, Child....which was not their best.
But guys, this ISN'T it.
They need to call it quits and step back for a bit.
And all the changes in lineups and spinoffs.

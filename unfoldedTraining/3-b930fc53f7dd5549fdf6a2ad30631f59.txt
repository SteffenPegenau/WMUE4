Not comfortable calling it "high quality".
I started by putting a totally discharged Canon BP511 battery (with no so-called "memory" build-up) in it.
Well, yes.
I left the battery to charge several hours just in case.
Was the battery fully charged?
Doesn't work for me.
There are three valued printed on the charger housing: 0, 50, 100.
I removed and reseated the battery several times.
The indicator is supposed to be a nlinking light indicator that functions as time indicator of how much charging time is left.
Does the charger do its job?
There's not much to say about the CB-5L.
My problem is with the charge level indicator.
Who knows!
A "red" indicator light came on which immediately turned steadily green.
That's my 2 cents on it.
I bought the Canon CB-5L after the cheap knockoff I got on ebay died a week after I got it.
Maybe my charger is defective.The charging unit feels light and flimsy.

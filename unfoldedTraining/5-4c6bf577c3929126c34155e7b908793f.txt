Not to mention the very well done documentary on Kubrick's life.
They also should of included the slip cases with the poster art that are on each movie if you buy them individual.
They look fantastic.
This DVD presentation is how it should look.
The Clockwork Orange widescreen laser disc released 12 years ago fell short.
Especially the Shining bonus disc.
All his best and most memorable films are here and the bonus discs for each movie are incredible.
Malcolm Mcdowell's audio commentary on A Clockwork Orange is very interesting.
Other than that it's great.
But...whatever.
I never get tired of watching this collection.
He tells little stories and rare facts about the filming and what went on.
Warner could of done a better job boxing up the set instead of the half assed flimsy cardboard casing.
It's also nice to see these films presented in the original theatrical aspect ratio.
If you are a Kubrick fan, then buy this set!

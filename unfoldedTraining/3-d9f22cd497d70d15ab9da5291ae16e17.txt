I bought this cd a few weeks ago.
Elton's voice on this sounds even better than Songs From The West Coast which I would give 5 stars to.
His guitar work has always been what gives Eltons songs there kick.
That was really Elton and Bernies comeback CD.
Great music all the way through.
I think that it's actually very sad.
I actually don't blame Elton or Bernie for this fact.
For my money buy SFTWC from a few years ago.
My gripe here is Davey Johnson.
And here it sounds like he just came in and did it by the numbers.
When I first listened to it I thought it was pretty good but that was it.
In my opinion this really could have been a classic.
They both do a great job here.
It never did grow on me like it has for other people.
His guitar work here is very substandard for him.
Nice try guys but at least it is better than the 80's and 90's stuff.
Very worthy of there 70's output.

It is not worth the price, I can guarrantee you.
This game is fun.
OK!
Wave Race 64.
You get 8 courses, 4 players, create your custom jet ski, go into a championship, play againts your best friend.... and it's over.
You can only have 2 players max.
I can't kill it too hard because it was one of the first games, but it's just too short.
Game over!Wave Race 64 is a great game.
The custom made boards arn't really custom, you just choose between 3 factors, and you can do 3 tricks!
Wow.
One of Nintendo's first game.
(Which, during racing, give you no bonus except if you don't complete the trick, making you fall in the water and get behind) This game get's old within 1 hour.
Updated from v1.1.
Only 1 player Championship which is 4 EASY tracks.
Amazing.
Wave Race is nothing special.

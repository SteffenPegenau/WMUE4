It works with color and the harsh realities of the character Max.
He did a good job in the underrated The Happening and does some good stuff here too.
There are some typical themes like evil shady corporation, tough chick with an attitude and die hard lead character.
It's that good.
But It works because of the pacing of the film.
Also I didn't even no it was a video game until after I saw it.
This movie was pretty dark.
You should watch the film just to see him go crazy.
I recommend this slick film.
There is an excellent creepy vibe to the movie that is hard pull off.
He literally goes insane near the end of the film.
But he does have his moments.
He is a tortured person.
And he is trying to find out who the killer is.
with having his wife and newborn slashed up by junkies.
A few moments of his mind just shattering is one his finer moments of his career.
Probably wouldn't have watch it if I known that before.
Wahlburg is a poor actor.

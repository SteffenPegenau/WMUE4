That's a promise.
Thrashed?
This music makes me happy, you too is my hope.
You take your 2-4 beers, your macrame lawn chair & your Saturday afternoon, plop yerself down by the cow-laden backyard grill, drop the needle on that puppy and sail away.
Yep.
"Mope-A-Long", less polished, more languid than the "Still Lookin'Good" version, "Get To Leave", here but a lowfi seed, yet to bloom on SnoAngel.
"Blue Waltz Reprise" flows in and out, low tide now, wait 5 minutes for hidden track "Rolling Stones I Am".
Highlight is the meandering "BBQ Suite" .
"Lean", the GiantSandiest of the bunch.
You bet.
It's a BBQ, afterall.
By the time "Lester The Lampshade" comes about, that 2nd (or 3rd) beer is doomed and you're grinning.
Trashed?
A nearly perfect set, the feel is equal parts GiantSand and Blacky Ranchette.
"You gotcha (only) so many days here on the planet"-HG
Here's homage, nasty, lowdown dirty blues, Howe-style.

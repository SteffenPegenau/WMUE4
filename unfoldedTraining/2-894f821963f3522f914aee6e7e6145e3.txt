That paragraph really made me wonder about the whole book.
This book is very informative.
Non-fiction?
On one page alone(small pages) the word SEAL is mentioned 16 times.
This may have impressed Mr. Couch or maybe he is just trying to impress the reader, but that is not good shooting skill.
If you have read alot or know alot about the SEALs then skip the first 38 pages.
Dick Couch is a good, not great, writer and is very detailed and I was really enjoying his book until I read his account, on page 183, of a close-quarters firefight in which he describes how good these particular SEALs could shoot because they had shot the bad guys weapon and his hands holding the weapon.
The author really loves the SEALs.
Did I mention that?
Dick Couch is a former SEAL.
He loves the SEALs.
If you have never read a book about SEALs then this is an excellent place to start.
This book is a good look(although limited)at modern-day SEALs.
This isn't an old TV western.
Fiction?

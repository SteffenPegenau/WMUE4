I didn't roll in toward the middle!
Our daughter added a $25 foam mattress pad that greatly increased our comfort and warmth.
The built-in pump worked great.
Great purchase!
I definitely recommend the foam pad.
We also used king-size fitted sheet that was recommended by another reviewer.

My husband is 6'1" and weighs about 230 and I weigh 115.
We added only a little air two or three.
We slept very well for 12 nights.
No leaks, great comfort.
We slept on this mattress during our 12-day stay in VA during the Christmas holidays.
This air mattress was more comfortable than many hotel mattresses.
This Queen-size high-rise mattress was shipped to our daughter's home in Virginia.
Easy set-up and quick take-down.

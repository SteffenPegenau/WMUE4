What an experience, to look at life and death from this whole new perspective.
I appreciate all the finish work put into this, which is all too rare these days in publishing.
The language reminds me of WHITE OLEANDER in which the author used words and metaphors in new ways to make us see in new ways.
I read it basically in one sitting -- I simply couldn't put it down.
And it makes you think.
I hated to see it end.
And think again.
It's very well written and well edited.
And it is beautifully put together.
In fact, I found myself crying.
An astounding book.
Such a good read!
Fun, tense, quiet, reflective, horrifying, sad, peaceful, joyful, loving.
I can't get over how excellent this book is -- it's a fine, fine work of art that will last a long time in the literary world.
THE LOVELY BONES is like a symphony with not a note out of place.
And feel.
Everything about the book is finely polished.
I find myself recommending this book to more and more people.

damn, memories of my youth.
I got emotional when my girl pulled the vid on youtube- back in the video music box days on ch39- lol!
now go check out diamond d's album and The Fu-Schnickens.
I listen to a lot of Gospel Hip Hop now but this remains one of my favorite albums of the 90's.
Ahhhh memory lane.
Yes u can love hip hop and have fun and be happy!
to each his own.
This reminds me of sunny days and playing in the fire hydrant, staying up at the park playing ball all nite, mom calling me out the window for dinner, when my old neighborhood was a community.
And these guys are not throwing curses every 3 bars.
am I overdoin it?
I'm not an ignorant kid anymore - and I hate artists bragging about dope dealin.
it took a while to finally find it on CD.
this album reminded me of why I fell in love with hip hop .
Listen and judge for yourself because I STILL bump this and smile.
It was beautiful, dynamic, real, jazzy.
I had this on tape and lost it in a move.

Although this watch is stamped "Swiss made" on the case, and the box is clearly labeled "Swiss made" and the warranty clearly says "Swiss made," inside the watch is stamped "Made in China."
Took it to the jeweler for a new battery.
And guess what?
The jeweler told me he could tell immediately as the quality of the steel casing was very steel and poor compared to the real thing.
I was in Germany at the time and tried to get a new battery.
I have gone through two of these watches in two years.
Whether this is counterfeit or what I don't know.
But I won't go there again.
The first one quit a year after I bought it.
Disappointing.
Was told...it's not the battery.
Evidently to get a real "Swiss made" watch you need to pay a lot more than $100.
Was told battery wasn't the problem.
Hadn't saved receipt, warranty, etc...My bad.
Bought another one (at Costco).
It quit after 10 months.

THIS KEYBOARD DOES NOT HAVE SPEAKERS!!!!!
.
You have to buy them seperatley!!!
You would have to pay over 1500 for a keyboard this good anywhere else.
Any you have to get special headphones.
I bought this keyboard to take with me to college.
Even beethoven himself couldn't imagine how great the moonlight sonata could sound on this keyboard!!!!!!!
It is still an amazing piano!!!!
This keyboard is definatly everything I was looking for .
I shopped around forever for a great keyboard.
BUT there was one minor glitch when I got it out of the box.
But it doesn't say anywhere on the product info that you need headphones or speakers to attach.
This keyboard really is made for people who are in bands and the like.
I love playing it!
Still love this keyboard though.
.
I was looking for something that would be portable, but play like the real piano I had to leave at home.
It has a great feel.

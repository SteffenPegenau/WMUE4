I bought #2 in December '09.
But within the month it ceased to function.
It worked great.
No explanation.
The replacement unit arrived/an exchanged was made in mid January '10.
I bought it for my son's upstairs bedroom (it's the attic area of an older home so chilly in winter).
It also heated a room of about 100 sq ft. very nicely.
Heated an area about 300 SQ FT nicely.
Just stopped working one day.
Overall I would recommend this unit for small to medium sized rooms.
But it was a little disappointing that unit #2 only lasted a month.
I purchased my first DeLonghi Oil-Filled Radiator in about October '09.
He liked it so I decided to by a second for his rumpus room in the basement where there is no heat but he and his friends spend a lot of time playing video games etc.
So far so good.
Very disappointing.
I did return to Amazon for replacement.
Amazon was great about the exchange.

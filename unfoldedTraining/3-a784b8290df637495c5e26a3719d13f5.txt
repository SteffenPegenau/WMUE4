A cheaper simpler wheel would work better.I haven't played the game much myself.
No "damage" to the car, just keep on driving.
"game controls" it was called I think, seemingly nothing to do with steering but you had to program those too for the wheel.
it's good entertainment for the kids.
Got the game for my kids... who are 2 and 4.
Good enough for them.
Which by the way has no force feedback.
The game has modes where you can do just that.
Just centering, no bumps.
So teh fun is not interrupted when the car stops working.
My force feedback wheel was a total pain to get working, until I learned that there was one more page of controls to enter in the settings.
maybe another setting somewhere.
My wheel has a "realistic" over 360degree turning range, that's probably it.
A little too young to race, but they like cruising around aimlessly and crashing into things.
And it takes a lot of wheel turning to make the car turn, not very responsive at all.

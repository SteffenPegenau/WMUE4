Give it a try.
I shop and buy these books for myself to read.
!
He is an unsuspecting hero.
Which I like.
Leven always is surprised.
When they are done, we can chat about them as a family.
Clover is just funny and sooo sweet.
They are very cleverly written.At first I wasn't that sure I was going to like them as Harry Potter is not an easy act to follow.
As an educator and mother, I think that this series is really interesting and quite good.
But, Leven Thumps is endearing.
He gives Leven things and never tells him exactly what it is for.
I tell my children about them and then they ask for them to read.
Just very endearing story lines and characters.

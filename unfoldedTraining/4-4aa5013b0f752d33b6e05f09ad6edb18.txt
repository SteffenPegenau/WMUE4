Also don't expect a very perfect distress finish on this item.
Also watch the prices as they fluctuate quite a bit.
Overall a great little nightstand!
I got mine for about $40.
You might have to do some additional sanding if you want it to look really aged.
I was fine with them as they came though.
This is a good stand to place small decorative items on.
None of the parts were damaged.
I will say that these tables are more for looks than function.
I ordered two of these tables to use as nightstands in my shabby chic room.
I am very happy with this purchase!
It was very easy to put together (no tools needed).
The tables look great next to a bed.
I was looking forever for something not overpriced as most shabby chic items are.
The drawer is a little flimsy so I wouldn't put anything too heavy inside.

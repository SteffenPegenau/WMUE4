I was shocked.
I was working pretty fast too.
I wouldn't run my framer with it, but that's not its purpose.
I'm planning on filing mine down to more of a point.
First, the compressor is really nice.
Used it quite a bit yesterday.
Very quiet!
It keeps up fine with the brad nailer and a stapler I was using.
Light and compact too.
I am very impressed!Now to the nailer.
The nose piece is too wide, making it impossible to sink a nail when toe nailing.
Seems to sink nails otherwise, though.If I could seperate, I would give the compressor 5 stars and the nailer 3.
Compared to my twin stack compressor, this is just a whisper.
It is a good nailer, but falls short on one thing.
I just received this kit a few days ago.

The whole thing was just awful.
Otherwise, prepare to be disappointed.
I say...>SAVE YOUR MONEY and purchase these items in a real brick and mortar store if you can.
it was so embarassing- I had to dress it up big time.
There was one decorative green sprig...that was it.
The bow was tied on the side of the basket instead of the front.
Also, one of the boxes was crushed.
Pathetic!
Everyone I showed it to said, "You paid 90 dollars for THAT???????"
I bought it to donate to a charity for a chinese auction for Breast Cancer/Haiti Relief.
That tiny weeny was pretty disappointing, as was the puny sliver of cheese that is included.
It looks nothing like it does in the picture.
(but the actual basket was nice, I will say that).
I was very disappointed with this "gourmet" basket.
The items are woefully cheap....the crackers were pathetic....one of the packages was open no less.
The itty bitty sausage was wrapped with wrapping paper as though it were some sort of prize!

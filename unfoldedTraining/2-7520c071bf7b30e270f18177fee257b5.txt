.
And yet, it's great to have them.
had some hardcore blues many nights thinking about jeffrey lee pierce after he died.
It's surprising to see how vague and imcomplete they feel when read.
The power, the book proves, is in the music of the Gun Club .
Most read like one offs, not the powerful statements you hear on the records.
It's a one-day read, really slight.
but there's nothing there, man.
.
There is some insight into the punk chaos (you had to be there to know Pierce hits this chord right), but is that enough?
It rambles.
Well, I had waited with great anticipation for this one.
The lyrics without the songs behind them carry so much less power.
the presentation, the fierce heart .
Just not a lot of book here, I'm afraid.
.
Everyone else, please, buy the records.
.but the heart, the book shows, was inarticulate in most ways outside the music.
It's juvenile, high schoolish.
For the most faithful of the faithful.

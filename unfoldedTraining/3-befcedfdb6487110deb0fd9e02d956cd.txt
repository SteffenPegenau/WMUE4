Charlie McCoy's rendition of Shenandoah is hauntingly beautiful and Orange Blossom Special is a virtuoso performance.
The last two tracks on the album are clearly the best.
Unfortunately, they are not.
I don't mind country-wetsren per se but I have to admit I can't stand the sound of the sliding steel guitar.
Third, this CD is definitely "old country western" in style.
It's like listening to fingernails being scraped across a blackboard.
I wish the rest of the tracks were equally strong.

Unfortunately, there is a LOT of sliding steel guitar on this CD.
I found the album to be dissappointing.
Shenandoah and Orange Blossom Special almost make it worth the cost of the CD .
I kept wondering when I was going to hear a harmonica.
almost.
Second, the orchestrations weren't very impressive.
As someone who is just learning to play the harmonica, I was anxious to acquire a couple of CDs featuring this instrument.
First, the harmonica was barely featured in a couple of the tracks.

Borrow it from a friend, not worth the price in my opinion.
The rest of the multitude of bands sound like 80 throwbacks.
A nicely done package with little inside.
Problem with gothic has always been it's pretentiousness.
Nothing really innovative or original.
Cleopatra has already released a variety of dull gothic compilations, why do this again?
Pink Dots, Delerium, Fields of Nephilim, Boyd Rice, etc.
Most of it is available.
This package falls into the awful category.
If you are a true collector of these folks and expect to get something new or really rare, forget it.
Biggest names are Bauhaus (In the Flat Field), Leg.
Some quite good (tribute to pink floyd and gong's YOU remixed) and others awful.
Over 50 bands contribute to this.
Cleopatra Records produces a wide variety of compilations.
I am sure there is something in here for everyone, but not everyone will love all of this material.

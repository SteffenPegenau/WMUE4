I can say this is the first time I have ever used a straighter and I started smiling at how wonderful it turned out.
I recenlty purchased this product for myself and I love it!
Within a hour using the switch I was done and it looked amazing.
I have extrememly course, curly and super thick hair.
I LOVE this product!
Until now, the switch it is amazing.
It is time saving and does a superior job of straightening and flipping.
If feels smoother, shiny, and soft.
Now I can easily style my hair with 20 to 45 minutes.
Just remember to style with your hair dry (not for damp/wet hair) and have fun.
Yeehaw If I could hug the inventor I would.
(it's been compared to lambs wool and a brillo pad in texture).
Anyway straightening my hair has always been a nightmare.
Thank you!
Normally it takes me about 2 or more hours to just straighten my hair.

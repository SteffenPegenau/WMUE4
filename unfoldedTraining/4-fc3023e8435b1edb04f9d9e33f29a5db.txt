Great, awesome find.
And then him manning up was classic, shouting with sloppy manliness, "IT DOESN'T HURT!
I've heard absurd comments about the most trite things in this movie.
It's like when you're flipping through the channels and you come across one of those Demented hospital specials on Discovery.
I had so much fun watching this movie.
Such lines as "Oh S%%%^, am I supposed to feel that?
Even that the Actors are too easy on the eyes!
It's filled with big Stars who knock out their lines.
In small ways it reminded me of a shallow version ofIkiru - Criterion Collection
Hayden was great while inner monologing.
It was silly, in a dark way that was unexpected.
I couldn't watch them split open Hayden Christensen's rib cage.
No, hell no!"
I hate it and can't help but feel something in my own body.
HELL NO!"
While with the rest of this low-key movie is great fun.

The pump inside the unit takes up one plug and also keeps the water cool.
When I fill it up in about a day it needs more water.
It came with 2 charcoal filters to clean the water that your cat drinks.
When I got this product I paid nearly $40 for it.
I've noticed that the charcoal filters only last about a month.
Dont worry the filters are very small.
Now, if your cat spills some food in it or a bug falls in it, it wont filter.
( -1 Four Stars) It will stay in the dish on the bottom and you have to take it out.
( I think they are $6 if you go out and buy a replacement.
Overall I would give it a yay.
You know when it needs more water when you hear the gurgling sound it makes.
If you don't you can return it.
Try it to see if you like it.
(-1 Three Stars)It is very quiet when it is filled with water though.
Also there is a compartment that is blue and stores water, however it hold a very small amount.

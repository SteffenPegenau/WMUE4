Coming from Disney, I was impressed.
Johnny Depp does an amazing job.
It's hard to say because I haven't seen the other movies to compare.
On another note, the filming was incredible.
It took you back to another time and place.
I am sure that had to do with the fact that the first time, I didn't realize Jack Sparrow's character was based loosely on Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones.
It was such a beautiful mood piece.
He didn't even have to speak to make the film funny.
He's so smooth in this.
He was Jack Sparrow.
Very enjoyable.
I think because of his good looks, no one gives him the credit he deserves as an actor.
He should definetely get acknowledged in some way because his take on Jack Sparrow and his acting, were phenonmenal.
Should he get the oscar?
I have seen this movie twice and found it even funnier the second time around.

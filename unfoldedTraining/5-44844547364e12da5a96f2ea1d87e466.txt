The first was that it was directed by Terry Gilliam of Monty Python and the other was the kooky plot and characters.
I did want to get the Special Edition from Anchor Bay, but the Criterion version spotted my eyes first and the rest is history.
Hey, the movie was released in 1981 and you gotta give it that.
I fell in love with it after a couple of viewings.
My uncle first introduced this movie to me a long time ago!
I have to praise Terry Gilliam for directing Heath Ledger in his last role after The Dark Knight.
And the day after tomorrow......
AHAHAHA!!
!
Afterwards I thought it was weird for a couple of reasons.
I have the Criterion DVD of Time Bandits!
THE WORLD!!!
Criterion does a fantastic job with their titles and this one is no disappointment.
But they were reasons to make me watch the movie.
The Criterion DVD is still good by the way.
Despite the non-anamorphic transfer, this is still a good DVD.

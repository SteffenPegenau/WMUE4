I figured it would be safe enough she couldn't harm herself.
Were you able to get rid of the odor??
I now stay away from that brand.
I found it at a major pet store in a nearby town.
I washed it and let it air dry.
I could not get the over powering stench out of it.
Thanks.
I don't know what the deal was with this toy.
It wasn't worth my time or gas money to even bother taking it back.
I just threw it away.
Has anyone else had any kind of experience??
I don't know if that was unusual or what was going on.
As soon as I took it out of the package, it REEKED like some kind of rotten rubber.
I did not purchase through Amazon.
It looked PERFECT for my African Grey Congo.
I was afraid to give it to my parrot.

I don't know what can be done about the grips other than strengthen the skin on your palms.
The little grooves in the handle stick into my weak hands and cause extreme discomfort and with gloves, i'm able to use them without worry about my hands getting hurt.
But darn, they hurt my hands.
Built really sturdy.
I figured i'd do the Trainer as a warm up and then do the Level 1.
I read the reviews and bought both the Trainer and the Level 1.
Eventually I got used to the trainer and I now use the trainer as a warm up and i'm on the Level 1.
Boy was I wrong.
They seem like they'll last for years.
I'm not sure how long i'll be on Level 1 before I move up but I love them.
These are great.
I'll give credit when credit is due.
Nothing looks like it'll rust.
I usually put on my lifting gloves when I use these.
The Trainer was hard.

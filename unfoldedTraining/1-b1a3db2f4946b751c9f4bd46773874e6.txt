Then what about King Arthur or Jorney?
Poor and pretty silly pop with women's chorus and lot of words like "revolution", "freedom", "fight".
Come on, dear fans, is it masterpiece?
The CD is just "red" agition, propaganda, no more!
...
Replete Englishmen fight for freedom under the red flag.
But I'm as Rick and Yes fun expected a little bit more.
Does it have 5 starts rate?
I hoped I find something similar to Rick's "goldern era".
Nothing, but couple of chords...
5% of music and 95% just political calls and mottos.
Well, considering it as a pop album it's ok.
That's fun!
So boring!
So, I returned this CD ... after 3 listening.

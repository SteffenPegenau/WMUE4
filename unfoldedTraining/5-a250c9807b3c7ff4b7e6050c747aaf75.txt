I have a new 30 GB iPod, he has an older 20 GB.
So enjoy!
Believe me, that beats the heck of HP tech support.
Don't let bad info scare you off.
The synching works fine.
I use it on a Gateway, my buddy uses it on an eMachines.
I sent an e-mail to MusicMatch tech support and got a response the next day.
Maybe I'll find some bugs down the road but so far so good.
Also bogus.
I followed up with a clarification and got a response from the same tech a day later.
It works fine.
I read one review that said Music Match Plus would only work with a Dell etc.
As far as the synching, I read one review that said it didn't work etc.
I have Win 2K, he has XP Home.
This is complete nonsense.
I transferred 15 GB's over night and it went well.

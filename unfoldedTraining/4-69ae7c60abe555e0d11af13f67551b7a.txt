You set the workout for as long as you need by choosing the workouts from a menu with it keeping track of the time for you.
They also use a medicine ball but my ball works just as well since it has sand inside so that it does not roll.
She does not keep her count as well and seems to mess up a bit.
I enjoy doing the Functional Flexibilty, Boot Camp, & The Men's Cardio Max.
;)~ I definitely recommend owning a Workout Ball.
However, she does work you!
U can't go wrong for only $10.
I felt as though I had the beautiful runners legs that I have always wanted.
They added the other trainer in and for me.... her voice is a little annoying.
They use it several times in the video.
The Men's Cardio (I am a woman) made me feel as though my legs were going to explode and they felt great afterwards.
I own the 1st TBL DVD and Love it.
I recommend this video.
Hand weights are important too.
I was expecting the same with this one.
Well, this one is a bit different.

I can say that I seem to be the only person that is dissapointed by this album.
Sorry...
I hate to say it but it is.
Don't get me wrong, I love Derek Trucks.
If I had to describe this album in one word, that word would be: soft.
I have yet to find it.
I think he is one of the best guitarists out right now, but this album doesn't really show his true talents.
There is not one song that really has that rockin, get up and dance feeling to it.
Where are the guitar solos???
I have to say this album is NOT one of his finest as most here will say.
For those of you who know and love Derek Trucks you know he plays a mean guitar.
Where is the energy???
How is the guitar on this most recent album you ask?
The songs are good if you want to listen to a good singer and a good backup band.
If your looking for sizzling guitar work, look elsewhere.

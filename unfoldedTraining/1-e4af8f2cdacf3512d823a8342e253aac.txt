Preppy.
We must destroy it before it takes over!
But do not buy this trash.
Not punk, not rock.
!
You are only fueling the mainstream pop monster!
Terrible.
It's that bad.
Do not buy this album!
Do yourself, and music, a favor and buy Nevermind by Nirvana, any Beatles album, or any Foo Fighters album.
There is only one thing an album like this is good for.
Awful.
Every single song sounds just like the one before it and is terrible.
Hey, these guys don't even deserve to be called pop.
Every single person that says this is the "greatest band ever" has obviously never heard Nirvana, The Beatles or the Foo Fighters.
FIRE STARTER!

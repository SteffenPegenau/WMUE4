How about a sequel "Fifteen Minutes Of Fame For Dummies!"
THANK YOU KARYN for that "expert" advice.
That may actually sell!
I give it two stars.
No wonder why the stores aren't displaying this book!
I had to search high and low for a copy.
She must have sold someone who was lacking intelligence to actually publish this book.
Where it should have STAYED!
"Save money by coloring your hair yourself."
BORING?
It was tucked away in the self-help section of the store.
One Star for the idea of making the website.
The second would go to Karyn's acting ability.
Being a fan of SaveKaryn.com I was excited to read her book!
I found her writing to be less than superior and her story was, oh what's the word...

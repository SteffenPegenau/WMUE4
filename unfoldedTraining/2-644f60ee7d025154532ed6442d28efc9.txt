I found this one laying around and it fit the parameters of a Book Challenge I was taking.
I can't understand why this author choose to have these people talk their feelings out loud?
It just made the characters seem ridiculous.
Wow!
The crime-solving plot was interesting.
The romance takes place over three days.
I didn't hate it, but I did finish it so I feel that it should be one and a half stars.
I used to devour Harlequin novels as a teen.
What really, really bothered me though was all the out loud internal monologue.
Um....wow.
The love story, though, was completely implausible.
A federal agent falls for the trophy wife he helped to put behind bars.
Two stars means okay, but it really wasn't okay.
Why couldn't she just write it in the prose?
It was twisty-turning, making you look at all the suspects and casting blame this way and then that way.

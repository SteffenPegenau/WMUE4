You don't even have to be an underground hip-hop fan to really appreciate this one.
Major street credibility can be awarded to this cat.
No doubt.
I would urge anyone to get this.
Finally, it hit the streets.
While most legit hip-hop fans enjoyed this album, millions missed out.
Just simply overlooked and left in the dust.
Solid flow, hot lyrics, and a true lyricist.
Nature's For All Seaons is a four and a half star project, and nothing short of it.First off, Nature is a truly gifted emcee.
There's no telling what this cat's doing these days, but the man is gifted with the art.This album was pushed back, and pushed back, etc.
Amazon.com really needs to incorporate the half a star rating tiers.
I don't care how corny you claim that sounds, step back and realize this dude is one of the game's best.
San Franciso backpackers, to West Virginia wigger hill billies will get something from this album.
Such a shame too.
One of the best hip-hop albums of 2000.

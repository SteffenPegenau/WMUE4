It's a shame it's very undrrated.
A fe of the other trcks had the same feel as well.
reminds me of madonna or britney spears.
a must have for any fan of pop music.
I wish i had this cd to listen to again!
Confide in me was a pretty kickbutt hiphop type song as well.
I really liked this song.
I was at first, hesitate because I read from alot of places that this is where her career took a nose dive.
This has to be one of her best albums.
But i gotta say this has to be one of her best cd's.
It's def.
Put yourself in my place is a great upbeat ballad, and Kylie can really sing well on this song.
I remember that zune recommnded this album to me a few years ago, and I loved it.
It def.
The video is pretty cool as well.

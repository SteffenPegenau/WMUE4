In fact, Bing includes some comments in the liner notes.
Trade Debbie Reynolds for Elizabeth Taylor, what was he thinking?
I wish they let you give 4 1/2 stars, four is too low.
The album is titled, "Debbie/Am I That Easy To Forget."
I love Debbie Reynolds, so I had to get this.
I'll always treasure you're performances, whether acting or singing.
This collection is a group of jazz oriented songs that would be performed in a casino or the like.
Although her biggest hit, "Tammy," is left off, her other hits are here, like "Aba Daba Honeymoon" and "Am I That Easy To Forget."
If you like jazz get this, if you like Debbie, get this period.
These would've worked very well for Frank Sinatra or Bing Crosby.
The songs on this recording were recorded in 1959 and 1960, when Debbie was getting over her divorce to Captain Dunce himself, Eddie Fisher.
Back to the album.
What am I thinking?
Well Debbie, no you are NOT!
I enjoyed "City Lights" very much as well.

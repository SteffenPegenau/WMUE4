It sucks!
The script is mediocre(full of cliches), the brothers don't look at all alike, the photography is poor or has been marred by the use of too much computer color filtering and contrast adjusting.
Even many Sy-Fy channel movies look better than this.
I agree with the professional movie critics.
There are much better war movies out there.
I will resell it.
I'm glad I got this dvd used(and cheap).
I do think this is an important story.
This is not a good movie.
We were both really really really bored.
My girlfriend and I didn't even watch it to the end.
I don't understand why Amazon critics like this.
We didn't bother to see the last 20 minutes of "Defiance's" tedium.
We turned it off to watch "The Big Bang Theory" on tv.
I just think this movie is a MAJOR DUD.

There, I've shot my wad and now I am gonna list the movie for sale for someone who can appreciate it more than me.
I mean the guys is a heel.
Bye.
The depth?
Where is the depth?
The complexity?
What happened to being faithfull.
It was so boring that I had it running while I did other things around the house (that was after I actually watched the first 80 minutes).
Ok, I know its Prague and 1968 and the whole Russian-thing, but come on - the historical backdrop was handled way too superficially.
I totally agree with the reviewer who said it was about two sad-looking people.
Where is the art?
Lewis is a fine actor, but the material is not the most exciting or throught-provoking.
I guess I just don't relate to guys who are constantly "bedding" every girl that walks past them.
I am sorry, but I just can't agree with the reviewers who praise this piece of work.
Sorry, it was lost on me.

Liza Minnelli plays a singer, Francine Evans.
Doyle picks her up at a party.
In the end, Doyle has the opportunity to leave with Evans in the mothership, but decides to stay on the ground.
WWII has ended.
After I watched it, I figured it was Scorsese's way of saying goodbye to his first wife.
Doyle can't, and doesn't really want to make the transition, but respects his ex-wife and her new boyfriend, since he can give her something he can't.
They start an act together.
They have a baby and their marriage starts to fall apart.
It's the execution that makes it great.I found this movie sticking out from a shelf in the library.
They fall in love.
Evans goes on to star in fancy Hollywood musicals.
Sometimes I have a hard time understanding what other people are going through.
That pretty much sums up all two and a half hours of this film.
Robert DeNiro plays a jazz musician, Jimmy Doyle.
I'm not sure if he heard me.
So, I said, "Thanks for sharing that with me."

then I noticed that the scenery is repetitive.
Trust me!
Please rent and do not buy...I'm telling you now or you'll really regret it.
I see a lot of great reviews for this game.
Maybe it's just me or maybe there is too much hype around this game.
And please don't compare it to Devil May Cry cause it is nowhere in it's league in graphics, gameplay or fighting mechanics.
Okay?
I for one can't find any reason to consider this game worth while.
I just bought this game and the first thing I noticed is the lame graphics!
Hell there isn't even a similarity except for the fact that they are exclusive for PS2.
This game really blows!
Let me tell you on it's merits alone in gameplay it's falls way short!
The only thing I found worth while about this game is the CG cuts and that's it!
It is so apprarent they just put this game together quickly slapped Shinobi on it and put it on the shelf to sell on name recognition alone.
Plus people say how shinobi looks cool????

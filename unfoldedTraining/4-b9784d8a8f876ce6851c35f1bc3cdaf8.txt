1st apply the liquid #1 and wait 3 min.
The color came off my skin and stayed on the hairs.
Just in case you wind up with some on your skin.
The color took well but I decided to do a 2nd application.
Then apply liquid #2.
Just like hair dye does.
It will come off in a day or 2.
This product worked great!
After 10 seconds or so, I washed it off.
If your skin takes the dye don't panic.
The only reason I did not give 5 stars is they don't tell you how long to leave on liquid #2.
I wanted to deepen the color of those hairs.
Take a cotton pad and put some of the color remover on it and give a good firm rub to each brow.
To play it safe, do this when you don't have any plans to go out.
My brows get lighter from the arch outwards.

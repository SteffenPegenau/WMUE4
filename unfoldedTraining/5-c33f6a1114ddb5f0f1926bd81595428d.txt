James Alteri, the author, was a ranger in World War II.
He was treated as something of a hero because he was one of the guys from the war.
He gives a really great first person account.
I wish that the book were readily available so that young soldiers could read it like I did.
I was a brand new lieutenant in the US Army.
I hope to one day visit Fort Benning and the ranger school and be one of the old guys (I will not be a hero like Alteri really was).
One last twist.
I think that you will like this little story of mine.
At the end of the book, Alteri describes visiting the ranger school that I was about to attend.
I read the book in 1969.
You cannot help but like this book!
It scarred the hell out of me, but it also solidified my resolve.
This is a really great book.
I had just finished airborne school and thought that I was pretty hot as a new airborne soldier (parachutist).
I was waiting to go to ranger school and read Spearheaders.
That is exactly the kind of book I like.

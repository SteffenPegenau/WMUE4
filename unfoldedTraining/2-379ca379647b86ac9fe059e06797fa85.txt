He says idiotic things like LOOK OUT or AHHHHH or even dont die on me Jak, I need someone to feed me.
The comic releif?
There is practicaly one boss, and jak can't jump.
COME ON LET ME FIGHT SOMETHING ELSE.
JEEZ WHAT THE CRAP IS THE POINT OF HIM.
If your looking at good adventure games, look at Rachet and Clank, Kingdom Hearts, and Harry Potter.
Try to stay away from this game, or be prepared to throw it against the wall.
Whats his point in the story?
What kinda game is this?
At first you see the amazing landscape, fun fights, and different contraptions.
And what the heck is with this idiot Daxter?
But no, its not that great.
NO WAY.
He tries, but cant.
There is almost no new enemies.
Hes almost as bad as the dude in kingdom hearts.
He cant do anything, just flies around like a weirdo.
I thought this would be an awsome game!
Then after a day.......... the game keeps repeating.

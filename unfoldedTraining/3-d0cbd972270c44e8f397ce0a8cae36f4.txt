What baddie foods can we do without?
That's my plan, anyway.
I love Vanilla, personally.
It rates 5 stars.I'd also add other items to the diet for some variety, but variety isn't that big of deal to me.
Do all the boring dietary stuff, but try to shift focus on to other activities you can enjoy that don't involve food.
Figure out how to cut the baddies you don't really need.
Eat less, exercise more.No, apart from training the mind/body/appetite to adjust to fewer calories, Slim fast doesn't teach you how to eat a proper diet, but we already know, don't we?
So Slim Fast works for me.What's the true secret to all these diets?
Drink lots of water.
Cut them out.
Dip into the baddie foods once a week; splurge.
That's all you grab from that aisle.
Which are indispensible?
Move on to the produce section.
I can live off a bag of potatoes and Louisiana Hot Sauce for a couple of weeks and a pot of beans and veggies.
Don't even pause in the aisle.

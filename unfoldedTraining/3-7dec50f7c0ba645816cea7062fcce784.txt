If you saw this film when it first came out, like I did, you'll be delighted that it's available.
Basil Rathbone can never do any wrong.
Ann Helm?
I am a fan of Gary Lockwood (2001:a space odyssey)and it is fun to see him back then.
Are there ruff edges?
This is a kids film.
The 1963 version of "The Thief of Bagdad" with Steve Reeves is the same kind of escape.
What's not to love?
I love this film for the escape.
Don't ever let your "kid" grow up!
If you didn't and you are expecting something from the "digital era" you may be very disappointed.
Sure.
I can always place myself somewhere in there (they both have 7 stages of strife) and it can actually help me figure out things at times.
So...enjoy it for what it is and you'll love it.
If you want to get a bit "heady" about these films, they are about struggle.

Maybe he was too little?
Seemed like they always had a little old food living in them.
Dunno.
But these are going in the trash.
Plus, stinker just didn't get into it.
These were so messy!
Bleh!
I couldn't really get them clean.
Not in the slightest.
It's kindda the deal, but I just didn't realize how big a mess it made.
I know, I know.
They just seem like a good place for germies to live.
Kindda like a old kitchen dish cloth.
Okay, anyone that comes to my house will quickly see, I'm not a neat freak.
He'd rather mash it into the floor than suck on it.

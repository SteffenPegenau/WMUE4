I have reciently discovered that Target.com sells them, and I'm going to go see if the store also has it.
If you don't mind purchesing the refills online, them this product is fantastic, and highly recommended!!!
!
Well here lies the problem!
Here comes the BUT... Now that I am nearing the end of the refill I need to buy more.
I have been to every Babies R Us, and every Toys R Us in the state of CT, and none of them have the refill in stock.
And even then it is only for a few seconds and it is only a hint of smell.
This is a fantastic product!
You can't buy them in any store.
Overall this product it fantastic!
I never smell anything unless I throw the diaper in it.
My son is 3 1/2 months old, and I'm still on the refill the machine came with.
My whole thing is that I REFUSE to pay shipping on an item that should be avaliable in the stores!!!
They say that they have been waiting months for them to come in!
I use it for my sons diapers, and as a trash can in his room.

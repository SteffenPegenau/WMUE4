I'm basing my review from that of a U.S.Citizen.
A close version is, but it is not exact.
Other than that the Stevie Wonder, Supremes, ABBA, and Rolling Stone Medleys are all here.
If you are looking for the Stars on Long Play Vol I Beatles Medley, that broke it into 2 parts on 2 seperate tracks.
If you are in from the U.S.
it too is an import but you can at least burn it on to your computer.
This has more American versions of what ew would hear on the Stars on Long Play Albums Vol I, II & III.
First off, this CD does NOT play on a computer.
If you are looking for the Original Stars on 45 Medley released in the U.S. in 1980, it is not here.
I recommend the 2 CD set, "Stars on 45 Greatest Hits."
So in other words, you can not burn this and use on an I-POD.
There are some add ons.
This is an Import as well.
Hard to find for sell sometimes but well worth buying.
I give this a 3 Star Rating because there are better Stars on 45 CD's out there.

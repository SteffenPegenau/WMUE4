If it doesn't have you singing along with it nothing will.
If not into foul language you might have a problem with track 2 and 3.
This CD also has a great intro.
It's message a blended in with a catchy tune.
There are a couple songs that I would not recommend.
Instead of plugging my ears, I actually want to hear what these songs are saying.
Wow!
The best song on this album is definitely "Lovely Day".
I know many of you like the really hardcore stuff, but to me this is less annoying.
But I can't talk about those songs because the good outshines the bad by far.
Lit did a better job the second time around.
I don't understand the title of the track but makes me want to party.
This is worth every cent.
So far I only found one bad word in these tracks, but like I said; the Good outshines the bad.
There is not one song that is so chaotic that is will annoy you.

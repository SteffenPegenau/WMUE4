There was no redeeming qualities for either of the two main characters!
I think Blaze would have been just fine with that.
I know I would have been fine with those two not getting together.
This book was so horrible it wasn't even funny.
Sick Obesession!!!!!
I think this book is more a study in obsession.
Not only did the writing/plot not make a lot of sense, constantly jumping around and such but the characters lacked even a smidgen of morals!!!
Can't see how anyone could ever say those two loved each other.

The H slept with the h's best friend who was a .... well I think you know and he didn't seem to give a care about all the abuse that the h went through at the hands of her so called "step brother"!
It was a tragedy.
Nope he just added to it.
It really would have been better if Trista had just disappeared never to be seen again.
.
How can you even label it a romance.
EVER!!!!!!

In the end how good?.
It's a skill.
Indirect or direct cooking.
Its pretty versatile any way you want to cook.
Five stars.
For long cooks or smokes the unit has to be tended.
The cleaning system works good.
I've had my kettle cooker for about 5 months now.
It is a all round great unit if you like to BBQ.
You have to like to BBQ for long cooks but that is OK a case of Bud ice cold works good for long cooks.
I like to sear steaks with coals about a inch from meat for one minute then move to side and cover till done.
I had one 25 years ago and sold at a garage sale for $20.00 because I went gas.
5 Gas grills later I went back to the kettle cooker.
You must love to BBQ.
Bought it here from Amazon.
This is a great BBQ cooker.

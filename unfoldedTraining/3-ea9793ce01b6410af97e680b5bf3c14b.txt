They like you today than dislike you tommorrow.
I wish them all the continued success they deserve.
Like there name strongly suggests, Live are at there best live!
Granted, this is not there strongest.
I'm originally from York Pa where Live is from and I remember when nobody knew them and they were great then.
It's by no means bad either.
It sounds like outtakes from The Distance to Here and that's all right.
Live is a survivor and a great 'alternative' to all the fluff out there.
Should a band that has five albums only be judged on their last album?
They are sincere in everything they do and deserve all the success they get.
Live is a band for the fans and not critics as should every rock band.
Is it any wonder that Live has survived this long while most alt rock bands have tanked?
Reveiwers are naturally cynical and fickle.
Of course not!
I saw them several times, and each time they rocked the house.

I have been to dozens of places in Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, and Vancouver and no soap - rather no staples.
It's works well but misfires A LOT.
I just shoot it again, sometimes 2 or 3 more times and it goes.
It's an annoyance but a small one.And the others are right.
A few upholsterers had them but not for sale.I'll keep it and use it, and even like it but Amazon better keep stock in staples.
You can't buy staples anywhere for it.
Yeah, I want to attach silk or brocade with oiled staples!
About 15% to 20% of the time it dry-fires and doesn't place a staple.
This is a pretty good stapler for light use but I would not use it in a production shop.
One fellow suggested I oil the staples before I put them in the gun.
I got them from Amazon but had to wait of course.
It's as if it shoots one but doesn't advance the stack.
You squeeze the trigger, it fires!
Also be aware - *THERE IS NO SAFETY* on this unit!
Staple length doesn't seem to matter.

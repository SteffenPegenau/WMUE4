They only have two original actors from the 2nd movie.
There are a lot of good ideas in the movie and they work well but it just doesn't feel the same.
There's things in this one that link it to the other two which makes the movie more interesting.
Don't get me wrong it's still a good attempt, but I didn't feel satisfied.
I know James Cameron didn't direct this movie, the style is not the same.
It's still a good movie.
Like Arnold and the main doctor from the psychiatric hospital.
I didn't really like the female robot, her acting wasn't that good.
It doesn't have the same feeling behind it like the first and second one did.
This dvd is action packed, with a good story and amazing special effects.
That's it!!!!!
!
It doesn't even have the same music like it had at the start of Terminator 1 and 2.
Arnold does it better.
I bought the movie without renting it, but I'm not disapointed.
GO BUY IT!!!!!!
BUT!!!!

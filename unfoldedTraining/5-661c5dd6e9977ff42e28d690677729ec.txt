You have my season 3 money.
So, when this series comes out, let's clear the shelves.
To the higher ups, the responsible parties, thank you.
Recession be damned, I will be buying it.
This comes as a big relief because I can now free up a whole lot of space on my DVR and do not have to buy tapes to record the episodes on two.
To my fellow Third Watch fans, get your money ready.
Thank you very much.
Sort of a thank you for the dvds.
To my fellow fans, see you in line.
So, here in America, we speak money.
That's how I can describe my reaction to this news.
I know that there are a whole lot of fans out there.
Overjoyed.
I'm sure that we can put some money in their pockets.
To Warner, know this, and I'm sure I speak for quite a few here, you have my season 2 money.
I already have season 4 on tape.
You have my money for every season that you put out.

It seemed short, the intro is misplaced.
Hope to find that female reptile whoever she is in the next games.
The character is no way cool for me.
I am looking forward to play GOW2 & GOW3 for the new story and hopefully some good twists in it.
Ok, so I finished the game.
What really annoys is the spoken English.
It is so rude it's not even cool!
I only saw the intro when I finished the game and googled to find out whether where the heck it was or was it even on the disc.
The controller took some time to learn.
I hope GOW 2 & 3 will do much better.
Again, developers tried way too hard to put someone out of the prison in the game.
I was surprised it took only 5 acts to finish the whole game.
The feeling this game gives: dark and someone said depressing.
I wished to see the person with female voice, no luck.
And it's repetitive.
Well it was more of a dark and lonely feeling that Earth is like that and mankind is almost extinct and those reptiles.

So I've returned the player to Phillips for warranty replacement.
I got the EXP503 to replace my bothersome MPTrip player.
Plenty of buffer storage.
So far so good.
The included car kit works as expected.Thanks Philips!
I ran 3 miles with it this morning with nary a skip.Bonus points for some rocking in-ear headphones that have some new BASS technology.
Rating dropped to 4 stars.Got the replacement model from Philips after a couple of weeks.
Currently awaiting the new one.
So far, I couldn't be happier.
A display that actually tells you the artist who plays that song #149 that you didn't know you liked so much.
Music cd's still play but the mp3 discs just sit there.
A resume feature that will pick up where you left off yesterday (caveat: batteries or power source must be connected for resume to function).
!Update in Feb. 2002: The MP3s stopped working.
Batteries are NOT included contrary to product description.
I'm using NiMH rechargeables.

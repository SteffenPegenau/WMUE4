They have a life that you don't know about.
They became that way.
I was able to relate to it on several levels.
--Deb Caletti, Honey, Baby, Sweetheart, page 301
Honey, Baby, Sweetheart is about the one thing everyone can, on some level, relate to--love.
No one is ever how you perceive them.
It started to slow down.
They have a past.
They had an adventure.
Life's an adventure.I did like the book.
Other than that, it was great.
"We are all a volume on the shelf of the Nine Mile Falls Library, a story unto ourselves, never possibly described with one word or even very accurately with thousands."
Elder people aren't just old.
They have secrets.
It is a good book.
Therefore, they were once young and experienced much of the same that we do today.
Love is important and effective, no matter how old or a young a person is.The message of the book is that everyone has a story.
There were times, though, when I felt as if the writing was lagging.

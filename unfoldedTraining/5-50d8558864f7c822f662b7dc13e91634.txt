I wish I could give this an even higher rating.
Clay seems to be a great & humble person.
From what I have read & seen about him he has great taste in music.
I really love you!!
I am sooo glad I bought Clay's single.
I do hope Clay can chose some songs to be on his debut CD.
But Clay Aiken is the whole package no matter what anyone says: he has the looks, the VOICE, and the fantastic personality!
I was surprised that I loved his sound so much to be honest, just because I have never been a big fan of most male singers.
WONDERFUL JOB CLAY!
Get it & you will not regret it!
She wants more Clay now just like I do.The songs are beautiful - just perfect!!
!
AND it made my mother a fan too when she heard it.
Clay has such a unique and lovely voice!
It made me an even bigger fan!
Those qualities just made me love him more!

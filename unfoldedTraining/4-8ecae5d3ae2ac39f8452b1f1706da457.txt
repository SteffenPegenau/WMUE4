However, the book lacks the visceral impact of the visuals in the miniseries.
My advice?
"Band of Brothers" is a very straightforward record drawn from personal accounts from the paratroopers of E Company and other sources.
They complement each other very well.
He shares these very candidly.
The book includes interesting background and personal detail not included in the miniseries.
No punches pulled here.
I especially appreciated the personal detail he extracted in face to face interviews.
A watching audience would view them as tedious.
This may be the first time I enjoyed the movie (the HBO miniseries) more than the book.
However, many will prefer the simplicity of Ambrose's "just the facts" approach.
Stephen Ambrose lacks the style and wit of Edmund Morris, the last author I read.
Rating: 4 of 5
The reader is treated to the feeling that he is more than acquainted with the soldiers of E Company.
Watch the miniseries AND read the book.

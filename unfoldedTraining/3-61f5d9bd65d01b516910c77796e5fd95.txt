That's all.
But that doesnt mean she's talented.
The songs are catchy and all, but it has no substance.
Nikki Cleary has a nice voice.
She can sing, yes.
Plus, the songs on this album are a little meaningless, like Summertime Guys and Sorry of Myself, even though the tunes are really catchy.What i dont understand is, if Nikki can sing - why does she lip sync?
I really wonder why people dont trash her like how they trash Ashlee Simpson.
She doesnt write her own songs and most of the songs on this album are cover versions.
It's just okay.
The mic wasnt anywhere near her mouth and she was singing.
Okay.
Really.Anyway, back to the album.
Because singing is the only thing she can do.
It's alright.
She BLATANTLY lip synced on Nickelodeon's "All That" which is a kiddy version of Saturday Night Live.

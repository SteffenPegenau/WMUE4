We use these for maintenance now.
Last week he managed to escape.
I took this bottle of tablets outside and started shaking it as we called for him.
Our cat loves these supplements.
Before our current residence, he was allowed outside.
After a battle with a nasty UTI, we have been healthy since.
Nothing to do with the fact that he used her bed to tell us all he was sick with his UTI.
He is no longer allowed outside.
He gave up his outdoor adventure for this treat.
He hears the bottle come out of the cabinet and flies in for his vitamin.
He loves the flavor.
She despises the cat so I'm sure it was intentional...
(We have a dog that can open doors when she wants to.
We could not find find him and he ignored our calling.
He spends hours in the window longing for outdoors.
Now we live near a heavy road and have coyotes, bobcats and owls.
LOL.)

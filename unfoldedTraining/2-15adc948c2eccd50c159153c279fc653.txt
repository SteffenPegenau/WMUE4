The basic idea that complexity can be obtained by very simple rules is not new.
It doesn't tell you how to replace current math, physics, etc.
And looking at lots (and I mean *lots*) of fractal-like, cellular automata, game of life like, black and white pictures is no fun at all.
This is not a "how to" book.
)I think the basic info in this book, the basic theme, could be written in under 100 pages.
For me, not many new ideas.
You need to understand the text to understand the pictures.
(A few pictures would be o.k., but hundreds is not good.
Glad I didn't buy the book.
with something new.
It only suggests that it might be possible to do so by considering "it all" as computation and by finding/defining simple computable systems.Some interesting ideas.
But if you understand the text, you don't really need the pictures.
(Borrowed a copy.)
The pictures tell you nothing.
The idea that the Universe, in all its complexity, may be a result of very simple (computational) rules is not new.

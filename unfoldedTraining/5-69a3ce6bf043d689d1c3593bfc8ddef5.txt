But totally BETTER!
I was buying more Anne Rice's books and saw Exit to Eden, I picked it up knowing if Anne Rice wrote it, it would be good.
I agree with people saying its the best.
It was completely different than the movie!
You must be open-minded.
I like the fact it went from The Club to real-life.
A MUST READ!
I have read most reviews.
But... it was even better!
I recommend this book with no problem.
For those who say it "trash," you may need to open your eyes and see the true world out there.
Read it!
I have read the Witching Hour and the books to follow for the series.
It's not the 50's anymore.
Never realized there was a book for it.
Amazing.
Anne Rice continues to amaze me with her works, specially considering this is a earlier written book!
Movie was okay, I liked it.
You have your opinions, but I have mine and this is an EXCELLENT BOOK TO READ.

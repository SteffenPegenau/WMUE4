I am buying a second one now.
I have written to Black and Decker through their web site several times.
I realize that nothing is perfect.
For $60 I don't expect RTX to be an Industrial tool.
I bought it more than 60 days ago so the retailer will not exchange it.
This time I am going with Dremel.
Lemon or no lemon, I am very dissatisfied with the customer service at Black and Decker.
Not having any information from the manufacturer is the worst part.
I have not heard anything from them.
I did however expected it to work longer than 15 minutes!
Total life of this unit was about 15 minutes.
The sixth time I went to use the tool, it seized and smoke came out of it!
After the 5th use, the speed controller failed.
It started to hiccup while working.
After the second use, the chuck lock failed and I had to use a small screw driver to unlock the chuck.
I realize, I may have a lemon.

I've watched it a handful of times.
The special effects are the most impressive aspect (The action isn't bad either.).
Liam Neeson's character is an example of this (The same goes for Darth Maul.).
This film has some good qualities to it.
Something else that should be better is the plot--it isn't too captivating.
Any movie that I can watch more than once isn't too bad.
All of the various creatures throughout the movie are interesting also.
One thing about The Phantom Menace that is disappointing is the lack of character development.
Worth a viewing.
It's not as good as the other films in the series though.
I don't consider The Phantom Menace to be boring.
There are some things that could be better.
The Phantom Menace is pretty good, but I don't find it to be a classic.
He doesn't irritate me at all.
As for Jar Jar Binks, I have no problem with him.

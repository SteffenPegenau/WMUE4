And that didn't help Instead it ends up bringing in these nasty flies.
From all the cleaning and everything.
Now I am shopping around for another one.
It cause it to crack on the top.
I have done everything from bleaching it.
Cause my son is going to potty training and I can't stand the smell no more.
when I had my first child.
i even let it sit outside in sun.
Its disgusting.
Not only do I have to change the pail every other day.
it stinks up my whole bathroom and bedroom.
This pail was given to me as a gift.
I am very dissappointed in the product and will not buy another one of these.
Soap.
White Vinegar.
Well he is 2 now and I have a baby girl who will be turning one next month and I have to say it is the most worse diaper pail in the world.
Scrubbing it.
Cause I live in sunny FL.
But it likes to hold in the smell.

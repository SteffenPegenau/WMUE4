It's not anything extraordinary, but it's a nice twist.
The movie is very sexy and the climax is pretty messy.
Give it a try.
Cherry Falls is another teen/school horror film.
The great Candy Clark plays her mother.
It's nothing new, but as far as the genre it's in, it's above average.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
It's not half bad.
She is a great heroine.
There's the twist.
She's real and believeable.
Brittany Murphy is a great actress.
Normally, the killers go after the ones who have sex.
Jay Mohr co-stars as a teacher.
This one, however, has a different take on the usual killer m.o.
Brittany Murphy stars as a small town girl who realizes that her sheriff father, played by the always solid Michael Biehn, has some dark secrets to a serial killer who's preying on virgins.
The killer's identity may be pretty visible for some people, might not be for others.
Unfortunatley, she has a small role and doesn't get much to do.

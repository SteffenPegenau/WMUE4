I have removed and reinserted the water container.
If I have issues with that one I'll just get my money back and wait until a new and improved unit comes out.
It's like it's dead.
Nothing.
Nothing happens.
I called their customer service number and he basically told me to do everything I've already tried.
Even after reading all the negative reviews, I decided to purchase the unit hoping I wouldn't have the same problems.
I've unplugged the unit and replugged it in.
Well I didn't have the same problem (at least I didn't find one similar to my own).
After the cycle finished I tried the unit with a coffee pod.
I prepped the unit as the directions described however my machine made a horrible noise.
So I guess I will be returning it today and will give it another try.
I have unlocked and relocked the pod unit.
I don't know what it was doing but it was making a buzzing noise that was really loud but continued to pour water into my mug.
When I press any of the buttons, nothing happens.

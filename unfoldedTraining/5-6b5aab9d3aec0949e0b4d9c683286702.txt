Would you like to wear your coat or carry it?
This book is a must have for any parent.
There's a reason teachers use Love and Logic in their classrooms - because it works.
They will feel more in control, they will be happier, and when it's time for something to happen that isn't a choice (time for bed!)
You will be a cool, calm, in charge parent who knows how to handle their kids.
Really you can just throw away all the other non love and logic parenting books you have.
More importantly, parenting will be what it's supposed to be: FUN!
This one does the job that well.
Would you like milk or water with lunch?
I promise you will see a difference in your child immediately!!
Try it!
Then buy the book, so you know how to handle any situation!
You can even try this one thing today, before you even buy the book - start giving your child choices (where you are fine with either choice).
Would you like to wear the blue shirt or the red shirt?
they will be more willing to cooperate with you.

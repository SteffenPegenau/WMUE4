Before writing this review, I read some of the others.
He is in your way ALL THE TIME.
There is no way around him.
Every move you make is determined by the camera angle.
If the people who designed the game are reading this......WHAT WERE YOU THINKING???
"I can probably get used to it, I bet this guy didn't even play it that much...." Wrong!
And buy the way, I couldn't figure out whose side Scooby Doo is on.
And finally, there are only three levels.
When being chased buy a villain, he practically pushes you into them.
I find that the game ranks somewhere in the middle.
I know what you're thinking.
Most of the time, when you want to move one way, you end up moving another.
I have two words for the developers of the game.....EXPANSION PAK
Most people either said that the game was excellent or very poor.
This is the most difficult 64 game to control that has been released.

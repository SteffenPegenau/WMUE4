The historical descriptions were OK but the rest was truly disappointing.
The romantic parts are truly shallow.
Not that I have anything against Daniel Steel, it just wasn't what I expected from "without doubt Ken Follet's masterpiece, and a story for all time" (from book backcover).
And over and over again.
The two stars rating (instead of one) is owing to the impressive architectual descriptions of the cathedral.
The plot repeats itself over and over again.
The sexual descriptions are at times almost vulgar.
Don't torment your readers with 1000 pages looking all the same.
It reminded me of a Daniel Steel novel.
Then the bad guys come up with a new plot to ruin the good ones .
The bad guys attempt to ruin the good guys.
The characters are all one dimensional.
The language is too much 20th century for a 12th century novel.
Besides, if you want to write this kind of novel, you can settle with 300 pages top.
The good guys prevail.

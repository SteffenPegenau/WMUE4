Same pain but not an option for a man.
Well, there is always this Christmas.
It has two major problems.
Last but NOT least...it's very loud.
So on his behalf here goes.
Not what you would expect for the money and less than a year old.
We have NEVER wrote a review but this shaver was so bad I wanted to hopefully save someone else some time and money & pain.
He could always wax.
Short and simple.
He is not new to electric shavers so yes he has tried to fix the problem.
Our daughter bought this Christmas of 2007.
For one, it yanks his hair out.
He closes the bathroom door, turns the shower on and it's still loud.
Not quite a year old.
He is not a person to complain or write reviews.

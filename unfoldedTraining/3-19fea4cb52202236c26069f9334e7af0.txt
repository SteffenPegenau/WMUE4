Hypnotoad.
The opening gag, with them taking a jab at the "Box" corporation, was hilarious, and there's a lot of fun bits about mucking with the space-time continuum... Mostly, though, this seemed pretty slack and padded-out.However, the real gold here is the bonus feature full-length episode of "Everybody Loves Hypnotoad" (from the third season).

I don't know why, but I LOVE that show!
Need to see more.
Hypnotoad........
Would love to see more.
It's nice to have the "Futurama" crew back, even if they did seem a little challenged by filling up all the space in a feature-length format.
Must see more Hypnotoad.

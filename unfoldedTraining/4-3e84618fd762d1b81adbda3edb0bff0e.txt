WOW!!!!!!!!!!!
But ends up going through a world of strange, terrifying creatures, strange nosies, the risk of her life and ends of finding out about the strage past of Silent Hill, and also her daughter.Now if you are in for a good terror movie.
Which was Silent Hill.
I would give it an A-.
Variaties of people try to stop her from going there.
But of course she doesn't listen.
SOmething that will make you jump, I do recommend this movie.
As she is driving, you see a police officer follow her.
So they get to Silent Hill and the mother doesn't pay attention to the road and crashes and gets knocked out.
Good.
Probably the scariest movie that came out this year so far.It is about a woman who adopts a little girl who keeps having dreams about the city she was born in.
Her mother takes her there and strangly, as there driving along.
Great movie.
Everyone should see it.
She goes into Silent Hill, hoping to get her daughter and leave.
When she wakes up, her daughter is gone.

3.5lb head.
I do find the X-27 better for me with the longer.handle.
I own two of your axes.
your line of axes are exactly what we need.
With the usual.
They both perform wonderful.
Thank you for your wonderful products
And plenty of split wood to keep us warm this winter.
Two safe sturdy handles.
The wooden handle is often a problem as well with cracks and splinters.
I have owned many axes in the past.
Two sharp edges.
Two very well secured cutting heads to the handles.
The cutting head is the perfect shape for rapid splitting through even the toughest Knotty red oak.
I have two great axes, with no problems.
The problem with them is that their blades are very skinny and long.
but all things considered.
The fiskars X-25 and X-27.
Which always causes the blade to get stuck in the log rather then actually split the log.

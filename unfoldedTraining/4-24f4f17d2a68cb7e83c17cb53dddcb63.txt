If you want the cuteness, but also want to be economical, collect or play with the My Scene.
However, I've learned you just can't beat the Bratz if you're wanting a pretty, collectible fashion doll.
I highly recommend this, for a child or a collector.
I've been collecting dolls for a while, and just began collecting Bratz this year.
Ouch.
They are a nice theme that no other company has come up with.
They will also be a hard one to mimic, if Mattel's My Scene's come out with one, it will be blatantly copying.
The Twiins are very nice.
Highly recommended.
They do not come with as much stuff, or quality stuff (i.e.
$35?
(as far as I know).
They are both much more beautiful than they look in the box.
you can't put stuff in the purses...) but still, they are a lovely fashion doll and are very durable.
I've decided this will be my last Bratz, though, because of the prices.

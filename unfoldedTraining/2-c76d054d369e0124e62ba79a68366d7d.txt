I filled it with water, thinking perhaps moisture might revive some rubber seal or something.
At the time, I thought it one of the best things I'd ever bought.
It was such a great idea.
A+ for imagination; F for execution.
I emailed the company and was told to clean out the filter at the bottom.

No change: the thing would simply not hold pressure.
But this wheel-pump.
Regretfully, I put it out along the road, and a passing motorist must've stopped and picked it up.
Living in a rural area, I have fencing, an unpaved driveway, and other areas that need to be sprayed.
Still no change.
When I first saw this advertised, I thought it would be great.
I found the filter, which looked fine, but I rinsed it anyway.
I'm a senior citizen, and the hand-pump sprayers just were too slow; I'd run out of energy.
I found I could hook it onto the back of my garden tractor and drive along, spraying as I went.
That changed the second season, however, when it refused to hold any pressure at all.

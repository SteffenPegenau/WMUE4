i will do it just to get it away from me!!
OMG, I cant believe i bought this!!!!!!
i paid 130 dollars and now i cant get more than 70 dollars for trading it in.
this system sucks!!!!!!!!!
this is why i hate nintendo had helds!!!
Stylus to hard to control!!!
let me talk about the flaws:1.
I feel like ive seen it before.2.
Take this to no offense but anyone who thinks this is better than psp they are too stupid to turn on the psp or are still in the nintendo phase.
!I could go on and on about this but i dont feel like it!!!
bad gameplay graphics and propaganda about inovative new features3.
game quality you would expect from nintendo.
pay the freakin' 100 extra dollars and get a system that is sleek, serfs the web, plays dvd's, save images and has itunes!!!!
!one really annoying thing was i got this with my Kwanzaa money.
it may slide across screen an ds wont respond!!!
i have 2 games; Mario kart and trauma center.
i am going to do that.

Never throw it.
It is a preatty comfortable controller.
If it gets wet it starts to smell funky.
Ok this controller is a good idea exept for these problems:1.
A couple are: Crazy Taxi, and Demo Discs.Thats all the bad things I have to say about it.
I used one of those battery testers so I know how much juice it has left and it was practicly full.
And a good idea.Oh one more thing.
I had to buy a new one.okPeace Out
So I guess you have to change the batteries more often.2.
Like Someone said before.
On the box and in the instructions it says you can throw it.
Dont.
It doesnt work for all games.
Which kinda sucks.3.
It has no rumble.
My cat chewed part of it up since its so soft.5.
You know from sweat.4.
If the batteries get old thenm it justs stops period.
You know it dont vibrate.

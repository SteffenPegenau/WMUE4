See the movie, laugh.
Then I saw it again...and again.
Now, I love it.
And add it to your collection.
Why did this movie do so well?
This is one of the ultimate 'chick flicks,' but men can get laughs out of it as well.
Nia Vardalos (Toulah) is beautiful and shines in this romantic comedy.
It's wonderful.
I do love this movie.
See it again, laugh.
John Corbett (Ian) is so sweet; makes me wish all men were like that.
We can all relate on some level.
The first time I saw it, I had mixed feelings.
Because there is something of everyone in it.
Dreams do come true, at least in this story.

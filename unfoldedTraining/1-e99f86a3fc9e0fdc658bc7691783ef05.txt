Once again Sony is lagging from making good products.
Their suggestion was to have a repair man come out and see what they can do.
Sony used to be top of the line buy but has fallen further down the line as they think the name can sell their products.
The stand by light blinks 9 times and the tv never turns on.
Yeah!!!
Buy that time, I can purchase a much better tv from Samsung or Panasonic and spend the same amount for a newer better tv and guaranteed to have it work!!!
The worst part is there is nothing we can do.
If you do any research this is a common issue Sony buyers have.
Thanks for nothing!
The part is no longer made.
Thanks again for nothing Sony!!
They lack quality.
Sony products are "has been."

My television lasted a little over four years and went out.

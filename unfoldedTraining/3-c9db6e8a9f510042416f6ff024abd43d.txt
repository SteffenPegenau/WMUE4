WHEN YOU WATCH A LOW BUDGET FILM MADE FOR AROUND 12,000 DOLLARS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET STAR WARS!
The soundtrack music was also quite good.
When I read the other reviewers comments, it is as if they felt it should look like a million dollar plus film to be good.
It is very easy to say YOU STINK!, and laugh at anthing made cheap.
It doesn't match the directors latter work in quality, [Fred Olen Ray], but the script was decent and watchable.
Now that I said that I found this low budget film entertaining.
But it has a real 70's feeling to it.
I saw it on TV around 1980 too.
It was fun and watchable like a 1950's style Sci-Fi.
It won't for that money.
Buster Crabbe gave a decent performance, and so did the rest of the cast who tried.
Granted their acting was a bit rough.
No ultra low budget film will look like Star Wars.
It has a good zombies VS us plot.
For the budget it was a good job.

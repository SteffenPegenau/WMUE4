CALL BACK TOMORROW AND SLAMMED THE PHONE DOWN.
NO LUCK, JVC SUCKS.
YESTERDAY I WAS ON HOLD FOR 45 MIN.
I CALLED JVC.
I HAVE READ AND REREAD THE INSTRUCTIONS.
WON'T YOU!
CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE 2ND BIGGEST CONSIDERATION YOU SHOULD TAKE ONCE YOU DECIDE TO BUY AN EXPENSIVE PRODUCT.
WITHOUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE HOW CAN WE GET OPERATION INFORMATION WHEN HELP IS NEEDED .
I GIVE 2 POINTS AS I CANNOT ACCESS MY VIDEO FOOTAGE TO COMMENT ON QUALITY.
THE PRINT ON THE CAMERA IS VERY DIFFICULT TO READ EVEN WITH GLASSES.
WHEN A FEMALE PICKS UP THE PHONE, SAYS, I THINK!
IT IS LIKE ALL OTHER CAMCORDERS.
THINK ABOUT IT!
THE CAMERA IS EASY TO RECORD.
I CAN NOT GET THE CAMERA TO REWIND OR PLAYBACK.
I TRIED FOR HOURS TODAY TO GET THROUGH, EVEN TO GET THROUGH TO AN OPERATOR.
I AM NO TECHNOPEASANT BY ANY MEANS.

To make it a kids movie.
In Jurassic Park John Hammond and Ian Malcolm die.
Why isn't he like that in the movie?
The characters are different, the animals are different, and they even added a part which wasn't in the book.
What are they doing alive again.
Remember: You won't have anything, until you have the book.
John Hammond is also a mean old man who swears a lot.
Even the way it is it still doesn't classify as a kids movie.
Yes, that is why the ending is so horrible, it was never in the book.
Watch the movie, enjoy it if you want.
But you won't get the full thrill, excitement, adventure, and emotions as the book will.
Recently I read the book.
Having watched the movie 3 times I quickly fell in love with the book.
No dinasours go to the main islands, and even if they did, why was it that the main island was some major city like LA or San Fransisco, I thought they were in Porta Rico?
The movie I cannot rate that well because it is nothing like the book.

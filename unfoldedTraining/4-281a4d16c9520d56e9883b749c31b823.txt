Keep 'em coming.
In fact this had shades of Batman Begins.
The voice acting was ok.
Very 'real world' much like Nolan's films.
DC has been on a role with these.
Now, besides Batman, maybe DC can get their live films up to par.
This movie could've been longer but that's fine.
This, and many other animated superhero films, specifically DC Comics, are not made at all for children.
That out the way, this was a dark and gritty Batman movie.
Hence the PG-13 rating.
Much respect there for the material.
I'm not the one to whine about where's Conroy.
Maybe.
I can see this story's influence on that film.
To clear up common misconceptions.
He, like Christopher Reeve, don't own the character though they did great jobs.
Maybe Man of Steel next year will make a run.
I also loved the tough Gordon character.

but his voice ruined one of the funniest books i've ever read.
i don't think this is good business.
so i'm stuck with this rather expensive disc i will never listen to.
on the other hand, it's very easy if you have the apparatus to repackage something to look brand new so i don't know if the seller did this prior to selling it to me.
i suppose it's a catch 22 situation.
as a gift, i couldn't send it to my friend.
i guess it has to happen sometime.
the seller thinks you'll just copy it and send it back.
this would be my first unhappy experience with amazon.
hoping to return it.
as a book to listen to while driving it would put you to sleep!!!
how would you know there was something wrong with it?
i've since discovered the seller will not accept its return because it's been opened.
why would you return something you hadn't opened?
i listened to about 10 minutes of it and it's a good thing i did.
i LOVE bill bryson.

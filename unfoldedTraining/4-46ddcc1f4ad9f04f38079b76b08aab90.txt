this movie was different.
he was great.
light entertainment with some good laughs.
and this broken home with two sisters.
lol.
not suprising for disney of course, disney is always great.
disturbed or something.
and he's really mean and disgusting and obscene.
the director took a different appraoch.
i was a little disturbed.
the little girl is sick, you know?
but it was funny.
ving rhames supporting the voice.
very instable.
i personally liked the social worker, "cobra bubbles" the best.
i put in this movie expecting the expected.
i mean its a story about this little ferocious monster that destroys everything he touches.

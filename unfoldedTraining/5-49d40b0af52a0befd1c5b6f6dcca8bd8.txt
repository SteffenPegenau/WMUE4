The end scene?
Especially, I love the brilliant music by Johan Söderqvis and the two fine young actors playing Eli and Oscar.
It could be.
Simply brilliant filmmaking.
Just have a great time watching it.
Always remember, what goes around comes around, but most importantly, as much as possible, or whenever possible: let the right ONE into your life.
It was a small US release in 2008, and not surprisingly it was overlooked by the Oscars Group.
It will hunt you, I might add only if you are open to non-conformist, exceptional and personal cinema.
Is it a horror film?
A love story?
I am not a big fan of vampire literature, but this story is so beautiful and the film is so well done that it will hunt you for a long time.
Definitely.
Thriller?
The cat scene?
"Let the right ONE in" is poetry on celluloid, it is one of those rare gems that comes along only once in a while.
It is a film full of surprises, enigma and metaphors.
Not really.

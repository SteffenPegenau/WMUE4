Nothing moves in this bra - not during jumping jacks, not running in place, not doing kickboxing.
My god!
Stop laughing!
I was in pain from things bouncing around and nearly gave myself a black eye during each class.
I am 44DD and take a cardio class with lots of running, jumping, and other boob-unfriendly activities.
Yes, it fits snug, so if you're used to the way your regular bra fits, then this will be a little different.
this is what I need.
I love this bra.
It's true.
I looked online for local retailers (sorry Amazon, my next one will come from you!)
I found info on this bra on some runner's forum and I think to myself huzzah!
To all you women out there with more than the average bust - listen to me.
I wore it today to my cardio class and came home with no pain in the bust!
the difference this bra makes.
and went to get one.
BUY THIS BRA - YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.

Etc etc!
She sleeps, hangs out...
It is a must have and I regret not having it for the first 7 weeks.
I thought the wrapping part would be daunting but there are multiple ways to wrap it and the baby loves it.
It's quite soothing.
Though I have yet to try.
It's amazing and I have my hands free!!
U can nurse in it...
We bought this when she was 6 weeks old and I regret waiting so long!
I also have the bjorn which I hate.
Perfect for a baby who wants to be held all of the time and affordable.. Washable...
It is incredibly comfortable for both of us.
Don't look any further... Get a moby!
I LOVE this carrier & so does my 2 month old.
U can wear your baby while giving them skin to skin contact.

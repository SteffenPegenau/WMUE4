This is the real deal here.
Most notably on the monster epic "Dream of Mirrors".
The songs have some of the best melodies you can imagine.
Hell, all the songs have incredible melodies, riffs, tempos, time changes, etc.
I really like this album, and listen to it quite frequently.
It is a close one with "Piece of Mind", but I think I prefer BNW.
The production on the bass and drums is really amazing, leaving a clear, pounding, feeling.
All you can expect from Maiden surely turning out better than you thought.
The production of the album entirely is really good.
After it growing on me, I believe this album is my favorite Iron Maiden album behind the 2 Paul Di'anno cds.
This is Brave New World.
It's not one of those-listen to once throw away albums.
There's not much to be said about this cd that hasn't already been that.
and it did.
On my first listen I was thinking "I hope this grows on me!"
The line-up changes and reunition, etc.One first listen, the songs may not strike you.

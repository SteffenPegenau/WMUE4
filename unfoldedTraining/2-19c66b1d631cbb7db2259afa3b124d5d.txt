My guess is that even the choirs are sampled this time out.
There's a few songs on this album and some good moments on that album but it never all came together for them.
Okay, they're cheesy, over the top, Spinal Tappy and all around silly.
MOW fell in love with technology and lost their way.
The "orchestration" is really just samples.
Every other song is bogged down with some lame pitch deepend narration.
There's an honesty.
The problem with MOW is that they have no definitive album.
Again, some good moments, but not nearly enough to sustain interest.
They still remain pompous and silly however.
The lyrics are worthy of Ed Wood but ya know, there's something appealing about them.
And when they're on, they rock pretty damn hard.
I think that's what they were trying to do here.
What a disaster.
But they have some good songs and can play it an inimitable sloppy, fast, over the edge sort of way.

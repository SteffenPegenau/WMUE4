The love story is old fashion & sweet & deeply moving.
My over 60 year old Mother, who is also a Grandmother read all the books in the Twilight series.
Twilight, however is the best one!
I finally gave in, but thought I'd read Twilight for a few pages to say I did try it, but once I began reading I was hooked on this story.
Even though I am in my 30's, I hate cursing and over the top sex scenes in books.
Vampires?
Teenagers in love?
I also don't like Vampire books, as a general rule....but give this a try.
I am a Mom in my thirties and would rank these books as my all time favorites.
It is one of the best love stories of forbidden love around.
Once I finished Twilight I wanted more of Edward and Bella's story.
My daughters are still little, but if they were about 14 I'd feel safe having them read these books.
It is that good!
All the books are great in this series.
She loved them so much , she kept bugging me to read them.
No thank you, I said.

I was told to trim the hair from her neck around her voice box to make sure the contacts could touch her skin.
When she starts barking I just squirt her and say no and she stops.
For some reason the collar never activated.
The little red light never came on or started to flash.
Invest in a $1 squirt bottle you can put water in.
So I trimmed her hair put the collar on and made sure the contacts were on her skin.
I put the collar on her, she heard something and started barking - NONSTOP.
That's what I've done and it's helped.
It has been a total waste of money.
So I decided to order a Innotek No-Bark Collar BC-50B.
She heard something started barking and once again it never activated.
So I tested it to make sure it was working and it was.
I swear I think she barked more with it on.
I have a Border Collie that barks at everything.
Wish there was a rating lower than 1 star.
Then I called Innotek's Customer Service to talk to them about the problem.

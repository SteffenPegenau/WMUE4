Sure am glad I didn't buy this cd!
This cd just should not have happened.
Oh well lets see uh, Petals, Northern Star and Playing your song are good songs.
The rest are bad.
Whew, that was close.
Except for "Awful".
Anymore.
Ever.
That song was grotesque and painful to hear.
It is, ironically enough, an awful song.
So really the songs weren't all that bad, but i'm not really into pop rock.
I would have liked this cd like two years ago.
Malibu and Celebrity Skin are mediocre.
I wish I had never encountered that song.
It's just so ugly!
I have strong personal feelings about it.
What was Hole thinking?
Oh my God!
They just made all these great albums and then went and made Cebrity skin.

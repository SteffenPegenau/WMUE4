Carrey is just MARVELOUS as the Riddler!
Carrey's only fault is that he hams his part up a bit.
Good directing by newcomer Shulmaker(far better than Batman and Robin!).
He dosen't have to be very evil(has the Riddler ever been very evil?
This guy had good iedas.
Kilmer's Batman is close, but no cigar.
Overall, a good movie, and perhaps the only Batman movie that the family can watch together(well, maybe Batman and Robin, too) Overall,a good movie!
), so it's easy for Carrey to portray the Riddler.
Unlike Batman and Robin, you can sit through it and not get bored!
Chris O'donnell is pretty good a Robin, htough his Dick Grayson is pathetic at times.
Batman Forever is a good film.
If he was, I'd probably give this movie two stars.
But his Wayne is pretty restrained.
Val kilmer plays Bruce Wayne pretty good.
Not a great.
The villans are pretty weak, not evil like Nicolson's Joker.
Jones hames up his role a bit too much fr me to take, but he isen't the center of the film.

Besides The Concretes, there are not many new exciting bands coming from Sweden.
"Cut The Rope" is reminiscent of The Libertines.
They combine punk rock and a familiarity with Britpop.
They worked on this album with Richard Rainey, who worked with U2 recently.
I know that they are popular with the ladies.
"You Can't Steal My Love" sounds like a remake of "Don't Look Back At The Sun" by The Libertines.
Mando Diao is a band capable of great things on their own.
Mando Diao may be a band to check out live, I get the feeling.
They are due for a great album soon.
Even the band Jet are fans.
Hopefully the chorus goes into a different direction.
There is a mod vibe on "God Knows."
"Clean Town" is much like early English punk rock music.
I wonder why they are compared to The Libertines so much.
This is the latest thing from Sweden.

I have read the book.
I could not put it down till I was finished.
Seems kinda dumb that most of the people that have left bad feedback have never even read the book!
It is incredible of some of the thing's that happened over there!
Remember this is a free country, and we are entitled to an opinion!
TRY TO HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND LEAVE POLITICS OUT OF IT AND DECIDE FOR YOURSELF!
Just read the book.
THANK YOU TO ALL OUR VETERANS!
If they are not then Mr. Kerry should open his records so we can decide for ourselves!
This book makes for some great reading!
I believe that the accounts that are given are true.
I have to believe it because Mr. Kerry will not sign the paper to release his records!
This book has changed my vote this election year!I do agree that Amazon has really made a mistake and has not been fair to some other books that you could not leave a feedback!
I will also boycott Amazon!
Amazon, you should be ashamed!

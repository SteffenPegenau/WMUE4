To start off with, this is a great music CD!
But I can't be sure of that.
As soon as I found out about this release I just had to get it.
And I have also heard that in March there will be another US released verison CD coming out.
All in all this a great CD!
A must have!!!
Like Out of Orbit, Invoke, Meteor, and the Otakon Concert version of Heart of Sword.
!
If you are just now getting intoJ-Pop this is a great CD to start off with.
There is nothing dissapointing about it (well except that you only get theroma-ji lyrics).
You won't have to skip any of his songs because they are all good!
And on Tofu Records website you can get a DVD(T.M.
Revolution Sonic Warp) featuring music videos of some of the songs on this CD.
If you have watched Gundam Seed or Rurouni Kenshin then you alseady know his style of music(which is how I got started into his music).
But you can only get at Tofu Records website.

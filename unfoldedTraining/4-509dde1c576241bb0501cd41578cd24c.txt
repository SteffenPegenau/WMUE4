You have to mail the device back to Garmin for replacement.2.
The battery cannot be change or purchase additional battery, because the battery is build in.
The Garmin iQue 3600 PDA is an excellent product.
I recommend the 1 GB.
Make sure you take the car travel kit w/u.3.
It does not always give the shortest route.
It takes a little time to learn the function of the device.
Once you learn it, then its a cake walk.Pro: 1.
It can load 3/4 of the U.S. on it.2.
It have all the function of a PDA and more.Con: 1.
Expandable slot for additional memory.
But it give the most common route.It is worth the $$$$.
The device is compact and easy to travel with it.
Battery life is too short when using the GPS.
Happy Travel.

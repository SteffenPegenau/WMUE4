The girl sits down, cracks the knuckles, and plays the piano.
True.
Point being, soul doesn't equal off the range high notes.
In middle school.
Etta James chewed gravel.
Listening closely, she plays the piano about as well as my two brothers did.
She sings pretty.
See Patti LaBelle.
Complexity is not the word that rushes to mind.I'm not as hard on her as some of the others though.
Problem is, just because someone can sit down, crack knuckles and bang on the ivory doesn't make them a musical revelation.
Her voice is good.
Especially on Fallin', Why Do I Feel So Sad, and the bonus track.Aside from the basic piano, and the ok singing, this album lacks.
Not great, but who cares?
Alicia takes her time.
Irma Thomas has the voice next door.
Patti LaBelle singing the National Anthem is like putting my manhood in a vice.

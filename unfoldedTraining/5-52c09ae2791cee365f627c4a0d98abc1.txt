The first keyboard I received did not function properly.
After reading the raving reviews about this media keyboard, I was distraught when the original keyboard did not perform.
My hat is off to Pinecone.
Pictures, music, documents with the touch of just one button.
The zoom feature is nice for that small legal print.
Pinecone has made everything right, and for that they get 5+ stars!
You will not be disappointed making this purchase, and you'll be purchasing from a company who backs what they sell.
A very happy customer!
Alex contacted me and offered to test out another to ensure it worked, and he shipped it out immediately along with a pre-paid return label for the defective keyboard.
Thanks again Alex.
The keys are fluid and soft to the touch.
Thank you Alex!
I just received the keyboard and it is magnificent!!
Messanger is a one touch feature also.
If you have media center, don't hesitate to make this purchase.

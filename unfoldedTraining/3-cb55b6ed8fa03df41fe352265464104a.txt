You know what is going to happen before you read.
Then get ready to say "What the hell????"
at the end.
Like the writing and characters.
I like surprises but there has to be some hint in the book before the ending.
Get it from the library.
It really makes no sense.So I can't recommend buying this one.
I was ok with that, it still made for a good read.Then he blew it.
I have read all the series.
With this one, there is no inkling of who the actual killer is.
(Don't worry I won' t reveal it).
It just drops out of the air.
Then it got too predictable.
The Attorny had me for a while.
He gave us an ending that was too much to believe.
Enjoy an easy read.
Do what I did.

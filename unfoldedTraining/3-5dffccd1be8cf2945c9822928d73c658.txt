So the 3-stars is for this DVD package.
The feature movie was great!
And the rest of the extras, while informative and even clever, was not so entertaining.
Ever since my nephews and nieces got it, they watch it twice a day!
I would too if I could!
It should win.
Trying too hard to squeeze a few more bucks from the audience!
Hopes it wins an Oscar!
They can now recite the lines along with the characters.
But if you wanna know if you should get the movie (single pack/disc)?
Frankly, the secrets of the Furious Five should just have been a DVD extra not packaged like we were getting another feature film.
I agree with all the other reviewers who said that this two-pack deal was not value for money.
The only other contender for best animation would be Wall.E
Yes!
Perhaps the main feature set the standard too high.
5 stars for King Fu Panda.

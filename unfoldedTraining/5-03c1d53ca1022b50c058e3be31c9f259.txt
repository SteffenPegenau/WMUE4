So much power in this music.
I was drawn back again and again because of simple curiousity.
So much energy.
So much fun to listen to.
Unbelievable.
And a nice selection of songs with incredible vocals.
Those critics,in my opinion, are dead wrong.
D*MN the critics.
These 'creations' are well crafted and colorful.
Vocals, at least this time, DO add to the blue man group.
You're darn right i am!
This is truly a great follow-up album from a group i will now stay true to with their every release.
Their 're-do' of DONNA SUMMERS' "I feel love" was juiced up so strong that it actually overshadowed the original.
I grabbed it, crossed my fingers, and placed it in my cd player.
This is an album i passed up because of the 'professional' reviewers trashed it more often than not.

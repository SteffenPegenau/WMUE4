Susie dies from a firework accident.
After awhile, she turns into a ghost.
It helped me learn this lesson and it can help you too.
I loved it!
I was jumping out of my seat at all of the surprises there were.
I had a great time reading it.This book also taught me an important lesson.
Gloria's the only one that can see her because she's little.
In the story, Charlotte was trying to help a friend find her parents and they developed a great friendship.
Then about 50 years later, a girl moves into the house.
The Ghost Sitter, by Peni R. Griffin, is abouta girl named Susie Miller.
She explained everything perfectly!
The author didn't need to do anything better.
Can she help Susie find her parents?I like that it is a mix of realistic fiction and fantasy.
She promises her sister, Gloria, she will never leave the house.
It is you can help people at all times.

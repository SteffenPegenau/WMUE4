very loud motor.
Brand: Unkown.
fps could be better.
shoots 54.6 feet.
When you get this gun in the mail it looks better than the pictures.
Its all plastic and only fully automatic.
Great gun for $41.95
ON the box it says 18.2 yds.
Mag can hold 500 rounds though.
Short sling.
The one problem I have with it is that sometimes you have to shake the gun to get BB's to shoot out.
Comes with 2 mounts one for flashlight and another for scope.
It is a good gun for begginners and backyard wars.
Its gravity fed too through the removable mag.
The shipping and Packaging could be better but the gun is very good.
It seems bigger to.
It is only 180 fps.
The seller says it is a WELL but it doesnt say that anywhere on the box.

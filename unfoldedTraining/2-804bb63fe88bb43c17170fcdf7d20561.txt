The timing and the passion never seemed to click.
And to describe some of the scenes to my friends, you would think it was a hilarious movie.
He seemed more mean that funny.
Maybe having Downey Jr. as the straight guy was the problem.
Two popular actors cashing a check.
There were a few funny moments, but in all it was a rather dull ride.
This movie and the actors never really did that.
Mean can be funny if given proper attention - Dr.
So I'm pretty sure the writing was good, but the execution was off.
Comedy is surely one of the hardest forms of acting to capture on film - you really have to commit to the character and the scene.
That's all.
What a shame.
Downey's vulnerable side seemed fake so you never really cared about the character.
I really wanted to like this movie.
Evil is quite funny, but he was vulnerable too.
I really like both of the actors in this movie.
The acting seemed to me to be "mailed in".

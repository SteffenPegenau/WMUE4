The cover and the booklet do not bother to mention whether it is an AAD or ADD disc.
This is a digitally re-mastered disc of a very old recording.
For five stars?
It is clean, no noise, what so ever.
Another surprise is that Karajan even let all the singers "to sing!"
Just listening to these singers in their top form is really worth it.
Surprisingly, the sound quality is quite good (I mean, much better than expected).
Some even filled the sixth major role (Dr. Bartoro) with someone also a star.
Besides, I don't know how else to rate it.
However, very seldom you can find a recording that assembles a group of singers like this one.
1950.
How old?
It is surely an all-star cast recording, with each of the five principals perfectly fitting his or her role.
There are other Figaro recordings consist all stars in the casting.
Sure.

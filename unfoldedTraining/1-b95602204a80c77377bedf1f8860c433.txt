Pip if a fool that got dumped too many times and where's the sex.
Just think of all the trees cut down to make all the additions of this classicly boring novel.
Okay, not really.
That's a little extreme.
It brings some humanity to them .
But, at least take this garbage out of school curriculums.
Was Dickens scared of it.
Don't kid yourself.
Its' making us stupid, making us believe Pip's world is what the world really is.
I hate this novel with a passion so great it scares even me.
I believe that all great novels should have sex in them.
This ranks with Catch-22 and Huckleberry Fin as one of the worst novels yet published in the English language.
Was there a plot?
I'd like to see all copies burned.
No.
Great Expectations is a fantasy on level with the Bible but worse, tragicly worse.
The fool author made it up as he went along not caring if it made sense or if the characters had any meaning.

Here are the reasons why:1.
Battery life is not impressive.
Maybe it is a tradeoff due to its relative cheap price.3.
Lousy installation software.
It is always stuck in the middle of installation (on Windows XP).
Should come with a MP3 player by default.4.
Enough memory for my records.
Small LCD screen.
This is irritating.
Same story for uninstallation.
Ctrl-Alt-Del to kill it.
Fast CPU for typical tasks3.
Wonder if Palm ever has software QA department since it is such a dumb problem.2.
In case it dies, the whole unit needs to be thrown away.But it does have some good points:1.
I got this unit free during some promotion and I feel lucky I did not spend a penny on this model.
Sharp LCD display at reasonable resolution2.

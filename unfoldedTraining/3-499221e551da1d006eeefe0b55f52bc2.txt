"I Go Wild", "You Got Me Rocking" are the best.
The rockers are all pure Stones gold.
Some are two and a half minutes long.
By far.
This is a very funky song with a great catch, both melody wise and chorus wise.
The Stones would miss with their next release, "Bridges To Babylon".
Instantly listenable.
Every track is either really good or pretty good.
The only real down side is that there's a few songs on here that are fairly short.
Oh well.
The first track "Love Is Strong" is one of the better, and most strongest, songs they've released in a while.
This is so much better.
This 1994 album is a very solid and entertaining release from the great Stones.
Nice job guys!.
Then there's "Suck On The Jugular".
It's a good album to pop in.
"Out Of Tears" might seem like too much of a Michael Bolton ballad, but it's nice and Mick sings it very nicely.

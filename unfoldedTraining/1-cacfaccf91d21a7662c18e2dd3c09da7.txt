but i strongly recommend that anyone predisposed to depression stay away.
i don't know.
unbelievable.
i lost my appetite.
i had no patience for anything.
its interesting to be sure.
i definitely don't understand it.
i thought it was the best stuff i've heard in years.
do not purchase this album.
i even started to write an adoring review.
i even stopped taking phone calls.
it may seem hard to believe, but something about this album is terribly dangerous.
i stopped bathing.
maybe someone someday will discover that it works subliminally as a depressant.
but then i found that upon repeated listenings the album has a remarkable effect.
i was so impressed with this album at first.
i noticed that my stomach became knotted.

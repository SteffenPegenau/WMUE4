The menu is intuitive and very easy to use.
I'm always using my digital camera but because it's so big and bulky (plus who wants to drag around a digicam when you're in a poolhall or bar?)
I could careless about the bells and whistles.
But I must confess this time around I wanted a camera in my phone.
The speakerphone is clear and web browsing just as good.
The rest of the phone is great.
Overall a very well balanced phone.
But whenever I need a camera I can always count on my phone being there w/ me.
Although navigation can be kind of tricky at times.
The camera works great but obviously it can't compare to my 4MP digicam.
After doing my homework I settled on the 8200 and wow was I ever impressed!
Custom ringtones, screensavers, games?
I rarely have it with me.
I remember when phones were just phones.
I was looking for phone w/ good functionality.
Who cares!
I highly recommend this!

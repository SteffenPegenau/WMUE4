Get something like Freedumb (see my review by Aaron) or another one.
This is probably their worst one.
But it isn't.
And Mike's voice!
Oh well.
I hate it!
I'm really sad and sory to rate this album 2 stars because I am a big ST fan.
Nobody Hears.
I'm am really sorry to say that I want my money back but I can't get it.
I thought this would be a great album.
The music on this CD is strange and isn't like ST Punk Rock.
That's their best song on here.
Just disappointing.....
If you are looking for Mike's original voice and their punk rock and all of that hard stuff and not this girly voice with mellow music, don't buy this!
It has like one good song.

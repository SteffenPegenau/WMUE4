Sea of Sorrow15.
We Die Young
No Excuses5.
Heaven Beside You6.
For some reason "Down in a Hole" was left off and they included the unplugged version of "Nutshell".
They include almost of their hits on these two hits but they are no way "Essential".
Get Born Again8.
What the Hell Have I?9.
They also left off Bleed the Freak.But for the most part this is a great hits cd but it could've been condensed down to one disc easily.Mine would have been:1.
Down in a Hole (studio version)12.
Again7.
Bleed the Freak16.
Them Bones13.
Man in the Box4.
Nutshell (studio version)11.
Angry Chair14.
I Stay Away10.
Rooster3.
Would?2.
Every compilation of AIC's includes only the unplugged version, I dont understand why, the studio version is much better.

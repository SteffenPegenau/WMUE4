Now all I'm waiting for is Kimberley Locke and Joshua Gracin to release their CD.
Some upbeat and some slow.
Came across this while looking for NOW 15.
So on that note, buy RJ's CD, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
The song choices were all wrong and he wasn't being publicized properly.
Justin's CD, I think, was too mature of a style for him.
Overall, I would recommend this CD.
Anyway, after listening to RJ Helton's CD, I have to say that I am surprised.
I do believe that this CD is much better than Justin Guarini's.
Since there was no publicity for this CD, I am sure you won't see it at the top of the charts which is too bad.
Even the American Juniors CD.
Both their singles are terrific.
It's a good first effort and hopefully he can continue.
Since I am a big American idols Fan, I do have all the CD's that's been released so far.
I was actually impressed with his vocals and song choices.

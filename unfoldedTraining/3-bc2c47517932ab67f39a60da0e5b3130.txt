The originality of the story is another question mark.
Why should she ?
But the writing does not slack off.
Gaiman leads the readers to a web of a young girl's journey, full of curiosity and agony as she "does her job."
It was Neil Gaiman, yes, but ground breaking and exciting it is not.
This trade paperback of a cute little girl who is Death is quite amusing.
I think a gamble on this is ok.
The writing is very sharp.
The art is at times sloppy and lazy, in my opinion.
I dislike this type of almost all black-and-white treatment of a comic book.
Gaiman is a veteran to telling stories of the non mainstream characters.
The art, needless to say, is average at best.
I thought it wasn't anything new.
But don't gamble on this book with your last dollar.
Is Death so threatening?

I paid a little more for this than other similar Netgear or Linksys product.
I bought the AirPort Express a couple years ago.
It is portable.
Then a few months ago, I bought a Canon MFP600 all-in-one printer.
It is beautifully design.
But this unit takes up less room and had a built-in USB port for printer.
First I set it up with the printer connected to my PowerBook.
Then I unplugged the printer, and connected it to the AirPort Express, immediately I was able to find the printer through the wireless network.
I plugged in a set of speakers to the AirPort just to try it out.
I used it for a long time only as a wireless router because my old HP printer didn't have USB connection and it refused to die.
Effortlessly!
I will buy it again if I need to upgrade in the future.
Change a few setting in iTune, and I got music from another room.
Everything worked the first time.
It was so easy!

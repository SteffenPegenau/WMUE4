I will agree that there is a certain clarity and presence to the midrange, but stop there.
It's as if they took the same cheap transducers and made them into an earplug.
I returned these.
These do not deliver bass as the recording intended, they deliver no bass.
I had reasonably high expectations for this product, based on a few online reviews.
In fact, they sound disembodied and thin.
I am totally disappointed at this product.
These could be classified as "gutless".
These sound like $9.00 ear buds with a rubber surround.
They do kill about 15db, but nothing like the claim.
or Sennheiser 280HD for far superior performance at a similar price.
There is *nothing* resembling bass here.
I recommend Bose "over the ear" headphones (really!)
Again, the ER6i are a good set of $12.00 headphones for $74.00.
The claims of eliminating outside noise are greatly exaggerated as well.

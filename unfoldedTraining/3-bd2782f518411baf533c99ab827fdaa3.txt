Here, I could see any number of B film queens from the 70's in the role.
Saw it in the theater and rented it later.
Give me more Wolverine (X-Men Movies).
Fast moving.
I liked the movie.
Kate Beckensale?
Still, the film was, overall, entertaining and exciting.
Almost too fast.
Speaking of the end...could it have been any more ridiculously sappy?
The characters weren't developed enough.
Hugh Jackman?
I'm sure in the right film she's lovely.
Happy viewing!
It was very exciting.
Please.
The film didn't give enough background on the characters for the viewer to give a rat's behind about what happened to them.
Couldn't wait for her to get it in the end...and we knew she would, even though after the extreme beatings she took, we saw nary a bruise on her.
Always happy to sit and drool.

Could sit and listen to them forever and forever.
What harmony!
Laura on the bass.
These girls are all truly truly talented.
You definitely won't nor could you possibly be disappointed with any song on the cd.
That accordion is haunting.
Chris and that fiddle can take you somewhere if you close your eyes.
And best of all, you know they enjoy making this music for us.
Their sound is so unique.
First time I heard these girls, I was totally blown away.
And Carol with that clawhammer banjo and that voice of hers!
Such sonwriting!
I have an autographed 8 X 10 picture of them hanging in a place of honor.
Wow.
And they are super human beings.
I have just about worn out this CD.

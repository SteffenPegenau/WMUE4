Weird.
If you have not been exposed to Bizarro fiction before, you should begin with one of the Bizarro Starter Kits.
Sick.
Please at least re-read before publishing.
Gory.
Weirder.You don't need to know more than the Amazon description tells you for you to learn what the book is about.
Intelligent concept.
If you survive that, then consider this one.Duza's writing skills need sharpened, but the story made up for some of it.
I answered myself "probably none".
As I read this I wondered how of my friends would want to be associated with me if they knew I had read this book (and pretty much liked it).
Sickening.
Funny.
Inventive.
And now I'm going to make it public.Unique.
The illustrations by Mellick captured the descriptions and added to the pleasure.Though this book was better edited than some I have read in this genre, there were too many blips left.
Thank you.
The lack of respect for the reader is annoying.
Vile.
Exciting.

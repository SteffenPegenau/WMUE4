To tell the truth, I don't own the CD.
I can't tell you not to buy the CD, and I shouldn't.
Personally, I'm getting pretty tired of that song "Oops!...I did it again".
I'll end this review with one more thought of mine.
And... what's UP with that music video I saw on TV?
Is this even qualified to BE a song?
I didn't want it because it would be a waste when I only like ONE song of the whole album.
But if I were you, I'd buy the single.
Britney Spears's CD isn't all that, like I've heard.
I put three stars because it's not a terrible CD, it's just.... annoying.
So..
I bought a single, and I'm happy with that.
It's disgusting, trying to make it look like she's "Not that innocent," when all along she's supposed to be this innocent lil' school girl.
Every time you turn on a radio you hear that annoying sound.
What kind of a song is this?

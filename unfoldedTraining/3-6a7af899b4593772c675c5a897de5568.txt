So at best this is a good fictional story.
Sure this movie is good.
There is too many things that point to John's innocence!!
And it's a punk rock romeo and juliet movie.
Actually if You were to ask Me, I would have to agree "Nancy killed Nancy"!
I must admit when I was young and naive, I too liked the movie, Sid and Nancy.
All in all it's a good fictional story, As I mentioned.
Alex Cox isn't by far My favorite person.
And now on every story I got to know the truth!!
This review was written in favor towards John Lydon.
But, I have grown into an adult.
And I really don't feel He did much investigating at all, On the truth.
Only because it's what most people have taken for the truth.
I don't believe Sid killed Nancy.
If You are interested in the truth, Try the movie "Who killed Nancy"!!

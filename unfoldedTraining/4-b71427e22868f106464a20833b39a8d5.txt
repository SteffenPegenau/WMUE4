What was Gotham supposed to be, Las Vegas?
The childish dialouge?
The villians' insane, forever lasting laughter?
This was an above average movie, but could have easily been the best of the Batman series.
Two: TWO-FACE'S CHARACTER.
One: NIPPLES ON THE BATSUIT.
This movie should have been the best yet Batman but instead slides in at #3.
Note the word "goth" in Gotham.
And what was with those 1940's cars and music?
It's just too colorful, which leads me to three: TWO MUCH ... COLOR.
They should have used the black and white suit from the cartoon instead of a red and white zebra suit, with an leopard tie and spiked shoes.
I have a few problems with this movie.
What the ... was that there for?
But compared to the next Batman this one is "The Empire Strikes Back".
Cartoon sound effects?
Finally: THE MOVIE WAS JUST PLAIN SILLY.
And also, there was never a clear sky day in the previous movies, why was it that way in this one?

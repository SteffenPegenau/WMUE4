He was a strange character.
I thought he was robbed incredibly by the Oscars for not even getting a nomination.
He won a Comedic Actor Golden Globe for this role.
But there are other biopics that are much more interesting.
Comedic role???
If you do not care for Kaufman, do not bother with this film.
It had its moments of brilliance, and it had times that left you underwhelmed.
This film was a lot like the Kaufman.
Worth renting, not buying.
There doesn't seem to be an overall point to his life, other than to ammuse.
It alone is worth seeing.
Likewise for the movie.
More because of the subjects than the film making.On the plus side, Jim Carrey gives a wonderful performance.
No one could figure him out, so that is reflected in the film.
For what it is, it is good.

USPS SENT MY ITEM AUGUST 4, 2008 BUT NO ONE WAS HOME.
NO ONE EVEN CARE JUST BECAUSE I ALREADY PAID FOR IT.
THEY CLAIMED THEY HAD LEFT A PICK UP SLIP.
THE PICK UP SLIP I NEVER SAW/RECEIVED.
ACCORDING TO THE TRACKING LOG.
I HAVE NO PICK UP SLIP.
VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.
P.S.
I NEED MY BOOK OR PLEASE REFUND MY MONEY.
I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS ITEM.
UNTIL NOW, I DO NOT KNOW WHERE MY PACKAGE IS.
IS IT STILL IN THE POST OFFICE...IF IT IS, HOW CAN I PICK IT UP?
I DONT KNOW!!!!!
WAS THE PACKAGE SHIPPED BACK TO AMAZON?
I CONTACTED AMAZON THROUGH E-MAIL FEW TIMES AND NO ONE SEEM TO RESPOND AND ITS ALREADY AUGUST 31, 2008.
I HAVE TO RATE THIS ITEM 1 STAR SO THE SYSTEM WILL TAKE MY REVIEW EVEN IF I DID NOT RECEIVE MY ITEM.THIS IS REALLY DISAPPOINTING.

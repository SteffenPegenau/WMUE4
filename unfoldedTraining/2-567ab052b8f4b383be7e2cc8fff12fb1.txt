Oh, but shame on me...this is the FREE one!
After reading the reviews, many suggested reading the Coxwell Series before beginning this one.
Now to the part that really irritated me (besides the slow start), the ERRORS!
It took me till almost 50% of the book to become interested.
I am on Page 2 of "Double Trouble" and it already has omitted words and spelling errors!
I purchased the other 3 novels before beginning "Double Trouble".
I just finished reading Book #1 "Third Time Lucky'!
Book #2 will be the deciding factor!
I'm beginning to think this was a mistake!
The errors in this book were horrendous!
I can't believe I paid $5.00 for a book riddled with errors!
Hopefully, books #3 and #4 are better edited, that's if I ever read those books.
I recently came across a free book "Double Trouble" and read the reviews.
The reviews of "Double Trouble" seemed favorable enough.
The beginning was painfully slow!

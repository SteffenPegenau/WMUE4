The Soledad Brothers are about excitement.
If it is not broke, why fix it?
They are part of the rock and roll shrine based in Detroit right NOW!
All songs need a beat.
This is party record.
This is how rock and roll sounds today, right now.
Why add keyboards?
"Up Jumped The Devil" is like rockabilly blues.
Why record in the studio with a bunch of suits starring at you.
Johnny Walker is one of the most captivating lead singers in rock and roll.
"Teenage Heart Attack" sounds like they mainlined some exile on main street.
This CD is a document of that.
All time is circular: we are in the repeating moments of now.
Why write about a kid named Tommy?
This is the new rock revolution.
Sometimes they play with Meg White on drums.
Rock and roll is an experience that cannot be captured, oh yeah!
These are people who know who Mississippi Fred McDowell and John Lee Hooker are.
All songs need to rock hard or they are meaningless.
Get it today.

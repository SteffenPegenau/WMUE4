Lightnin' Bar Blues - very casual..its a Hoyt Axton cover.11.

Sweet Home Suburbia - ok6.

Visitor - great tune...left in lunacy!4.
THe original tapes are nowhere to be found from what i have been told.

As a result it can be remastered but not remixed properly.

No Law Or Order - not for me..but good.8.

Not worth the effort to get to the punchline.
The book is based around a society of people mostly of European descent that at most levels have a confrontational and aggressive policy towards Native Americans on the other side.
This book could've been so much more.
If your going to rewrite a "history" try being original.
Lame.
How about a storyline where indians and "settlers" get along?
Let me start by saying that I had high hopes for this book and its premise.
I got about half way through this dump of a book and couldn't take it anymore.
After the first chapter those hopes were dashed.
The book bases its storyline around a eurocentric point of view that, due to superior firepower, the indians are on the loosing end again.
Napalming a rogue band of "indians"?
To much Flash-Bang and repetitive themes and not enough substance.
Its just a case of alternate history repeating history.
Lame.
Just like it occured over here in real history.

It will load onto your computer everytime you plug it in.
Photosmart?
It's just a storage device.
I need to purchase a subscription.
AntiVirus?
Often the drive goes unrecognized and this happens on any computer I use.
Also the software is fairly useless and it gets in the way and slows work time.
It should be simple.
Game applications?
All of these are included aplications in the software and all require paid subecriptions to enable.
The practicality of the software depends on if I want to spend extra money: Do I want to use the Skype applications?
I have to unplug and plug back in the drive until it gets recognized (happens @ home, school, Kinkos, Staples, etc.)
If the information you're saving is important I recommend using another brand.
I have to buy a different drive and back-up constantly since I feel I am taking a risk whenever I use this device.Also, as stated in many other reviews, the user has no choice regarding the software of the device.
This is not simple.

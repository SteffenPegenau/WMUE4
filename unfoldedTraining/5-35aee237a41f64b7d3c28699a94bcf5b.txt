The Yamaha YSP is the only product to deliver.
This unit does an excellent job.
It can be had in the $500+ range, but has the same power output as the 4000/4050.
Less power is not worth the effort.
Have spent many hours playing with the manual settings.
The very painless auto calibration system works just as well.
Have purchased (and returned), other products that pretend to deliver (simulated or true) surround sound, 5.1.
Brilliant!
The YSP 1100 is the best value of the series.
It is scary to look to the extreme left or right and hear voices and see nothing there.
Very clean look.
The sound field is detailed and complexly powerful.
A sub-woofer is a must have.
None, on the market contain the achieved, high technology, with presence that this unit delivers.
Many surround sound units do not sound good with CDs.
Outstanding technology, well positioned as "state of the art".

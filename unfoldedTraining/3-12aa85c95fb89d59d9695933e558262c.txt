Three stars is good for me.
Good riddance.
I don't think it's quite as good as Stalking Darkness, but then again, I'm a sucker for angst.
I was interested in seeing where Ms. Flewelling would take us that would be new and I was not disappointed.
P.S.
We /and Alec finally get more information on Seregil's past and the new country has the intrigue we've come to expect.
Reading the reviews here made me happy.
P.S.S.
The homophobes stayed away.
It was worth the wait.
I tend to rank against other authors.
You can't beat the end of SD for angst.
Kay is a five.
G.G.
I have been haunting the book stores waiting for this book for 2 years.
Finally!

And they actually say in the manual that your alliances keep for one episode.
But overall, this is a HUGE improvment since the last game.
Although, it is somewhat like the first game.
But now, to "Survivor: Ultimate".
At tribal council, the graphics are much better.
I got it from the library and I thought that it was ok.
I had reviewed the first "Survivor: The Interactive Game".
This is such a big improvment since the last game!
I didn't like the survival periods.
If you are in the final four, if two people have a set person, that person that they planned to vote off, votes for him/herself!
Hopefully then, he wouldn't get voted off.
And instead of a video of Jeff snuffing a torch, he actually does it!!
But still.
It DOES repeat challenges, not always in the same order.
I just wish they had one with Rupert in it!
And the alliances actually keep!

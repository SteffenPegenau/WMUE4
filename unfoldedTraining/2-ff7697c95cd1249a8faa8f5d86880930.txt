He's annoying.
No longer.Every Bot's voice was poorly cast, with the lone exception of Mel Brooks.
The animation, while good, was not Pixar quality.
"Shut up already" was all I could think whenever he opened his mouth.
I was expecting a Pixar quality movie, you know, where adults are entertained as well?
Robin williams is not even close to being funny.
There can be only so many lame big-butt, fat rear, huge trunk jokes.
It seemed flat.
The first was cute.
We're all tired of the SAME voices he's used in every movie and stand up routine for decades.
The second lame.
The 20th pathetic.
Sure they were entertaining, in an idiot-savant way, in the 90's.
IF you're purchasing it for a brain-dead adult, or a kid under the age of 8, you're all set.Too bad that was not the intended target.
They tried - and failed.
Sorry I purchased the DVD.

SO, you just don't care about her, if she had a background that turned her into that kind of person or whatever.
I already knew Liv Tyler is nowhere near a good actress.
This movie is bad tasted.
The male characters attempt hard to be funny, but with mixed results.
The general result is a fiasco, a real turkey.
Maybe because I was searching for an easy and good laugh.
She is just unbearable.
In any case, I sure regret my choice.
Maybe I got "hooked" by this being the debut film of Michael Douglas company.
When you have a screenplay where you simple don't care about the main character, the movie is doomed.
What was I thinking when I rented this piece of garbage?
Liv's character is obnoxious.
So, what was the point?
It's no the kind of "anti-hero villain".
Maybe because it had Goodman, Dillon and even Reiser in the cast.

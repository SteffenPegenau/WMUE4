Some people say the books are better than the movie.
I want to see it again.
The seats were terrible, the sound wasn't calibrated right, etc.
And again and again.
The story just overwhelmed me.
The cinema was crappy & old.
I think I am addicted already.
If you have not seen this movie yet, you missed the best adventure ever.
Is that truly possible??
THE BEST.
I went to see the movie yesterday.
The movie embraced me and I simply forgot everything around me.
But you know what?
This is the best fantasy/sf film I have ever seen!!
I didn't care!
I have not read the books yet, but I plan to.
Go see it!

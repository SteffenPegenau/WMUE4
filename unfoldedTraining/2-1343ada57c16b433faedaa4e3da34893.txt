She was a victim of attempted murder.
Baine was funny.
But you never see what's under his mask.
Selina Kyle was not just some jewel thief.
He's not the villain... Zing!
The first half hour of the film could honestly be chopped off.
Then he decides to bounce?
Alfred made Bruce Wayne into batman.
Oh and Robin was a circus performer, not a Gotham city cop.
One thing I did like was the villain.
I could say more and more bad things about this, but frankly I have things to do.
Spoiler alert.
I had high hopes for this film, perhaps too high.
Next we have the unacceptable altering of characters.
My first issue was the story.
One more thing.
Especially his voice.

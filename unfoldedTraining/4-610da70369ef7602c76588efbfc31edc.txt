It was a better movie than any of the Transformers movies.
For whatever reason that made the whole thing better.
Was this a phenomenal movie?
I didn't even hate that CGI dog thing!
I just had no desire to see a Tarzan-esque guy running around fighting martians.
I knew nothing about the Burroughs stories.
I want a little more.
I sincerely hope that DVD sales are strong with this and Disney decides to make a sequel.
No.
I rarely want to see the next chapter in movies any more.
I don't need to see another Avengers movie.
I ended up liking John Carter as a character.
Case in point, The Avengers.
I will, but I don't need to.
I didn't know he was from late 19th century Earth.
I liked it but I didn't care about any of the characters.
I was really turned off by the marketing of this movie.

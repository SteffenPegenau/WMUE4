I love Nickel Creek.
I was wrong.
Can you hear me now?
I feel so bad saying this but this cd was mixed like crap.
Glen's voice was so loud and obnoxious.
Virtually every song on this albums was mixed the same way.
I was trying as hard as I could to listen to the music underneath but to no avail.
I listened to 3/4 of the song and could not take it anymore, so I skipped to the next song with the hope that the producer was going for a certain sound for that track, and that the rest would be fine.
I also love Toad, but for heavens sake, what is this?
As I listened to the first track in my car I audibly said to myself, "what the crap is this?"
Not that his voice was obnoxious but the fact that I could hear nothing other than his voice.
I can tell that the music would be beautiful if it were audible.
Yes glen, we can hear you.
I am glad to see that I am not the only one that has noticed this.
They are one of my favorite groups.

Lionel Richie, aside from Michael Jackson was the most important Cross-Over Artist of the 80's.
!
that video is still cold how when he talks to the Chick he just breaks it down like a true Mack.
on the real alot of Artists would want to have his Career.
I use to play this Album all the time.
but my main cut on this Album is "Love will a Find a way".
Lionel Richie is a great Musical Force.
"Hello!!!
and just like MJ he was Successful in a Group&then went Solo&turned it up a whole different notch.
Lionel Richie did it the right way.
is it me your'e looking for??
Lionel Richie truly shines on the Classics "All Night Long", Penny Lover,Penny Lover.
then of course the Telephone Anthem "Hello".
this Album was OUTRAGIOUS!!!!!
that Groove is wicked.
Lionel Richie did it all.
that was on point.

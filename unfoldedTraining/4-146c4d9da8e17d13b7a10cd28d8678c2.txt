The attack from the birds isinexplicable.
If the animals were worms or something else, then story would be unbelievable and stupid.Another thing I like is the relation from the birds and the nature.
The birds stand in this book for all nature disaster.
And today the book get read again and again.
I think the book birds von Daphne du Maurier is a good short novel.
Because of the shortness, the book can't become boring.I like that the story is mysterious.
I think it's a ingenious representaion.The book is timeless.
It's a little bit short, but that is not really bad.
The birds are able to kill a woman or a man.
It also have a relation to the war.
But in spite of them, the story is believable, because the attack is possible.
In some years the book will probably be as popular as now.
It's just an other representation.
Daphne du Maurier wrote this book brief after the second world war.
It's not the usual behaviour of birds.

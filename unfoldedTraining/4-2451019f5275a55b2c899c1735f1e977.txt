I have made a gift of it to my favorite people.
It is written with wit, lightheartedness, sensitivity and sincerity.
Share it.
The bottom line is you are out there.
This book reminds us that this is the ongoing universal desire.
It has been received with smiles of relief & is proudly displayed on the coffee table.
Thank you for the poignant messages.
Being married is great as was being single.
I was, however, single for 36 years.
The book reminds us that we cope first as an individual.
I am married.
Such an obvious notion yet it gets lost in the muck.
Deal with that before you try to be a partner.
Alone.
Even if you are in a relationship.
I especially appreciated the references to the idea that at some point we are all single in this life.
The messages in this book are so important to not lose sight of, no matter one's status.
Read it.
This book is an affirmation of LIFE, however you live it, i.e., the concept of being the best person you can possibly be.

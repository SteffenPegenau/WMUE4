The only down fall is that you WILL DEMAND MORE.
Not sure how to start ?
Instead of buying different albums or discs trying to figure them out start here.
You can and you will with this.
For those just starting out as Beatles fans.....Welcome.
Without a doubt this is the best way for a new fan to start.
You will find that this is more then worth it's price and a better start then "1" or Past Masters.
They say you can't ware out a CD.
I was very happy to open this disc and see it on Apple too.
Dont let the heavy price get you.
You'll play these songs over and over again.
This is the start and pretty much the best of their early work and hits.
Look no further.
It will bring alive The Beatles and yea your going to get hooked.
Enjoy and please also see my review on the 1967 - 1970 disc too./No Neck

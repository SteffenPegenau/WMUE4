But for now this will do.
worth it.
Mirror's dark edge and Mostastless' lyrical delivery.
Worth the money and time.
I'm looking forward to Mutant more, which is out in late July, because of it's supposed all rock feel.
I've fallen into the light of bands like White Zombie.
A rap group with a horror/rock edge.
So songs are a tad boring but, Jamie and Paulie came through on this.
But, I've always liked Twiztid's lyrics, performance, history, so I decided to give it a shot.
They bring so much to the table with content ranging from urban myths to politcal views to religion.
First off, I haven't listened to Psychopathic music in a good 2 years.
The album is a step back to Mirror/Mirror and Mostastless.
Easliy beats Green Book and Freek Show.
If you've never heard Twiztid give them a chance, they are def.
With this set aside, I don't listen to rap anymore.

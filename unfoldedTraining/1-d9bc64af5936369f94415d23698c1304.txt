I agree with Cjnk, very poorly made.
You have to stretch the rubber strap to force it on the catch hook.
Therefore, you have to wrap them around your brake cable.
This solved most of my problems.
A little manufacturing Q.A.
The slots on the strap are 90 degrees off ( | vs. - ) so they do not line up with the catch hook.
If you have the Topeak Handlebar Stabilizer, try replacing the rubber strap with a Velcro strap.
Which leads me to the next problem... the strap broke.
testing would have caught this.
Any amount of stretching and it will eventually crack and break.
So you're not able to replace, adjust, etc.
Same problems with the rubber strap and it's catch hook.
my rear brake with it installed.
Another issue with the strap is it is too thick to go under the exposed brake cable under my bike's top tube.
Mostly constructed of plastic, which makes easily breakable and not something you can throw around in the shop.

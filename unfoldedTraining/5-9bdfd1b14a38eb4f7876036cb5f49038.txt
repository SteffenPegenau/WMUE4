When they go to the winner's circle Pride tried to bite L and they leave.
I miss him so much as I continue to read this series.
They think Pride is burnt out because of his injury.
Ashleigh doesn't think she can go on without him, especilly when B and L didn't tell Ashleigh that Jilly couldn't ride and put up a jockey from Mexico who listens to B and L's instructions but not Ash's.
Okay, first Brad and Lavinia get this million+ horse and think he is better than Pride.
They try all sorts of tricks to get to Ashleigh and she is getting married too.
Shows those snobby Townsend Acres brats that Whitebrook always comes out on TOP!
But then Pride beats their horse, Lord Ainsley.
Charlie was soooooo cool!
At Ashleigh's wedding Charlie has a heart attack and dies!
It is one of my favorite books ever!
:(!!!
He holds Pride back and almost ruins him, then Pride breaks away and wins anyway.
This book was sooo good!
Lavinia and Brad are furious.
Lavinia and Brad are furious.
Oh my gosh!

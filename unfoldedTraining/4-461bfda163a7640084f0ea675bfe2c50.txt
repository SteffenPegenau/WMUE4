Plugged it in and BAM.
Very sleek and very powerful!
I was using a Eureka True Hepa (7 years old) and I thought it was great until I used this new vacuum.
Love the color and design.
I just purchased this vacuum yesterday.
Put it together this morning by myself with a screwdriver.
Attachments were also easy to place.
The lift-off canister is wonderful.
Very, very easy.
The Eureka will be out in the trash on Wednesday morning for sure.
I had no problems taking it up and down the stairs.
I couldn't believe how much dust, food and my own hair it had picked up.
The only downfall, in my opinion, is that it doesn't cook or clean the toilets.
I've read other posts that say it's heavy, but it's really not that heavy unless you're under 60 lbs yourself.
It moves freely and really does a wonderful job.
I have 3 small children and you wouldn't even know they lived here.

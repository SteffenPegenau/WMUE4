A little too typical.
I know there are alot of hardcore Eragon fans out there, and this is just my opinion.
It was my dream to become a writer, and this guy was only fifteen.
When I read this book I was in fourth grade and had alot of hope.
I would read something, and groan, wondering how I didn't see that coming.
What do I mean by lacking?
What I found was the typical fantasy book.
Not to mention the lack of leading ladies.Worth reading?
I think he could use some more experience...It was so predictable.
But, alas, the evidence is staring me right in the face.I wanted to like this book, I really did.
I had read Eragon, and it was simply mediocre (sp?)
Well....
When I heard Paolini was stealing from other authors, I didn't believe it.
Nope.
But I had heard such great reviews and I decided to give it a chance.

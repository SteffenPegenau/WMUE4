Like seeing random movie cowboys talk to a horse or a guy on a beach while listening to "Religions, Inc."?
It's just too bad there aren't quality products on the market that can accomplish this.
As a Lenny Bruce fan, I know why someone should see it.
Owning it, however, is a somewhat empty gesture.
It's the best that can be done.
Most of the action consists of random b.s.
It's too bad that sequences featuring Bruce are few, far between, and oftentimes too brief.
I would rather have an unedited tape of whatever Lenny footage one could scrounge up, laid on a VHS tape than to own this.
I own it, though, and am glad I do.
film clips playing while a Bruce voice over plays.
I wish they would make a Lenny Bruce best of tape that is somewhat sensical.
When the footage is of Bruce, it's worth seeing.
This thing is more like a lame head-shop film.
Then go for it.
There are some bits on here that I haven't heard elsewhere, and it is nice to see Lenny Bruce in action.

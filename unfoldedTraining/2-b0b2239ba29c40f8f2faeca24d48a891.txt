Also, the enemy is so stinkin' stupid.
While if you're not playing on Glide, forget this game.
So much cool stuff is being thrown at you and the voices that do it are so boring they're going to sound like your boss or teacher, no lies.
That's about the only good thing this game has to offer.
Bottom Line: Get this if you like RPGs or FPS but don't mind slowdowns.
I don't want to give it away, but the storyline is great.
JC Denton, which is you, is just a monotone scratchy voice act.
First of all, let me say this game is good.
To begin, saving and loading times are insane.
You'll never run it and have fun.
Voice acting is hideous.
As long as you move behind something in a second or two, he'll think it was nothing and move along.
You were right in front of him, for crying out loud!
So why do I only see 2 stars, you say?
You can crawl in front of them, and they'll say something like,"I think I heard something.
It stinks!

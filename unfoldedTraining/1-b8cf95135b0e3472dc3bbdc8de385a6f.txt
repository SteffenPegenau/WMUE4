It states that there is a 4 year warranty.
Then even if you bought this product elsewhere, their warranty terms are so restrictive, you have to fill out forms in a certain number of days, and also pay an expensive handling fee.
Just because I bought it at Amazon.
I have bought several other irons, hoping to find one that will last.
Sorry.
In th end, the unit simply stopped heating up, after only 6 months of use.
And the manufacturer refused to stand behind their product.
that's useless.
Then 6 months later, it stops working.
Very disappointing.
They clearly state that they will NOT warranty any product from Amazon.
You buy this product thinking you are obtaining a quality product, for the price.
So this has no warranty.
No there is not.
I decided to spend extra and overpay for this one hoping it would be better.

Here's my list of the greatest hits, and notice about 95% was left out of the album:1.
I'm was a Staind fan from the beginning and first of all they left out so much of their great early stuff, instead they only put the radio songs that made them popular, and second off all, greatest hits albums should have 20 songs, and forget covering other bands, no one can cover a great song like the original.
Fray20 So Far AwayAnd their you go, If you really want a good greatest album write your own and e-mail the list to them.

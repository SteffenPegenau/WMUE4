What a complete and total ripoff.
Tried taking out the battery and putting it back.
In the middle of playing a song, it simply cut off.
It didn't even show the normal start up screen with the droplets of water.
Buyers BEWARE.
Nothing.
I cannot believe I spent my money on this.
Just straight to a screen reading CREATIVE, and is now COMPLETELY unresponsive.
I put it on my belt, took it off, and the EXTREMELY cheap plastic was broken.Then, after about 30 minutes of play, the device stopped working entirely.
This is a TOTAL piece of you know what.
I am going to get my money back and buy an IPOD.
Completely.
I mean instantly.
The thing wouldn't even shut down any more.
I got this product, followed the sparse directions, first charging for three hours until fully charged, then loading the software, then loading my music.The first thing I noticed was that the belt clip broke INSTANTLY.

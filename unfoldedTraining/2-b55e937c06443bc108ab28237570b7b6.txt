It is considered a young adult read.
They give a reading age of (9-12).
Everyone was telling us it was a great book but couldn't remember details.
The girl also kills several animals, all without much feeling if any.
The content of the book is a bit much for a child who loves family and animals.
My daughter is an advanced reader but I would not want her reading this book until she was much older.
The father is killed along with most of her tribe.
As far as I'm concerned it was an okay read, but for now it will stay on the shelf.
I am glad I did.
My daughter is 9 and received this book for Christmas.
I decided to read it before my daughter.
The book starts off with the mother already having died.
She is a child.
My daughter is not an adult of any kind.
To top it all off the little brother is also killed.

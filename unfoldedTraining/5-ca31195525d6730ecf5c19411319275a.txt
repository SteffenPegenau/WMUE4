I've never read a book written by an adult with adult subject matters sounding like it was written by a first grader.
Something totally lousy to help us appreciate the good stuff.
See?
Over and over again I kept thinking "how did this get published?"
If everything was outstanding you wouldn't know how truly good it was after awhile.
And don't we all need that now and then.
The Lake is like cleansing your palette so to speak.
You may have to read this book just to see what I mean.
So let's thank Richard for this ludicrous novel.
I gave it five stars because I don't like to give negative reviews, but holy cow this book was beyond ridiculous.
How does a publishing house read this and think to themselves "we have a winner!"
And actually it will help you to enjoy better authors like Connelly, Baldacci, and Sandford even more.
This was easily the dumbest book I've ever read.
Totally childish.
I can find the positive in everything.
And not the writing style per se, but the content.

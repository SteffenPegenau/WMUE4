I have downloaded digital copies before and since.
I wanted a digital copy I could download to my ipad and my ipod.
I will just go buy a digital copy somewhere other than Flixster for sure from now on.
I brought this movie back on December 9 and here it is February 1 and still I do not have a digital copy.
I purchased this digital copy along with my DVD, but had I known what Flixster was all about I would not have.
So I contacting Flixster again.
So Flixster sent me a digital copy, but when I tried to download it through itunes it would not work.
This is the first time a have written a review on anything.
I just do not understand why I can not seem to get a working digital copy from Flixster.
I am just so furstrated with this.
I am so fed up with this.
It is not complicated to send a digital copy that works.
And when I tried to download again through itunes, again it did not work.
The movie was good and very funny.
Again they sent me another digital copy.

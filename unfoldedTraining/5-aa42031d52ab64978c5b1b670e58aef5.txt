I'll make a bet with you that next you will be planting a herb and veggie garden.

I got my 1st Lodge pan 45 years ago.
Just a thought.
and learn to LOVE your IRON.
Most of my Ironware were throw anways.

I love the food at IHOP!!!
If you can imagine it you can make it!!!!!!!
It was rusted but I learned how to clean and season the pan.
I DON'T however like their prices or noise level.
Get creative.. Stay creative..

Bon Appetite!!!
I did buy a griddle for the only reason to make breakfast for me girlfriend on the back porch before a dip in the hotub.

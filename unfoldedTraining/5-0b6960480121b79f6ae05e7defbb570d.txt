and whew, the smirk at the end of the show.
One of the best sex scenes, I think!And just for good measure.
You could almost hear....its gonna be a heartache tonite.
The Man is a Master Story Teller.
In my sweeter opinion, he should win ever damn award there is.Now to the episodes, of my choice:1.Something Blue.
I about pissed my pants when we watched it first.
Wouldn't that be nice!
Go Spike!2.Pangs.
Ohhh.
We all want more romance/sex/love.
Have Mercy!3.Wild at Heart.
But, I have to say, I did like the Willow/Tara arc.
Just wished, that after Tara ,that Xander & Willow, would have gotten back together.
Loved the line from Spike"don't care if its playing, bloody,'rock the kazbah', just get it out".
Go Oz!
I liked "Beer Bad", & also "Hush".
I just adore this truly hilarious masterpiece.
Simple as that.
Maybe, just maybe (my fingers crossed really tight) on "Angel".

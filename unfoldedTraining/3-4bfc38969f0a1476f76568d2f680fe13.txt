Apple Market, Downtown, Uptown, City Hall, and Old City.
You play as a boy named Mega Man who was found by an old man(forgot his real name, just call him gramps).
Gramps answers, he will.
Inside that door is a city.
The city is divided into 5 pieces.
On the island named Katalox Mega Man runs down a trail, but before he does a police car comes.
But their ship starts falling onto an island named Katalox!That's when Gramps runs into the engine and try to fix the ship.
Run back to the ship wreck and talk to the sheriff.
He says later, One of you will have to come with us.
In the Old City watch out for dogs... as they will attack you.
That should have encouraged you.
A cut scene will appear.
Follow the trail which leads you to Apple Market.
Now I'm not going to tell anymore.You'll have to find the rest out by BUYING the game.
This is an okay game.
But it is no use.
Sneak up in somebodys conversation and you will get a pass to a door you couldn't get to before.

We don't have any complaints as of yet.
I hope this review helps.
Thanks!
The pool cover is also great.
As far as other complaints...You get what you pay for.
Our back yard isn't completly level but it works great.
If you go into this with the expectations of the durability of a built in pool you are going to be disapointed.
It takes common sense.
For the price it is worth it.
They love it!
We love it!
The pump is so quiet you won't have any complaints from neighbors.
The pool is made of plastic.
When we put it up next season we will try to get the ground more level.
...It took my husband about 30 minutes to set up and start filling it.
We have five chlidren 6,9,10,11,and,12 years of age.
Even if I had to replace the whole pool every summer, it is affordable and worth it.

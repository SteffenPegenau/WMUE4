Interesting enough, they are arguing over Elizabeth, the girl neither has been with.
And that's too bad, because I actually like Dana.
She needs a good punch in the face.
As for Todd, he has been over Elizabeth for a very long time, so his arguing with Tom doesn't make much sense to me.
Quit kissing Jessica's ***.
This book was the cure to my insomnia.
And Jessica, the immature, whiny, spoiled brat!!
I guess Laurie John wants us to believe that no guy can get over Elizabeth, and truly fall in love with another girl.
I'm sick of Elizabeth.
But not over Dana, the girl they have both slept with.
And I was hoping Pam gave it to her.
I see Todd and Dana's breakup already, because she has done a complete 180 and become clingy too fast.
I can honestly say that I really don't care if Elizabeth and that punk Sam hooks up or not.
I'm with Neil.
I just hope that by the next book they have Tom Watts acting like the dignified reporter that I know he still is.

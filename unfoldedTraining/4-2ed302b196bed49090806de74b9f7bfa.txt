;o)
Did not rise and ended up as a too dense rock.
And the clean up was easy.)
Guess I'll have to watch her.
Like cinnamon rolls and monkey bread and chocolate bread!!!
Just got my Panasonic last week and immediately made two loaves -- one basic white, which was beautiful (rose a little high, but is more bread a problem?
I think the wheat loaf would be better with more milk/water or less flour or perhaps a combo of wheat and bread flours.
Next time I will use plain old molasses.
Only problem was that my daughter burrowed a hole through the soft middle!
The wheat loaf was not so good.
A lot like my grandmother's homemade bread.
MMMMM!!
and tasted SO good.
Along with the good-for-you-stuff too, of course!
Could taste the yeast and was yummy.
Anyway, we are pleased with the overall outcome (my fam LOVES white bread and I never buy it) and I can't wait to try more recipes!
Tasted okay, but I used blackstrap molasses and the irony flavor of the molasses was too strong, my fault.

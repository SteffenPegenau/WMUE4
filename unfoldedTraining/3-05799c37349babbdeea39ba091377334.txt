I mean, yeah, most action things use a lot of brass.
But this is just noise.
It's ok, if that.
If you don't have The Mummy, or The 13th Warrior, or Sleep Hollow.
It's ok score, but only buy it if you find a couple bucks laying around that you don't need.
He could have made it so much more interesting.
After The Mummy, which was pretty well done, and The 13th Warrior which is a great score, I think he'd be the best person for the job.
Don't waste your money.
But oh well, I can't make the decision for who does what.
It's not very clever.
I would've rather Jerry Goldsmith do this picture.
You might find some things that might please you, but not much.
I mean, I loud brass, in your face stuff.
The brass is a little TOOOOOOOO powerful.
Umm..........well.........what can I say about it.
You'll get great music out of that.
But tone it down a little bit.
The action parts of it, is practically noise.

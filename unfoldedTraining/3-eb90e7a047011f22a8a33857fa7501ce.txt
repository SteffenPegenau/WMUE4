Some of my fav.
"Carry On"- Decent.
Ashanti, the name we always hear in the R&B world...... First off, I will say that her first album failed to impress me.. but the second album...
"Rock Wit' You (Awww Baby)" although she is stuck on "Awww Baby, Oooh Baby" 3/52.
"Feels So Good"- A decent track!
The vocals are decent, she has a good voice.
(A remake though)5/54.
The Story of 2"- remake of "Dream Maker" 5/5Overall, Chapter II is a decent release that I think could grow on you.....
4/57. "
It certainly grew on me!
5/56.
5/53.
"I Found Lovin'"- One of the best!!
songs are:1.
"Rain On Me"- The best track!!
"Break Up 2 Makeup"- one of the best!
!, although I think it is a remake.
I feel it is an impressive sophomore release but, Ashanti has a long way to go as an artist.
5/55.

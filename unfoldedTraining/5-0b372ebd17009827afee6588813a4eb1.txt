Hurray.
You will have to watch and find out.a great transfer.
I cant believe this never got a wide release in north america.
The body parts scattered about are enough to get the squad to give up their training mission and get out of the woods.
Oh well.
This movie brings werewolves back from the fringes.We have some english soldiers on a training mission in the highlands of scottland.
They are there to skirmish with some special ops guys.
Of course, its too late.
a must have.
A local pack of werewolves are doing some hunting of their own.The troops shack up in an abandoned house and fight as wave after wave of attacks begins.
Its not long before the grunts find the remains of the special ops camp.
clean, crisp and colorfull.
This is one great movie.
Pfffft.
We get garbage like American Werewolf in paris instead.
Is this one enemy these troops can't defeat?

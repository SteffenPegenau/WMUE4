Just not very many.
Surely there is something more to do then to watch this flick.
Woody is always interesting as the nervous, paranoid, type A, personality.
He always comes across as needing psychological help.
A couple of good scenes.
Watch something else.
Ugh.
Take a bath, wash your hair.
The cut-backs to the Greek Stage Act scenes were absolutely horribly boring.
That is about it.
Trim your fingernails.
Egads.
A couple of laughs.
But, the whole movie was below trite and trival.
But, there are a few worse movies then this one.

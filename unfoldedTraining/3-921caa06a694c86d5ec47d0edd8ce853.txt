What's a shame is that the VHS version was recorded in "very long play" mode.
I was waiting for the DVDs hoping to see the job done right.
I own them all.
The whole series was done this way.
I believe people would pay more for better quality.
Anything worth doing, is worth doing right.
I am glad I do because having these wonderful stories are worth the poor media/production.
I am sorry to say that I will not buy them.
Mr. McMurtry has been done an injustice and his fans have been done a disservice in the name of maximum profit and maximum economy.
I really, really like Lonesome Dove and this video production of the story.
I give them 5 stars.
It is a shame.
Very poor quality viewing.
Can barely make it track on my machine.
Now I hear that the DVD is substandard as well.

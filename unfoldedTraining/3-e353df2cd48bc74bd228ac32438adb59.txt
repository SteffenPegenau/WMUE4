As an action movie it is one of the '90's best.
I recommened Tomorrow Never Dies (My FAVE!!!)
As a Bond movie it is NOT my favorite!
But it is not very memroable.
It does follow the "Bond Formula" but the plot is based on pure action, there is no chacter devolpment(which I think is bad because after a six year abscence from the silver screen I would like to see how the character has changed.
Move over SEAN, Brosnan = Bond!
It also can drag.
His perfomance was fantastic.
As a Bond film, it lacks quite a bit.
However the case with the film is quit different.
It plot is not rienforced, and is based around violence, there is no real character devolpment which makes it fun to watch.
but watch it and see for yourself.
He was a little rigid at times, but in my opinion is 007.
As an action movie it is spectaluar.
Goldeneye is the 17th movie in the legandary 007 saga stars Pierce Brosnan as James Bond.

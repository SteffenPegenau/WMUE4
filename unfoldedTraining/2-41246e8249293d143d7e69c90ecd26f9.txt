A lot of scenes are there only to help the book growing thick.
Not only is it full of stereotypes (maybe this is a book who generated these stereotypes, I don't know).
Wow!".
The story itself?
Well, not big deal.
Again, the stereotype of a stranger that tries to invade, and intestine plottings to add some (watery) thrill.
I approached this book with, well, great expectations.
They are far from having the precise contours of Tolkien's heroes.
The characters are so thin that after a few weeks I have forgotten all of them.
A few minutes after finishing it I said "Well!
They are far from having the depth of Ursula le Guin's characters.
All in all, an easy book: easy to read and easy to forget.
However, as time goes by, I cannot stop thinking that actually the book is not so good.
It is rather like a first attempt of the author to write fantasy.
Even in the Wheel of Time cycle one could find heroes that are better realised than these ones.

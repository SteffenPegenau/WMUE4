They have earned the right to experiment, and that's exactly what they did.
311 is the greatest band that I, personally have ever heard.
dON'T GET ME WRONG!
If your a 311 fan, you may want to sit this one out!
Every cd that they have ever put out, has blown me away.
Lack of 311 origianlity, rythym, and melodies make them sound like a new band.That's ok with me.
!I'm sure the next one will be better!
Quite honestly, the rest is really bad.
I really don't like this cd much at all.
There are about 3 good songs on the cd.
I still love 311 and have been waiting for them to put out one bad cd like every band does.
From Chaos was a great return to their grassroots birth.
Well, friends.... this one is it.
Cd after cd has been great for more than a decade.But!!

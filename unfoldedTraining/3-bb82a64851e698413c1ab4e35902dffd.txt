Excellent musicians.
What on eathbound happened here.
I suggest to get them on a different release.
Apparently this was remasterd by Fripp and Tony Arnold.
First off I will start by saying that I'm a big fan of K.C.
It sounds very thin.
They are available on numerous other compilations and on the original versions of the albums from which they were culled.
Every incarnation included.
Fantastic compositions.
If you want these tunes on C.D.
Being a pro musician with many hours of studio time under my belt I feel that I have enough experienece to know that what I'm saying / hearing is accurate.
But something went horribly wrong during the remastering process of this release.
There is a very obvious lack of bottom end on this release.
The musicians, compositions and performances get 5 stars but the remaster problems allows for 1 star.
Thus 3 Stars for this problematic C.D.
Let's get to the point.

I liked that a lot.I also LOVE the two soundtrack options.
Ann figured out creative ways to keep your baby in your arms or close to your face in almost all of the poses.
It helps keep things new.
Half the time she falls asleep while we do it!Ann offers helpful comments for those who had c-sections, also.
I love it!
I love it.
I LOVE this DVD.
The baby always needed me before I could get 10 minutes into it!But THIS is different!
You can pick calm piano music or more upbeat new-agey music.
I really like it.I highly recommend this DVD to all new moms!
I have looked and looked for a practice that I could do with my baby.
I had the hardest time trying to find time to exercise or do yoga after the baby came, and I looked everywhere.
Your baby is in every single pose.
My baby loves it!

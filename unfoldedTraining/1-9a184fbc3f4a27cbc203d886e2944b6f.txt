It is not the case this time.
This product has tons of awful reviews.
It looks fantastic in the box.
I contacted the company and they wanted me to send the boat back at my expense.
It just sat there doing nothing.
Didn't do anything.
Just sat there.
They also offered a replacement at $18 if I didn't want to send the boat back.
So, I get to pay $20 for nothing.Normally I like buying from Amazon, because shipping is not a hassle and the vendors are good.
That boat took way too long to arrive and it didn't work.
I took that offer, since it was going to cost me $11 shipping anyway.
I got this boat for my son for Xmas.
Unfortunately, all the good reviews were stacked at the top, and the bad reviews were further down, and one after another.I would not recommend anyone purchase this product.
When we finally got to a lake to race it, it didn't work.
Now they want me to pay to send back both boats, before I'll get a refund.

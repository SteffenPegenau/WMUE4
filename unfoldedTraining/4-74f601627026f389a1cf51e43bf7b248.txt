For God sake, let Trower wail!!!
Pattison is singing with passion.
And the guitar is the shining star.
The vocals are also good.
Especially on track #9.
The only complaint I have on this cd is the fade outs.
Anyone interested in playing blues guitar should listen to this.
Maybe that is the point, but I feel this could have been a major cd if the sweet sounding guitar being played by a true legend was allowed to playout on the endings.
Shining Through is a great song all the way thru, with extremely strong guitar.
This is the 1st cd I have purchased in a while that I can honestly listen to each song and enjoy.
A blueprint of great blues guitar.
Being a guitar player myself, I definitely want to hear more.
Every song is good.
Trower has great feel and tone -while not over playing.
Every song has too quick of a fade out.
A few songs almost fade before pattison can get his last vocal in.

Could I put it down?
Yes, somewhat.
Not really.
That story was so touching and insightful, I ran to the bookstore everytime another one of his collections of wise words was released.
Here again, no different.
While his thrid book, A WALK TO REMEMBER, did redeam him a little bit after that nightmare, MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, it was not nearly the repeat performance I was still expecting.
Especially if you have expectations about Sparks's stories aleady.
Entertaining?
I have been faithful to Nicholas Sparks since I first read THE NOTEBOOK.
If you are curious, i might be willing to commit to its worthiness of paperback.
Or, just wait for the movie that is sure to follow.
Would I recommend it?
Don't run to the bookstore (or the web page) to buy it.
Yes, definately.
The story is predictable, sappy, cheesy, and ... predictable.
Unfortunately, I set myself up for disappointment, again.

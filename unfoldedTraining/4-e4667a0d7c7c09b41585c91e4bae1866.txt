There are also a lot of different stages like River City and Junkyard.There is a wide variety of Mechs too.
All of them have three types weapons.
The ballistic weapons are like your macheine guns.
They also have special abilities like flying, becoming invisable, and shooting out chaffs.
The energy weapons are the strongest.
This game is very fun and is worth every dollar!
Under multiplayer there are many types of games such as tag, destruction, and grinder.
I think it's the best fighting Xbox game I've played.
Mech Assault is a fun game.
They are all very useful.
From fast to slow and from strong to weak.
There are two main modes: Campaign and Multiplayer.
Those are your lasers and of course the missile weapons are missiles.
They are ballistic, energy, and missile.
Both are fun but I like Multiplayer better.

Right off the bat after installing, I couldn't login with the Kindle.
20-30 feet away I couldn't watch Netflix on Kindle.
I'm not going to return this unit.
Just purchased this to replace cheaper DR-601 model.
Well, not satisfied for a couple of reasons.
But I'm dissatisfied.
So after researching, this DIR-615 seemed to fill the bill.
So now, operating with "pants down and curtains wide open", I decided to check the range of this new $70 router.
Only after re-installing the router under OPEN security would the Kindle connect.
My only wireless device is a Kindle Fire, which worked o.k.
with cheaper router but the range was lacking.
The $30 DR-601 router did not have this issue.
So I'm stuck.
Well, the signal dropped off at the same spot and to the same level of weak-signal as the $30 router.
Wouldn't accept the password.

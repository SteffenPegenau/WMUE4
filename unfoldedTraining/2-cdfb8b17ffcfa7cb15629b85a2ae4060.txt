Lucky for me, my cousin got all three of them instead of me.
C'mon.
All they talk about is shootin Bone and smokin.
A third of the time, they're just mumbling.
This album is just pitiful.
"Pimpology" was my jam.
"Still Po Pimpin" isn't better than the first one.
Overall, this album is trash.
The beat is good and all but the song is pitiful.
Bone don't got time to be dealing with Do or Die right now.
If you see this album in stores just walk away from it.
To be honest to you, I think they're trying to be like Bone.
But it was aight.
It had an ok beat and it was chillin.
"Bustin Back" just shows how badd they are.
Listenin to the first one on the mic, at one part it sound like he just making noise.
The first album I thought was their best work.
Don't get it.
They should just change their style.

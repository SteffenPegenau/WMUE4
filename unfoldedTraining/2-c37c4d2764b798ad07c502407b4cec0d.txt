Delinquent Words
I Knew You Would Leave4.
In one of his few interviews, he said that he had only intended to release one album, but after he got a few good reviews, he decided that he better keep on going.
It has a similar sound to the first album, with strange lyrics whispered/mumbled while accompanied by seemingly random notes plucked on an out-of-tune guitar.
This was the second album by the reclusive Jandek, which he released three years after his first album.
Jandek is definitlely an acquired taste.
Can I See Your Clock5.
Point Judith3.
You're the Best One9.
Since this album has come out, he has released an average of two albums a year.
Here is the track listing:1.
Hilltop Serenade8.
Feathered Drums2.
Anyway, Jandek's second album is even less accessable than his first album, if that's possible.
Wild Strawberries6.
Forgive Me7.
But somehow, it is even harder to listen to than the first album.

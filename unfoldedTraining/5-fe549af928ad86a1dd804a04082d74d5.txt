Some of them are maybe not as earth shattering as Bewilderbeast.
I heard some of the songs on this new album then.
As you get further into this album, it does seem wonderful.
Songs like "Easy Love" and "Summertime In Wintertime" are as good as it gets.
This third proper album may be a return to the days of Bewilderbeast.
His live show is a different story altogether.
It is trendy to dispose of heroes who were so dear to us a few years ago.
Damon Gough has put out three or four records now.
Gough plays long three-hour shows and plays songs from all his records.
Most of the songs are efforts of mysterious beauty.
He switches between guitar and piano, and Gough plays alone and with a group.
They are all good.
Badly Drawn Boy is something that deserves our attention.
Before I saw him in November 2003, I thought, like most, that Have You Fed The Fish was a misfire.
It sounds a lot better now.
When you hear these songs live, you appreciate the albums more.

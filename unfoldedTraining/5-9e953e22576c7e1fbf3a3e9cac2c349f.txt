If you like this album buy the rest.
I swear you wont be disapointed!
His pounding the drums is INTENESE!
This isnt even their best one and its still a 5 starer.
He has to be the best drummer around.
Support Pantera and buy this album.
PLEASE!
Dimebag is one of the best axe players EVER!
Every Pantera album is a 5 starer, ok "tredkill" was a four.
I own every album.
And Phil Anselmo is a great singer!
Lets not forget some one who is always over looked...Vinnie Paul.
First off.
I usally hate spending money on CD's but not for these guys.
Pantera rocks like non other.
You guys are completly insane.

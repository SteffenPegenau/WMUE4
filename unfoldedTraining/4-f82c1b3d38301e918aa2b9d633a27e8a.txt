Yep.
It's great, but it isn't covered in gold.
My then 10 month old daughter went straight to it and sat on it.
I can't believe this is the price.
This is a great great toy if you can get for maybe $35.00 or less.
I mean SHOCKED.
But it hasn't flipped over yet.
She finds it necessary to climb up in it, turn around and THEN sit down.
She has enjoyed in the several months since, very much.
Still shocked.
She started playing with it immediately.
Brought it home, it looked as new as this picture does.
I just have to start with how shocked I am at the price of this item.
I can't see paying $200.00 for this.
I own this, purchased from a yard sale for $5.00.
Cleaned it for safety and set it down.
$5.00.

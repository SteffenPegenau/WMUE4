BUT,It was shipped with an upholstery brush and a crevice tool.
This vac is not cheap.
A high school kid would have done a better job.
No extensions and no floor tool .
Most shop type vacs I've ever purchased came with plenty of extension and attachments.
In order to use it I'd have to kneel on the floor.
O.O.
so the vacuum itself is excellent... great power.. very quiet.
So, where is all that wonderful engineering.
This isn't a machine that Momma is likely to use in the living room and it's kind of overkill for cleaning the car.
So, o.k., I'll order an extesion and a floor tool.
This is lame.
Plus the floor tool is so loose it regularly falls off.
They arrive and the extension is around 16 inches long.

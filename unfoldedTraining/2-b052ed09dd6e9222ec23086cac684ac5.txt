In hindsight .
Overall, my kids played with it for hours at a time before it started having problems----now (only a few weeks later) it is in a non-functioning heap in the playroom.
First, the wheels that shoot the cars around the track started getting off track, causing friction, thus it couldn't get the power it needed to shoot the cars up and around the track anymore.
.
They LOVED playing with it for 4-5 days, but that's when it started having problems.
The cars can't move around it properly.
Currently, besides that happening, the track mis-aligned somehow, so one part of the ramp is too high, another too low, etc.
.
.
I have a 3 & 4 year old that reeeeeeally wanted this for Christmas.
no Hot Wheels.
not a wise purchase.
Several times my husband took that part apart to fix it, and it worked fine for awhile, then it'd start all over again.
.
Also, only certain cars (one comes with it) have the right weight and size to work on the ramp .

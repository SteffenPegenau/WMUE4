This video game is an insult to the consumer's intelligence.
My 4-year old asked me, "Mommy, what's wrong with their faces?"2.
How many guy-oriented video games have the actual athletes' voices?
If not, that would have been VERY NICE!5.
Incredibly irritating Parrot and Brutus, the monkey.
How about a map or something?
Gender-bias in that the voices sounded like those from a cheap anime video.
Overall, the plot was too simple and did not hold my children's attention very well.
My old Super Mario games had maps...and that was Nintendo!4.
I didn't check.
I found myself trying to outrace Brutus for the gems all the while missing out on the mission and visual surroundings.
It's easy to get lost if you don't have the best sense of direction....what 4-year old does?
I'll cut to the chase:1.
The "progress" chart was pointless.
I'd pay and extra $10 for a game with the original voices.3.
Did "options" offer turning off the parrot's voice?
Terrible graphics!

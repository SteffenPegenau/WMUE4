I also liked the cool indian characters.
If you like boring movies than this is DEFINITLY the one for you.
It has some new characters and some of the same.
I saw this movie at school.
These are teh things that I liked about the movie.
It had a lot of action.I have read the book though.
The video is a lot like the novel.
It doesn't have all the things that movies have these days.
I don't think I would like if I hadn't have read the book.
I also like the cool outdoor setting of the movie.
And thats all i have to sayy about that.
The thing about it is that it's old and not as cool as the new and imporved movies.
Believe i have read the book and seen the movie...
I liked the action and fights that it had in it.
The ending is very exciting.
I wish they were.
Thats why I like the movie.
But some characters that I think were very important went even in the video.
It was okay.

PS.
I dont know why this was not on one of there albums.
I know you will love this.
Jimmy Page was not on the top of his game when some of the stuff was recorded,, but give him a break,, he is the best even when he is not on.
I have heard around 11 versins of this song and well, this is the best.
Give It Back to rock and roll!
I am a really big Zep fan.
I Cant Quit you was great as well.
I really fell in love with this album.
I hate that.
Please by all the Led Zeppelin records that you can, because Maria Carry has sold just a few million records more than Zeppelin.
It was really just a sound check that they were doing before there concert.
It just goes to show you that people dont know where it is at any more.
The song We'er gonna Groove is great.
I can find it on.
It is a shame that this is the only cd.
This is a great album and is a lot of fun to listen to.
Jimmy Page is in my opinon, one of the top 10 guitar players in rock history.

(But seriously, what parents name their kid Jazz?)
It wasn't wonderful or spectacular, in my opinion, but I liked it.
Ashleigh and Christina are kind of too perfect for me.
Perfect Challenge was a very good book.
But still, when Image is around, it's never boring.
Melanie's spunky and determined.
I also like Image.
She was so adorable!
The only complaints I have is that you have to stick with the book because sometimes it gets a little bit dull.
Image is so different from all the other horses in this series, and it's a nice change.
Anyway, the book is a little slow at first, but it picks up and is definitely exciting at the end.
I like Melanie, because she's so different than Ashleigh or Christina.
I adore Baby--Image's tiny friend!
Though Image is DEFINITELY not a Wonder.
Sometimes Image gets me a little frustrated.
I was really happy that Jazz and Melanie were finally together--Jazz is SO nice!

This is probably coming from 30 year old men.
Bottom Line: If you are looking for a fast paced great two-player game.
This is not a perfect game.
Some would say the other flaws are that the solo game is meh and that the game is too easy.
Mr.
Buy it Now.
THis is it.
kids will love this.
THe game actually lets you play with two players at once throughout the entire game.
The main flaw is that it is a short game.
The action puzzles aren't too hard to figure out.
Not unlike lego star wars for two players.
Fantastic is by far more fun to play, but playing as Frozone ain't to shabby.
This is perfect for siblings.
It is light, and very fun.

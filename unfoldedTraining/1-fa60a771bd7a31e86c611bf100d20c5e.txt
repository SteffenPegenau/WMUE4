The guns on its bellt and back are ok, but the trunk get in the line of fire.
Its small.
First mode as seen on the box has guns on its back and a gripping trunk called Commander type.
when i bought this the box was huge.
HUGE.
The zoid wasn't hard to buld, but very small.
Don't buy this zoid if the price is more than $15.
It still has guns on its back, a diffrent head, huge shield ears, and a shield trunk.
There are better zoids.
Its weapons are poor.
Finally the Scouter type with a radar beacon on its back which carries a second pilot, oval radar ears, same head as Fighter-type, and a land radar trunk.
Also the pieces are fragile and snap easily.
It has 3 'modes'.
Dispite all of the types its still not a reccomended toy.
Second is fighter-type.

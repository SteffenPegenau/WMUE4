Some movies benefit from these temporal leaps (Pulp Fiction or Momento) but Alexander does not.
Last, there was some BAD casting.
The director's habit of leaping backward and forward in time was confusing and awkward.
The movie was okay.
The movie itself had moments of greatness, but was too long, too disjointed, and lacked any sort of clarity.
Focus on the film, people!
There was none of the sense of tactics or purpose that characterized battle scenes in Braveheart or Gladiator.
In most battle scenes you simply couldn't tell what was happening.
Nothing more.
All in all, not Oliver Stone's greatest effort.
I, for one, couldn't care less about Alexander's sexual orientation.
Too many reviewers do.
Angelina Jolie as Colin Farrel's mother?
Come on.
Just that.

Will he try to get revenge?
So many questions that makes the appetite of your average movie view grow.
She's gotta be around somewhere!!!
Now that you've brought this classic up to the Y2K era, how about a sequel?
(pretending to fall in love with her only to lead her on).
John Canada Terrell and Tracy Camilla Johns reunited.
Seriously!
Anyway, I saw this movie way back in the day and loved it.
I do believe the 2 of them (JCT and TCJ) sort of have that Billy Dee Williams/Diana Ross connection.
I think you should find Ms. Johns and ask her to do a sequel.
Think about it, Spike.
You'd really do something if you reunited them.Much luv brotha!
Will he still love her or did he get his fill of white girls.
I mean, really!
Spike!
(heck, they even have the same initials) How would Greer feel when he runs into Nola again after 20+ years?
They play well together.

The first show was good, but Addison and Preston Burke are surely missed.
With Addison moving to a spin-off, Burke off the show and how the writers "messed up" George's character (would he really be with 2 women, much less cheat on his wife---that's not him) who could argue with me?
I still believe the show "jumped the shark" this past third season.
I had a hard time watching it.
The writers, in my opinion were ruining the show.
However, when I bought this DVD collection that opinion changed a bit.
Also it helps to not see any commercials.
But this third season, what did they do to us viewers?
The second season was just as good.
I hope this season is better.
Grey's Anatomy is the only TV show that I consistently watch.
I started watching Grey's during the first season and was hooked.
So this is a must for any Grey's Anatomy fan.
If you watch the DVDs they are as advertised, seriously extended and this was what I needed.
I seem to prefer watching movies.

A headache, but it's over.
HUGE.
Seems simple.
Then there's the assembly.
Problem is when you line up all the sides, the holes don't line up wht the stupid pegs!!!
5 simple pieces not counting the lid.
I got my hammer as instructed and began to whack the hell out of the plates dead center.
Bottom line: Best priduct out there, but take deep breaths!
Like I say, excellent product.
Stores a ton of toys.
This company designed there own rectangular shaped plates that have these screw like tips that go into the holes in the walls of the toy chest.
Anyway.
Took me about 10 mins to finish.
Then you realize there's no screws or anything like that.
Despite they don't look lined up, once you whack th plates in the middle, eventually they will fall into place.

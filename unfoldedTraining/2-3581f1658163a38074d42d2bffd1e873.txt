I did not enjoy this movie at all!!
I didn't read the novel.
All in all I guess the action and fight scenes were what made this arguably tolerable but everything else was a major disappointment.
I was told this movie stayed true to the graphic novel.
Which spoke volumes to me.
I was just interested in visual effects and the fact that it was a super hero movie.
Male frontal nudity in several scenes.
!
It seemed compressed to me.2.
I would have liked to know more.
Maybe it did but I wouldn't know.
Lack of a background about the super heroes.
I'd like someone to explain to me how that helped the plot/storyline.I saw this movie with a few friends who are less critical than I am and one of them asked afterwards if this movie warranted a "What The ----?".
So I figured what the heck.
My first clue should have been the fact that it was Rated R. Maybe I am a bit over sensitive but I was turned off by two things:1.

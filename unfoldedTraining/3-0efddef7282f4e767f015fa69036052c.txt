Worth it for that, if you're an aviation buff.
It won't be missed.
Looks like the same India location, the same river, almost the same herds of Elephants (now with their tusks clipped) and Sabu's in the same dhoti style shorts running through the same forested territory.
Jungle Hell does appear to have been heavily edited for this DVD, apparently made for TV use.
If you like Sabu!
Original reviews contain references to a "flying saucer", a popular subject at the time, but it's not in this version.
For Sabu fans.
Compare the two films and enjoy!
It could easily be a sequel to his first pre-war film "Elephant Boy".
The man was ageless in many ways.
Sabu is the star for sure.
Savage Drums is a bit of a pot boiler, but contains some rare footage of a Boeing Stratocruiser.
Excellent transfers.
Buy it!
Jungle Hell is more interesting.

I would have ditched her the first opportunity that I had.
Come on.
I've have read some of Ms. Roberts work and I have enjoyed them.
I really like Doug.
He's rugged, strong and down to earth.
I would not bring a 85$ worth of pants into a rain forest or out walking.
She's constantly writing down his charges in her little account book.
85$ for a pair of pants.
No, I would like a better character than Miss Priss.
This one.
I want to ring the heroine's neck at times.
Doug I would take any day.
Whitney is a spoiled little brat.
Everything has to be her way.
Killers or no killers.
I don't know what he sees in Whitney.
She just rubs me the wrong way.

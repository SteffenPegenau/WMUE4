the phone has hard molded buttons.
what's the point of a fake cell phone for toddlers that has buttons you can't squish?
this one is very no frills.
when they were producing it.
some examples: the cute flower that you see on the front of the purse?
you can't push them in- squish them.
it was as if they said "how can we produce this as cheaply as possible?"
overall, this version looks cute, but, doesn't have that much going for it.
that's their favorite part.
it's only on one side of the bag.
it could be large so no one chokes on it, but, that would have been a bit more fun.
they could have put it on both sides at least for the tactile entertainment of their young customers.
try a different one, if you're asking me.
I love the idea of this toy and I've seen really cute versions.
the wallet has no hinge, it will break off after the kid opens it 5 times.
the fake lipstick tube has no cover.
would it have killed them to put a cover on the lipstick?

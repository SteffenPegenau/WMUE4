They are not uncut.
The show is very jumpy because of the cuts.
This set was a gift.
If you don't mind chopped up episodes, and cheaply done packaging, this set is for you.
The worst of all is the fact that Universal markets these sets as "complete & uncut".
Universal is home of vast numbers of greed merchants.
In the 1970s, commercial breaks did not run 25 minutes for a 2 hour program.
That is common now, but not in the 70s.
In a 2 hour slot, that leaves 25 minutes for commercials.
Universal deserves no one's loyalty.
"Last Salute to the Commodore" is missing more than 10 minutes of footage.
Each of these episodes is heavily cut up.
"Commodore" runs just over 95 minutes.
Otherwise, look at the alternate sets being offered online by other providers.
No artwork on the DVD, no artwork on the inside of the cases.
I was amazed at how cheaply this series is now being produced.
As I said, not in the 70s.

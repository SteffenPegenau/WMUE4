I was six when it came on and the only thing I ever watched on Nickelodeon was Nick at Nite so this show was perfect for me.
And now Hey Dude.
You guys are great.
Then you make all my dreams come true by releasing the remainder of Dragnet.
I loved this show when I was a kid.
I remember hating Brad and thinking she was very unatttactive.
So after watching one episode and not really liking it like I used to she kept me watching and I rediscovered after 22 years just how good this show was.
Again thank you Shout.
First you release Designing Women and make me very happy.
I guess I'm not sure.
Why?
Yeah Im a guy but I don't care I love those chicks.
Kelly Brown (Brad) is smoking hot.
Can't wait for future seasons to be released.
First of all thank you Shout Factory.
Yay!!!
Boy was I wrong.
Mr Ernst was my favorite character.

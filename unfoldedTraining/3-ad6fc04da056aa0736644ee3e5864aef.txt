But forget it if you're not.
If you're in the same room, it would work.
Imagine the weakest battery-operated digital alarm clock you can imagine.
They should have put more thought into the, er, "alarm."
I read others' reviews here and decided to try it anyway.
It's far from ideal, but not total crap.
The light is pretty bright.
Mine is in the garage in an outlet with a side-by-side refrigerator/freezer.
Little tiny beeps.
But since we're in and out of the garage many times a day, we'll catch a power outtage within 12 hours or so... and this will be heard as soon as we open the door.
For something that's supposed to alert you to something as important as an electrical failure, this isn't very "ALARMING."
Almost like from one of those LED alarm wristwatches!
Can't hear it at all inside the house... even right outside the door.
Well, they were right.
I tested it.
That's the sound.

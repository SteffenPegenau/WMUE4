I am a hugh John Denver fan.
Try his "Spirit" album, or his "I Want To Live" album.
However, if you are looking for a inspiring, uplifting John Denver album this one is not for you.
I bought the CD to make my collection complete.
With these recordings you can't go wrong.
I agree with the last reviewer.
I believe the year was 1977.
Although, I try to look for positive messages in all of John's music, and there is some positve messages here for it's time.
I bought this album many years ago.
It is too dark and gloomy.
Until I played this one.
They truly are, "FAR OUT"!
I had heard several other albums by John at this time in my life and loved everything about his music.
I like to think of John as a positve and uplifting singer/song writer.
I don't believe the ocassional John Denver listener will enjoy this recording as much as some later recordings.

I hope you listen to this review.
The action scenes are terrible.
This isn't a comedy.
If you want manga with beautiful art, try The Tarot Cafe.
One of the genres is romance.
The main character is pathetic.
If you want romance, try Dramacon.
The romance is badly written.
Please, do not buy this garbage.
You won't laugh at all.
If you want comedy, try Popo Can.
If you want action, try Fullmetal Alchemist.
She is such a wimp.
This is the most boring manga ever.
The art is pretty bad.

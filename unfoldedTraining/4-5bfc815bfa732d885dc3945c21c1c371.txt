Why?
Would you eventually go crazy?
It has so many elements that are so perfectly suited for Murray and his comedic style.
When this movie first came out I saw it twice.
Well, whatever the reason, I can assure you of this, it is not because this is a bad movie.
Would you use your knowledge to take advantage of the situation?
I should, because I stop and watch it whenever it's on TV.
Well, pick up this movie and see what Bill Murray did with it.
You won't be sorry.
Then again, maybe that's why I don't own it.
What would you so if you had to relive the same day over and over.
Or would you use the time to better yourself?
I have no idea.
I have to admit I do not own this particular DVD.
Since it's release it has been copied many, many times, but it has never been duplicated.

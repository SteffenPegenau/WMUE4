um..I dont even need to say what is good and what isnt but..''creepign death'' SUCKZZ!!!!
'FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE''..O yes what an opener!!!
also Mustiane was METALLICA I think!!

What a MIXED BAG!!!!!!!
and ''for whom..''..it's ok, NOTHING GREAT!
!And also..ATTETION 13yr old kid's, will you PLEASE look up N.W.O.B.H.M.
I HATE THAT SONG!!

''fade to black''..well the ending is really BEAUTIFUL, but CANDLEMASS will always SLAY this song, CANDLEMASS INFLUENCED this song as well!!
!I think ''escape'' is my fave song on here, it's simple and I like the lyric's!!!

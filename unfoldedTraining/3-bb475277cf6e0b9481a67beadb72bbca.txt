I give it an average rating as I will put five or six of these on my iPod.
Somebody kick him in the Ass.
I'd like to hear more from Molland still.
But I can't understand how he can go from the insanely great Badfinger tracks to stuff as poorly put together as this.
His singing is very bad and it detracts.
Why doesn't he hire someone?
Gargle with some salt water, Joe.
Several songs could be real good but someone else should sing them.
This cat needs a real producer.
The guitar work was more inspiring on The Pilgrim, too.
He still writes very good pop-rock.
Is his voice really that deteriorated?
I Iiked Molland's Badfinger material and bought this after purchasing the pretty decent Pilgrim CD.
No pun intended.
You still write a good tune.

There was alot more hair on the floor than usual.
Needless to say, I am running out today to buy a new hairdryer.
Because of the burning smell, I know the hairdryer is to blame rather than a medical condition or something else environmental.
I noticed that there were actual clumps of hair that had fallen out---including the root.
The dryer did not feel overly hot so I wasn't sure what happend.
Do yourself a favor and purchase a different hair dryer.
They smelled like burning hair.
There were sections that had 10 hairs clumped together by the burned root.
I was scared.
The last time I used it, I noticed the general smell of burning hair when I was done.
The next thing I noticed was the floor of my bathroom.
For the first two months of owning this hair dryer, it did a fine job.
Upon closer inspection, I felt sick to my stomach.
Nothing out of the ordinary--dried my hair just fine.
I am not sure if I got a dud one or not but my experience goes like this.

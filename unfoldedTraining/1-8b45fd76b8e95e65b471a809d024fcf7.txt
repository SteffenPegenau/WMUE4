He doesn't discriminate anyone, he is peace loving!
All other artists can't even dare of thinkin of competing with him!!!
Benzino go ---- yourself!!!
Since he is half white and half black he doesn't say anything against the white race especially and thinks that hip-hop is open to everyone even to white people!!
BULLSH**!!!!!!!!
Even doesn't diss any other rappers, especially Eminem!
and ur mag too!!
!
This album is a masterpiece, a classic, lyrics which make me faint with their deepness!
this is a bunch of cliche lyrics put together to get some quick bucks by dissin someone who's talented not like u!!
Oh My God!!
if hip-hop was u....man this ain't music!
By the way i didn't buy the album i just borrowed it so i'm not dissappointed that i gave you some of my cash!
Benzino is the most creative Hip-Hop artist ever!
u're makin hip-hop look stupid!

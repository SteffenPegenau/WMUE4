I am guessing that by now you know that it takes a very, very special CD to rate being reviewed by me.
Well here is one that literally knocked my socks off when I played it.
This will be evidenced on the one instrumental offering on the CD.
One sensational track followed by another.
The sound is THERE!!
Doing a couple of oldies and a load of originally written tunes.
Along with his vocal abilities, he plays one Great guitar.
Well you won't be sitting still!
Listening to James and I find no problem at all picturing him with the likes of Little Isidore & Little Leopold.
Average maybe, one in every 20 is reviewed.
Hi All!
I know you will feel the same as I do when you sit and listen to James Hunter.
All vocals are by James Hunter.
James Hunter a young German National has captured the essence of the 50's & early 60's Rock and Rhythm & Blues.

Did I say SIT??

Then noticed the charger slowly melting above the red charge light.
No joke people!, this item is a fire hazzard please do not buy!!
Started gettin hot (like the original carger) didn't think much of it.
I'm taking it and buying a new drill unfortunatly.
Goto black n decker if anything.
If already did please do not leave charger unattended!
Was phyched because I've been without a charger for awhile, plugged in and started charging.
Fire!
This thing is garbage!!
Then poof!!
Will catch on fire.
I strongly advise not buying.
!
Just received it today.
Its crap!!!

That's about it.
Mildly gruesome.
When crucial plot points were revealed, I'd already figured out the puzzle, and I'm not one to figure things out ahead of time unless they're pretty obvious.
The story(ies) arc tries hard to be mysterious by purposefully obscuring details.
The tale comes together slowly, in a disappointing, anti-climatic manner.
It's just drawn out closure on top of more drawn out closure.
It doesn't feel mysterious.
For all of its' oh-so-clever presentation, Boogiepop is a lot of sick and shimmer with no substance.
It feels unorganized.
The final disc is pointless and adds nothing to the story.
The magical light also allows dangerous creatures into the world who collide and hide in people.
Not for kids.
Three-ish stars.
The world is not ready for them.
Boogiepop Phantom's 12 episodes of scattered narratives, and darting time lines, center around a magical beam of light that turns humans into hybrid creatures of the future who cannot exist on this plane.

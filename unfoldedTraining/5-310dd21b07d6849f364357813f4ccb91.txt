(Her name is nowhere to be found on the credits - at least not on the VHS I purchased.)
Sidney and Abbey are FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY in "For Love of Ivy."
I was first introduced to Abbey Lincoln through film.
She sang the opening and closing theme song to "For Love of Ivy."
I play them again and again.
Lyrics that had/have significance - then and now.
I have in my collection "For Love of Ivy" in which she co-stars with Sidney Poitier.
Shirley Horn - may she rest in peace - is another forgotten notable, as well.
(Check them out.
Also, "Nothing But a Man" in which she co-stars with Ivan Dixon.
If you like jazz, check out the listening samples and add "Abbey is Blue" to your shopping cart.
The films are timeless pieces.
Broaden your musical palate.
Smooth, controlled flexible, melodic tones.
)I knew Abbey sang BUT I didn't know how WELL she sang.

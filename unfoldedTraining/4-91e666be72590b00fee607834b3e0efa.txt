The Left Behind Movie was anything but a disappointment!Admittedly the film did have a small budget and a huge challenge in doing the book series justice as an adaptation.
Then again the whole project was gutsy.
But no more than most people would give to any budget challenged independent film.As for the "video-before-theatrical" release concept?
I plan on bringing a ton of friends and I hope you do too!
It almost hurt to put the DVD in the machine.
All things considered Cloud Ten did a great job.
Absolutely...
Sure, a little.
Can you say "Omega Code"?
Because the "Christian" themed movies that I have sampled in the past have mostly been disappointments.
Very gutsy.
Will I go and see it again in the theatre in February?
I wanted so badly for the movie to be good.
Am I cutting the film some critical slack because I badly want it to win?
Even passable would have been ok. Why?

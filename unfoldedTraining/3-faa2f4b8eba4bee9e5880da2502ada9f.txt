There's nothing limited about it.
This is not the Limited Edition.
Go back to the search and just get the regular Path of Neo for XBox for $5.00, because that's what this is.
?Get the game.
the $5.00 is brand new.
How's that for misleading?
THIS IS NOT THE LIMITED EDITION!
Okay, first off, I'd like to say that I do like this game.
And the other thing.
This is also used.
DON'T BUY THIS VERSION FROM THIS SELLER!
BUT FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, DON'T GET IT FROM THIS SELLER!
It's a lot of fun.
It's not great, and it's not the best game ever made, but it's still fun.That being said, this is a rant on the seller.
Oh yeah.

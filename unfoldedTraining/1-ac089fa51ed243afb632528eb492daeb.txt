The good news is that they are thin as a undershirt should be.
They were tiny.
The length of the sleeve underarm, in a size large, was 2 1/2 inches.I took them back and bought some Hanes.
Wow.
Either there was carnival prize t-shirt shrinkage or they came off of the kid's line-up initially.
They fit like they should, and had another two inches in under-sleeve length.
Washed and dried them the same way.
Then I tried them on.
I seldom post reviews, but I have to now.
They were so tiny I actually measured.
I washed in the warm/cold combo, dried them only to damp, and hung them to complete drying.
The bad news is that that they are useless.
I purchased these because I wanted the "thinner" "undershirt" (see prior discussions on these topics).
Huge difference in quality.Beware the Fruit on this one.
I bought a package and sent them to the washer.

First slowly bringing the litter box to the bathroom, raising it up to the toilet, and finally replacing the box on the toilet with kitty litter in plastic wrap.
But kitty was not happy.
The thrid day she peed ON OUR BED!
It waists your time and annoys the pig."
Neither of our two cats used the toilet.
The second day she pooped.
The first day sans box she peed on the floor in front of the toilet.
So, the kitty box returned and we have had no further straying of toilet duties.The book is cute and entertaining.
Not me.
I spent nearly 2 months follwing the instructions in this book.
This, my friend, was a cat telling us she was not happy with the situation.
Now, I have a cat that hangs over the edge of her litter box so I though this would not be a leap.
There's an old saying: "Never try to teach a pig to sing.
Maybe you have a cat that will use the toilet.
Now replace pig with cat and sing with use the toilet.

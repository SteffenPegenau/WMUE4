And Jack, does he get a girl?
What of Lydia and Hannah?
I enjoyed the story and the characters.
It is a wonderful mini-series!
It is more like a t.v.
I bought this dvd sight unseen after reading so many great reviews and I am not sorry that I did.
I want to know more!
Is Matty pregnant????
I enjoyed it so much that I sat there for the whole 8 1/2 hours (excluding the 5 minute breaks here and there) to watch the entire series!
I wanted to know more and now I am stuck still wanting to know more.This is a very good movie with likeable and attractive characters, good story lines and believable events!
I highly encourage anyone who likes perdiod mini-series films to watch this one.
What I don't understand is why it stopped!
All very catchy.
I couldn't stop.
mini-series than a movie type of mini-series though so be prepared to take it slow throughout and want more at the end!

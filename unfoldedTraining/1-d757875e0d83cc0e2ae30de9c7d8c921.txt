Hard to salvage a pot of warm fat laden fry's!!!
I have had other DeLonghi products and been happy, but 3 of 4 of this model died, and 1 other model died.
!
If it would not die it would be a great product; however, not worth the agrivation.
Electronics died and I couldn't find the same unit so I purchased a D14427DZ (same unit with digital temp control).
Wrong!!!
Got another.
On number 4 of this model.
It died too.
Loved it.
Problem solved.
Got this unit.
Thought great, the digital temp was replaced with analog.
Same fate.
I had a DeLonghi fryer with a rotating basket.
Electronics died.

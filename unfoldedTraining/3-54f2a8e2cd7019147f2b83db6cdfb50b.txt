I still recommend PFS to all science fiction fans...
Step 2- Hire unknowns.
I like the idea of an alien who is just trying to survive on our planet, without wanting to destroy us.
Nothing spectacular, but enjoyable enough.
It's an average little movie with a decent storyline.
He tries to make contact, but ends up scaring people instead.

There are some lengthy patches of boredom and silliness throughout.
This is by no means a perfect movie.
Actually, I happen to like PHANTOM FROM SPACE just fine.
Step 1- Make the alien invader invisible, so you only need to show doors opening and closing, and furniture moving around to indicate the extra-terrestrial presence.
He kills in self-defense, only to be branded a murderer.
Step 3- Stock footage!
He's stranded here with no way to communicate with our species!

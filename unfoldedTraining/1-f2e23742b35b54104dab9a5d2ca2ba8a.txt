I'm getting a great Mountain Hardwear ten to replace it.
The seams near the bottom are below the rain fly.
We woke up the first night to standing water inside the tent.
I packed it up and sent it back to Campmor where I bought it.
Maybe I just got a bad one.
I've always liked Coleman.
They refunded the tent and the shipping.
We bought this tent last summer and used it one beautiful sunny weekend.
Totally loved the tent.
We had to cover the tent with a tarp and one of our freestanding canopies so we could make it through the trip.
It was bad!
We used it a couple of months later on a not so nice weekend.
water literally poured in along the seam.
All our clothes were wet, our sleeping bags were wet.
But I'll never rick it again.
It rained most of the 3 days and nights.
We got very, very wet.
Even with this extra covering, it still leaked in at the few points we couldn't get secondary cover over.
It was great!

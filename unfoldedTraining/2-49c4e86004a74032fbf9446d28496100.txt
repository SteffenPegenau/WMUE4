Book is big but only fair.
But even the text about Bouguereau is more profound than what is here.
And all his body parts are beautifully rendered.
The photos -- none are really titillating, if that's what you're after.
But Waterhouse's women always have the same androgonous hard unfriendly faces.
If lots of mood, but unpleasant faces is OK, Waterhouse gives you plenty of mood.
Bouguereau also gives mood but in a greater variety.
(I reviewed one.)
Bouguereau has more variety than Waterhouse very pretty faces as well as other parts.
See books (there are only a couple) about him.
The best art -- clothed or nude -- of this type is Bougeureau.
A lot of text -- somewhat interesting, but not profoundly so.
If you want lots and lots of text, this book is fine.
Even if all you want are titillating nudes, you are more likely to find it with Bouguereau than in this book.
Waterhouse is also good.

Even slower than the kid's.
I had great expectations.
Oh, and I forgot to mention, and one point, while shifting, the chain slipped off.
Took about an hour.
It corrected itself, but I had to pull over.
The assembly wasn't difficult, but not entirely simple either.
I pedaled faster, and the bike makes minimal advance.
I've had the bike (female) for three weeks.
I thought the bike was unusually slow and the auto-shift is loud and rough.
My bike was the slowest!
I regretfully say, I'm not pleased with the bike's performance.
Then yesterday, I participated in a community bike ride.
Although I wasn't pleased with the phone order process, follow-up conversations with Customer Service were good.
The shifting is convenient, but doesn't make up for the bike's performance.
It's a shame I'm going to lose the shipping cost, because I paid that much for my old bike and I prefer it to the Landrider.

A good read but know what you are getting.
This book involves an *extremely* small amount of magic.
It's the standard definition of 'high fantasy'.
As has been pointed out, this is *slightly* fictionalized medieval history.
It's a tale of intrigue and kingdoms and warfare.
Hardly.
Humans.
So if you are expecting anything comparable to Tolkien-esque 'high fantasy' (true high fantasy), look for another series.
I cringe when I read descriptions of this series as "high fantasy".
Miniscule.
This book has one race.
This book has dragons in it that are eggs until the 2nd book and immature and unimportant even in the third book.
Fantasy?
I enjoyed this book a great deal as I enjoy all things medieval, yet this book (and this whole series in fact) is hardly fantasy.
Dragons may become more prominent in the 4th and 5th books (soon to come).
High fantasy usually involves elves, dwarves, wizards, gnomes, magic, etc.

We still have not competed putting it together.
Hopefully when time permits, all will go smoothly.
The instuctions stated that it would take 30 min.
Again another call to the company who then was to send the correct part.
After waiting for delivery we found they had sent the wrong size part.
he finally when to a store to try and puchase the part that was the correct size.
Then my husband found that the instructions stated one thing but the picture showed something else.
Another call etc.
A telephone call to the company helped.
It took a long time just to be able to identify the different pieces.
The directions neglected to name each item, and since we are new at this and not familiar with everything it took some guess work.
We Hope!
to put together.
This has not turned out as stated.
After continuing to install some more of the pieces he found that one of them was incorrect.
My children and I bought this for my husband who was very excited in receiving it.

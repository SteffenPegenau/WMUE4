Paul out does himself and give so much.
AND GET BACK!
I love how the camera roves through the audience and you see the emotional responses from the fans.
His band is phenominal and you can tell they are fans and put their heart into the playing.
GET IT!
Tears, smiles, and just good 'ole boogying!
What a DVD!
Seriously, this is one of the best and most emotional rock performances I have ever seen!
It is flawless and the harmonies are sublime.
There are some incredible moments.
Not one of my favs from Pepper, but live it takes on a whole new dimension!
Another that totally left me in awe was She's Leaving Home!
Fantastic.
The back-up harmonies echo The Beatles...all in all a can't miss DVD!
Another classic that sounds so much better was Let Em In!
It also must be said that Paul's voice is the best I have heard live!
I've Got a Feeling is so raw and Paul plays some great licks on the electric.

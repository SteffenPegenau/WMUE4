It doesn't handle the listed volume at all.
I just replaced it with the Fellowes C-120C.
But be sure to oil it OFTEN!
I am an individual active realtor working from home and have a lot of things to shred.
I just received it today and am really impressed with the difference.
I oil it very often with canola oil (per the instruction manual) at least every time I empty the receptacle bin.
Also, you can't run it for more that about 10 minutes continuously without it shutting itself down for at least 20 minutes to cool down.
But it still jams very frequently.
!
I have owned one of these shredders for about a year.
You can only really put 2 or 3 sheets through at a time, and it still jams often.
The PS80C-2 is probably fine if you don't do much volume.
The design is very convenient, and it fits very conveniently under a desk.
I have gotten the tweezers out for the last time on this shredder!
It has proved to be totally inadequate for my needs.

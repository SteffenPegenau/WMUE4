possibly finer than I wanted.
Ack!
I hate it when a grinder loosens as I am using it and I end up with cracked peppercorns in my lovely Alfredo sauce.
Getting you a coarser grind.
Now, which of you is the green pepper.........hmmm...
So, flip the thing over and watch the grinder as you "tighten" it.
If I could see through them!
I absolutely love these grinders!
I have 5 different kinds of peppercorns separated into their own grinders.
The thing that would make them better?
I went searching for them.
With a couple of twists, I have coarse pepper!
Lovely rubbed onto a steak!
More space means bigger pepper!
This means as I use it and the screw loosens it drops the burr grinder and I end up with a finer grind.
If you tighten the screw clockwise, it lifts the burr grinder away from the stationary ring.
My father has some and I love the way it tightens "backward".
Easily remedied!

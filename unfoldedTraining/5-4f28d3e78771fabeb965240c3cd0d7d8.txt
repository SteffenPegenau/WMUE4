Originally, thought I wanted a laptop cooler with fans, but based on reviews it didnt sound like they are all they are cracked up to be.
The aluminum stand apparently does pull heat away from the computer and helps cool the machine.
LOVE IT!
All in all, this is a great product.
The Mac itself is staying cooler.
I shopped a lot of them.
I finally decidd on the iLap stand by Rain Design.
I recently purchased my first Mac, a MacBook Pro.
So, next I wanted a laptop cooler or platform for laptop use.
A little pricey, but worth it.
The padded wrist rest is comfortable and protects from the sharp corner edge on the MacBook Pro (one thing I dont like about the MacBook Pro).
It came today and oh man, it's great.
I feel confident you will be pleased too.
The stand is comfortable on my lap and it keeps my legs cool while working.
I'm going to order one for my wife now.
I've been using it all afternoon with my new Mac.

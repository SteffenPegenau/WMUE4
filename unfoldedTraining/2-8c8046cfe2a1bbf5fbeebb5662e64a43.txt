The numbers are easy to read, but not the date.I love shopping with Amazon, return shipping is free and easy.
When I tap on the face it has that plastic sound.
So we are returning it to Amazon.
Initially, she liked it.
She and I both have trouble reading the date with our glasses on.
I almost returned it without showing it to her, as I thought it looked smaller than advertised, and not very sturdy.
Also, the Easy Reader's date is not so easy to read.
My wife has a physical job, and we don't think it would hold up.
She wore it for a day and said the band was uncomfortable.
It is very lightweight.
I thought the whole thing was plastic, but they claim the bezel is metal.
I bought this watch for my wife.
It doesn't seem able to withstand any abuse.
If your looking for a sturdy, comfortable watch, this is not it.
It is miniscule.

The characters don't have any emotion.
This is definitely not X Files or Star Trek.
But that will make Fringe another X Files and Star Trek show.two stars from me.
Every episodes are similar.
It maybe nice if they give ET a bigger role to understand what make us human even in a parallel universe.
It is slow.
But again, after the first season, I just don't care anymore.
*Spoiler*I like the idea that we are having a war between our parallel universe.
It doesn't make you think or connect.
The show lacks content.
I also like the idea that ET is watching.
Spoiler Alert!I watched Fringe every week and bought the DVD set.Fringe is just not that good.
Something happens, let's go see what is going on.
The show has very little philosophical or psychological value.
After the first season, I lost interest.

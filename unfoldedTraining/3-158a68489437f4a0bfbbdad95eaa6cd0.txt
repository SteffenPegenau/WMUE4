The children were not realistic.
No offense.
In one chapter she's all mean and spoiled.
Jakob seemed so harsh.
And in the next, she's feeeling bad for eavesdropping.
Some characters seemed to be crying every other page.
But I've definitly read better books.
Charlotte is a character hard to understand.
And it was hard to read because she kept throwing in all these German words.
This book was okay, but isn't one of my favorites.
He always seemed to be upset.
Overall, this book wasn't bad.
They seemed too perfect.
And I felt sorry for Lance.
He was in love with such a loser.

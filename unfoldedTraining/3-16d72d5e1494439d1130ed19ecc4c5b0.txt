It sounds very contrived and not a whole lot like actual music.
Its very randon.
However, It is worth buying if your into this kind of stuff.
Bryan Black sings, and a different person from another band did the music.
Of course its produced and engineered by Martin Atkins, he's a genius.
I know a lot about Industrial music, and this is a strange cd.
I like it.
The cd has no real direction.
It could be much better.
In other words, this album is lost.
It has great beats and sounds, but it doesn't fit together very well.
Which is pretty much what this cd is.
The sound is crisp and clear.
Many tallented people worked on it like Ray Watts, but it doesn't sound like they put their best effort into it.
Just don't expect anything spectacular.................
It sounds like a whole bunch of different people got together and did their own thing and left it at that.

How about the penalty system?
How many hunters run through the woods with an X-ray machine?
If you stand in the woods too long, you apparently just die.
And, how about the X-ray mode?
Save your money, you're better off waiting for a different hunting game to come out.
You see, I bought this game and I still regret it.
The creaters didn't put any effort into it.
In this game, the game animals have little flourescant red dots on them, so you can go run up to them and shoot them.
You immediatly get a fine from the warden(somehow, he manages to just pop up when you blast a squirrel.
This game is one of the worst games I've played.
How realistic is it when you follow little orange dots?
It has [bad] graphics, it's slow, not realistic, and boring.
And sometimes if you wound a bear, it'll run away.
Please, people, this is a new game.
You also have a health meter.

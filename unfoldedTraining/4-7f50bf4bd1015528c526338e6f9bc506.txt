So I bought it, and had to wait to play.
This past Christmas, he saw the add for the Diamond edition.
Researched it, and didn't like the fact that it folded and didn't snap shut.
When we bought our first house, I bought a small cheap set to "get us started".
The tiles are a really nice black wood and silver writing(not plastic like I've seen noted).
And the timer is always a nice threat when someone is taking too long.
Now we can keep things on permanent record!
I love the fact that the tiles stay in place (everything is nice and lined up!!
We always used a legal pad.
), and it turns so nicely.
Then I saw this one.
Loved it!
Once we did play, it was great.
Our only problem is that it is a pretty big box, and had to make a little room to store it.
My husband loves scrabble.
He's always won.
I also love the score keeper.
I love how clean and simple it is.

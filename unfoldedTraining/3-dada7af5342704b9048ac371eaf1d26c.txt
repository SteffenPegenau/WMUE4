I understand the African part.
I'm just giving it a forewarning.
What's with all the techno?The first track is awesome.
Before you buy this album, ask yourself, "Do I like techno?"
First time I heard of Afro Celt, it sounded like a great concept.
And that is this.
I'll give them that.
However, lot's of people are loving them, and as a music fan I have to give them credit for that.
After that it's a slow decent downhill.
I understand the Celtic part.
Perhaps they've gone more the way of the first track on other albums.
They described themselves as African beats with Celtic melodies.
There were on CNN being interviewed at a World Music festival.
Repeditive, club-like techno.Personally, I hope they get a little more melodic and less techno.
And not just techno.
I can hope.I'm not saying this album is bad.

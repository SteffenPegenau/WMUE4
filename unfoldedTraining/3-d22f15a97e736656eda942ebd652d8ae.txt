Chris Rock is okay, but just doesn't seem to fit.
The usual.
They could've used him to a much better effect.
This is, without a doubt, the weakest entry in the very popular and successful series.
He is more annoying than anything else.
It's been six years since we last saw Riggs and Murtaugh and, fortunatley for us, nothing much has changed.
Do we really want it too?.
Joe Pesci is back to bring even more comedic relief.
The plot is paper thin and isn't too interesting to really care about.
The action scenes are great, as usual, and are lots of fun.
It's Mel and Danny who, as always, are the only captivating presences in the film.
He had nothing much to go with here and didn't really need much acting to do.
Jet Li, as the main bad guy, has impressive martial art skills, but has little else to offer.
Just as this movie was the weakest entry in the series, Jet Li's villain was the weakest one in the series as well.
For fans only.

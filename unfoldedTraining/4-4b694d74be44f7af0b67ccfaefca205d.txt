but don't let that stop you.
All the renditions of classic Mancini tunes do justice.
Combines jazz influences with surf, noise, rock, etc.
Enjoy!
But there's not much of a musical resemblance.
Exciting at times, melodic too.
Check out "A Shot in the Dark" and "Mr. Yunoshi" for fast paced stuff, but there's variety.
A fun CD, unabashedly cheesey at times (Peter Gunn meets Baby Elephant Walk for the finale.
Check this out.

Plus, one of the band members is Dave Brubeck's son!
Hilarious and entertaining).
Think Jazz meets Laika and the Cosmonauts meets Morphine.
Great disc.
Only problem: on one or two songs they indulge in Sonic-Youth-esque noise that distract the listener from the overall song.

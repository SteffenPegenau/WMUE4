It is phenomenal and simple!
Upon receiving the video, I watched both discs and was pretty disappointed.
Overall, the video is slow, but it is gentle, effective, and in some ways unique.
Good buy!
But my favorite part?
Still, I tried the exercise disc anyway... and WOW!!!
That's gotta count for something!
Furthermore, the abs section was simply breathing!!
I thought "Most of these exercises are done in a chair.
How is this going to do anything?"
I felt an improvement in my posture as well.
My upper back and shoulders were sore for the whole week, but I felt stronger.
The day after I did the video for the first time, three people told me I looked much thinner.
Not to mention, typically I hate using resistance bands.
I saw and felt a difference immediately.
I am a twenty-two year old, and in decent shape.
The ab routine!
I was surprised.
I bought this DVD because I have always had a weak upper back and shoulders and thought this might do the trick.

Also, did Clift really dig that hole himself that his Pruitt character is forced to dig as punishment?
Her dance hall girl character is sexy and appealing.
I love Donna Reed especially in this movie.
The real thing again?
And what about Clift's violent fight scene with John Dennis?
Is that really his captain/her husbandLancaster sees coming while him and Kerr are listening to the excellent Hawaiin band?
In the fight scene between him and Borgnine in the alley did they use real switchblades?
Lancaster is brilliant to watch as always.
If so boy are most method actors crazy.As for the rest of the film well it is believable enough.
If it did the scene the scene takes on a real life significance in a bad way.
Some vagueness here and there.
Method actors insist on doing the real thing so much while making movies it's hard to say.
I love the Pearl Harbor attack.
Very believable in the way it is handled.
We aren't sure.
It could just be a guy that looks like her husband.

This show has only one good song: Try to Remember.
Huh?
The Arizona scenery is kind of nice.
Where did they dig up this guy?
The other songs are the worst show tunes you will ever hear.
I hope to NEVER see him again.
S. This one deserves NO STARS!
Boring!
A complete and utter stinker.
The clue should be titles like Plant A Radish and The Rape Song.
Avoid this one like the plague.P.
Something vague happens to them and they wind up together.
The cast is dismal.
There really isn't a plot: two fathers pretend to have a feud so that their children will get together romantically.
Totally lacking in charm.
It is sad to see a talented performer like Joel Grey completely wasted in a production this pathetic.
Joe McIntyre has no appeal whatsoever.
The children get together but immediately begin fighting.

Finally, the instructor is encouraging.
I also feel that her routines are pretty easy to pick up.
You may like it.
Give it a try.
She appears to enjoy the workouts as she does them.
You will feel the resistance as if you were using actual weights.
This is a great way to get some strength training in especially if you haven't been active for awhile.
Also, you can easily target areas that you may consider your problem areas.
I like that the sessions are done in 10 minute increments.
It is very effective.
Nothing painful.
More like the burn that you hear instructors speak of.
Another plus is that the DVD comes with a band and you can use that instead of purchasing weights.
This way you can break your routine up based on how busy your daily schedule is.
Bet you're thinking "how effective is a band".
I normally watch exercise workouts at least once to get an idea of what I will be doing.
I always feel my muscles tightening as I do the workouts.

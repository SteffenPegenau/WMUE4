What happened to Keri Russell?
Did the original series really end with George pecking at his typewriter?
Did I turn my head to look at something else in the room and miss it somehow?
For instance, why did the mountain man Wheeler leave the love of his life, his Indian wife, for what looked like fifteen years?
What a mess.
I found this DVD collection extremely frustrating.
Later I read on line that the set had been edited for use in the classroom.
Does anyone know where or how I can see the full version that was on TV?
Huge gaps that leave the viewer in a state of total confusion.
Why didn't he know where she was?
Good characters and acting, but the worse editing I have ever seen.
Why would these people imagine that tatters make a good school lesson?
That seemed to be a weak, bleak ending leaving him there at the school with the maniacal master.
Whoever did this took a great story and reduced it to tatters.
I heard that she married an Indian chief, but why didn't I see that?

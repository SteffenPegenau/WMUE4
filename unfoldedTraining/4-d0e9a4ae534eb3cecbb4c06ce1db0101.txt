About 5 months ago, the batteries died.
Here's where it looses stars.
I bought new ones at Radio Shack (possibly part of the problem...) and it worked great.. for about a month.
However, when my wife wanted to do some calculations, the non-RPNness was perfect for her.
I've used my current 20S for years.
It's just what I want.
I'm getting my second 20S now.
It was at that point, I thought I'd find a better calculator.
I bought another set, it got me another month.
When I first bought it, I was not too happy about not having RPN.
OK.
I tried to order the 32ii but I got too impatient for the 1-2 week wait that quickly doubled.
It's been great for those incidental computations.
As a programmer, I can get most of what I want from the computer itself.
But for things like HEX->DEC, DEC->HEX, etc conversions, this one has been great.

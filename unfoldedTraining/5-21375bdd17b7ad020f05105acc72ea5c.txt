I've been listening to this for years and am really glad to see it remastered.
The best alt country done by real southern folks.
I can't pick a standout song on this because they are all outstanding!
Lots of variety here too.
Excellent lyrically and musically.
This album is a true classic!!!
Bonus tracks too.
I've been waiting and checking.
Even better with the remastering!
Incredible tone and taste.
This is great straight through.
Tunes that will stick in your head without being hook-laden.
Carrie Hudson's guitar playing is sweet, and powerful when need be.
I think it makes a difference.
The old copy I have has been played to death.
If you ever get a chance to see them live you are in for an unforgettable night.

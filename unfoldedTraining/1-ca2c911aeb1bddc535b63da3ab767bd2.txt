Why can't they think of there own game titles????
!
And they will.
And Max payne.
So they think xbox will be more succesful with san andreas.
If sony hadn't sold all those games to xbox, xbox would be down in the dirt where it should be unless you wanted to pay $180 just to play Halo.
But the "respect" belongs to Sony.
Xbox had also done this with the grand theft auto double pack.
Now xbox is making GTAsan andreas for xbox!!
Halo is the only game title for xbox that is really succesful.
All microsoft cares about is making money.
I'm 15 and I can not tell you how pissed off i am at microsoft xbox.
If you want a good honest system that cares about making decent products, I'll tell you one thing, DON'T BUY XBOX!!!!!
Though i do not have a clue why sony sold their best game to xbox.
The next generation game systems should be Gamecube and Ps2.

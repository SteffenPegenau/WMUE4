I do owe Jim Patterson much credit for my new passion for reading.
I enjoyed it.
I really don't understand the entire product placement inserts (M&M's, Nellie, Mountain Dew etc.)
While taking care of my ill mother, I began reading to deal with some insomnia I was having.

I read When the Wind Blows and admit...
it was painful.
Oh God Help Me!
He should end the series here.
This was such a bad read.
From there, went on to read all the Dan Brown books and some Grishim offerings.

Someone should have told him kids today simply don't act nor speak the way they do in this book.
In fact, parts of this book don't seem like Patterson wrote it at all.
I decided to give the Lake House a try thinking it might be fun to revisit the bird clan.

Amazon needs to take this "bonus disc" out of their description.Also the DVD box says follow the Bengals through training camp...?
No disc.
Amazon sent me another DVD, again no bons disc.
Makes the game go very fast!A Bengals fan should still buy it to re-live what was a pretty positive season.
This DVD is just what the title says.
is omitted.
How often have the Bengals gone 6-0 in their division!!
Three of the best games from the Bengals 2009 AFC North Championship season.
Who Dey!
Wrong!
I complained.
Every play from these three games are included.
Nothing more.Amazon says it includes a 5+ hour bonus disc of the 2009 HBO's Hard Knocks season.
None of that footage is included either.Still, the games are great.
No commercials and most of the time between plays (huddles, etc.)

But it is simply not her best.
Every song on the CD is slow, slow, slow.
Not this time.
I really enjoyed all of Diana Krall's previous CD's.
Diana's CDs are fun to listen to.
The CD just drags.
So it was with great anticipation, I bought this CD.
They are also probably the peppiest songs on the CD.
I love a torchy ballad and Diana's sultry voice is perfect for them.
They are just alike, one after the other.
But here, they go from slower to slowest.
Own them all.
Don't play this CD while driving, you'll fall asleep at the wheel.
Try again, Diana.
"Besame Mucho" and "Cry Me a River" are the best songs on the CD.

It's dated, one might say.
I like John Littel, the son, for loving his mother so and for (the idea of) writing this book.
And Mary does get the last laugh re her friend-in-the-park, but I don't want to give it away.
His constantly telling her how stupid, slow-witted, and ineffective she was -- and her skipping over it -- drove me nuts.
I have been to Montpellier; it was wonderful visiting it again.
But I suffered for this woman, and her inability to ask for and obtain any parenting help at all.
But, I don't think so.
And I found myself so annoyed at the husband!
Here is a woman married seven-plus years, and she still can't tell if her husband "is kidding or not."
I was frustrated with it.
Maybe that's how some families operate: in France or not.
Now that I've made my points: read the book if only for the swan chapter.
Sadly for me, I did not always enjoy reading it.
It is very funny.
Here is a couple that never seemed to speak with one another.

I just had it delievered today (an hour ago actually) and as soon as I got it, I tried it.
The set up was easy and basic like you would see in a normal alarm clock.
This product is really good.
I will try this for sure tonight and see how it goes.
It wasn't hard at all.
I of course looked at the directions just in case so I can do it right.
The battery area was easy to unscrew, it took me no less than 5 minutes.
It didn't come in like made in China like the other reviews have had.
Of course after I tried to activate the alarm (since this is the reason why I got it) and it wasn't so bad.
Over all, I have no compaint in it (yet!).
It ran around my carpet like it's suppose to.
The box says Clocky, well bascially like the box it showed on the pictures.
I ordered the black one.
It was pretty loud, can probably wake up the dead.
The clock of course came in as it shows on the pictures.

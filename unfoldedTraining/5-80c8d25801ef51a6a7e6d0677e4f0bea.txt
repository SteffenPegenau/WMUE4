Would I get Nylon or cotton?
Also, I bought cotton so there would be no issues with static cling.
It has been so long that I had a skirt that was not lined that buying this seemed a chore.
I got this half slip in white, size large.
This is what I chose and I am happy with it.
It is long, but then the skirts I have are long.
Should I get 6 gores or 4?
The elastic could be a bit sturdier, but I won't wear it often and elastic can be replaced.
It fits nicely and lays well under the see-through skirts that I got it to wear with.
Long or short?
It fits and the material is nice.
It looks just like the picture (there is a picture if you click the Title).
So, Happy is as Happy does.
I have not washed it, but it should do well as it is all cotton.
Should I get the one that could be cut to fit my length?

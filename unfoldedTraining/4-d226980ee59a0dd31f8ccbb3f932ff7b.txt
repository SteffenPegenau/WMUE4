Not the entire gang.
Pretty good movie with good actors and story.
Like some people say Johnny Ringo wasn't at the Gunfight at the O.K.
It shows the realtionship between Earp and Holiday.
Not that bad though.
He does a really good job and beats the bad guys.
I want to say that just three of the Clanton gang got shot down, not everybody in the gang.
Though Holiday would never admit it, he was good friends with Wyatt Earp.
It may not be all accurate.
Lots of action and a really neat gunfight at the end.
I read somewhere that Billy Clanton and two others got shot.
Kirk Douglass does a good Doc Holiday, who is sick with TB.
Corral and Ike Clanton didn't get shot.
Ike Clanton died later.
I've never seen any Burt Lancaster movies, until I saw this one.
And I was impressed by his portrayal of the famous gunslinging lawman, Wyatt Earp.

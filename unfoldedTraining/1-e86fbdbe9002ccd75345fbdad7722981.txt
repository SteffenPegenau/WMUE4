And I found myself skipping chapters and finding out in the long run, that I didn't miss anything by skipping them!
Dracula has a library, that he wants someone to catalog-thats scary?
And I have never read a book that I was 65 chapters in and still waiting for something EXCITING to happen.
I give it two thumbs down :(
Sad!
I have read a lot of books in my day.
!The plot seem to go around in circles at times, and the story line could have been cut in half.
I thought if I read one more chapter describing the mountains or the countryside I thought I would vomit.
This author, tried way to hard to describe so much.
We get it!
And I read over 600 pages to find that out?
This story line was "never ending" and it could have been cut in half and could have been so much better.
It was just too much.
Europe is beautiful!!!
This was more like history lesson and geographical lesson not a vampire noval at all.
Big deal.
What a disappointment this book was.

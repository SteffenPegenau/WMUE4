The heroine, Claire, was fairly likable because she was such an educated woman.
Now, THAT'S a keeper!
I like a strong Scot, and he fell short.
Harry, Trevelyn's brother and Claire's fiance, is a total bore.
Instead, read Knight in Shining Armor by this author.
(I enjoyed the fact that she loved to read, read, read.)
Jude Deveraux is a really good writer, but this is NOT her best work.
Don't waste your time on this book.
It's a shame.
The hero, Trevelyn, was a disappoinment.
She just fades away later in the story.
You would think that if there is supposedly so much hate and anger in this woman that there would have been more than one scene with her.
(He was plagued by malaria.)
It's almost like Deveraux was told that she had to turn in her finished book right away, so she had to wrap up the ending right then and there.
There is also one scene with Harry's and Trevelyn's mother and Claire.
Deveraux did not spend as much time on detailing the characters as she usually does.

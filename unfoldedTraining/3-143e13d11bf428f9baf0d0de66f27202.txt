The show that we as fans love so much.
So please!!!
Cheap!
To see and hear a different song over that sequence...well, it was just wrong!
Listen to your fans.
Producers of the show, those responsible for these dvd sets, if nothing else please put the original theme song back in with Season 4!
And this is made the most clear with the changing of the theme song.
Sure the narrative is just as potent, but it feels different.
Simply put...great season, bad dvd set.I realize it may be stupid to attack a collection of great episodes over something as trivial as the accompanying music, but the music was an important part of show.
That original music was a part of the original show.
It was important to all the WB shows.
And different isn't necessarily better.
To change the music somehow changes the show.
Personally, Paula Cole's song made me want to puke whenever I'd here it, but it just fit wonderfully with the title sequence.
Its not the same.

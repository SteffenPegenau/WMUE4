another test.
i waited to receive the pcmcia unit from another place and my 30 days return policy ran out.if you keep it, upgrade the firmware of the unit immediately.
1500'???
on mine, the WEP did not work at all with its own card for the laptop until i made the change... kinda sad...again, novell users, unless you upgrade to pure IP... stay away from this...
[not good].
still about 20' away from the base unit.
good reception.
granted i have about a foot of stucco walls.
then i walked outside.
skip this.
i covered the antenna part of the card in the laptop.
not even close...so when you get this, open it and use it immediately.
they dont pass ipx...in my office of like 50' away from the linksys pcmcia card?
outside the walls?
the signal drop by almost to 50-60%.so i stuck the unit by a window on the second floor.
novell ipx users?

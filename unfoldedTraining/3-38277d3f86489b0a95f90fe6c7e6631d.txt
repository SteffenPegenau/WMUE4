However, it was VERY predicatble, even for fans who have only read a couple of the V.C.
Give me a break...
Andrews fan for almost 20 years.
A ritzy lifestyle, interesting people, fancy mansions.
HER books were much better then, much better than the books the ghostwriter puts out now.
But, all in all, this one has a great storyline and interesting characters and was a really quick read.
Why?
I liked Willow and wanted to know more after reading it and this book picked up the trail really well.
Yep, things are going to look rosy for Willow for a bit, but as a fan, I KNEW something bad would happen right before the ending and it did.
Great for any V.C.
Okay, let me start off by saying I've been a V.C.
Typical.
Andrews books.
Because he uses a formula to write these books.Now this book had a great story.
Andrews fan.And, as for those awful letters at the end of these books.

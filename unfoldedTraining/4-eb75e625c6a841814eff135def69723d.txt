Although you may not be the biggest fan of space/psychedelic rock, you will still enjoy this dvd.
Don't miss your chance with The Flaming Lips.
This is not just a concert, it is a performance.
A thing- Buy this DVD.
I would put their stage performance on a must see level rivaled only by the likes of bands/artists such as Garth Brooks, Trans Siberian Orchestra, Jimmy Hendrix, Queen, and Eric Clapton.
Ok, so you got me..
Try to imagine smashing up a Cirque du Soleil show with a Pink Floyd concert.
Many of you have said that Wayne Coyne is very humble.
I never got the chance..
B Thing- Watch this DVD.
I agree 100 fold.
I have never seen Jimmy Hendrix, or Queen live...
I live in Oklahoma City and this guy can be seen anywhere from public charity appearances to mowing his lawn with no shirt and a beer.
The guy is cool.
But I watched the DVDs.
C thing-Inevitably become a fan.

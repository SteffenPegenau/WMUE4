There's an old Texan saying " All hat and no cattle".
Hence the two stars.
If you are an academic, there is too little empirical data.
If you are a student, its too shallow.
Chapter 5 does provide some value, as does the case study on Western Australia Chapter 12.
Not one of his best.
Very repetitive.
Jim Kayalar is the managing director and founder of Business Tune Up.
Better to get a book about branding.
Who is the book written for?
Jim Kayalar is a Certified Management Consultant with the Institute of Management Consultants USA (IMC-USA) with 20 plus years of experience in a myriad of industries.
Nearly all chapters start out with a definition of branding by some marketing authority.
Philip Kotler's contribution on chapter 5 is OK, but outdated.
If you are a destination marketing professsional, there is hardly anything you can gain from reading this book.
That's how I felt after reading this book.

this woman must release another album...NOW!
it never disappoints.
the vocals are rather limited but it doesn't matter.
it is (excuse my french) f****** fierce!!
i can't even go on about how much i love this cd.
it makes me want to dance all night long.
i would be your turkish delight.
check her out!
it's trash-a-riffic fun!
i tend to have a weakness for trampy looking girl singers.
omg...let u me tell u... this has to be one of the trashiest cd's i own.
my bf pointed it out to me.
i bought this cd on a whim.
!the music is an infectious mix of turkish and dance beats.
and yes nez.

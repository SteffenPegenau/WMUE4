Wouldn't even power on.
It arrived.
I hooked it up.
Hooray for brick and mortar stores and in-store demo'ing.
Boy, was I psyched to receive this baby in the mail.
It died after 1 hour.
I sent it back.
I let it acclimate to room temperature for over 24 hours.
Amazon was very fast in getting the second unit to me.
It arrived.
Boo for buying online.
I read up on this receiver and was impressed by the features in this price range.
I figured I must have gotten a bum receiver and opted to exchange.
Wow.
2 of the 3 hdmi inputs were shorted out and this thing wouldn't even recognize that speakers had been hooked up to it.
I let it acclimate to room temperature for over 24 hours.
I will take my refund and remain sated with my aging, yet functioning, Pioneer receiver.
I hooked it up.

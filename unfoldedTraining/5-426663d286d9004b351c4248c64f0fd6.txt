Bounce!
Mr.
Nothing can contain him, yet something does!
Bounce.
"I'll tell you how it is UNEXPECTED!
This is Mr.
Even unbouncable products.
How can that be unexpected?
"Unexpectedly, you say?
He does not demand that the small world of the Mr. Men bow down to his whims.
He does not CRAVE social interaction.
His name is Mr.
Bounce is more ... manly than that.The vigor of his physical nature is matched by his personal resilience, he is always willing to carry on, even though he must bounce unexpectedly.
Bounce is the Jane Austen character we have been dreaming of for children ages 4-8.
NO, Mr.
He is no Mr. Tickle.
His own sense of propriety, perhaps?
His own limitations that being able to break the laws of physics does not allow one to break social laws?Mr.
Yet...he lives to tell about it.
Bounce can bounce off ANYTHING!

He spends to much time trashing bands he knows nothing about.
And though published in 2002, he does not mention Live at Red Rock.
How would he know, he was just a child.
Or Foghat or anyone else with a solid backbeat?
Apparently he does not either, at least not to any degree.
IE, good riddance Jimmy.
Finally when he called Sammy Haggar a 'goon' I got peed.
This book is all about Jimmy not Neil Young.
Ever see Stempenwolf live at night for free in a Grant's parking lot?
Why?
I trudged through this book and actually threw in down several times.
I intend to loan it out to some one who has had one of my other bios for 6 years.
Ever see Hendrix booed like I did in Tampa 1968?He states several times that Neil does not listen to other bands.
Hey Jimmy, ever here of Montrose?
Biographers who do not distance themselves to be objective always fail as this book does.
Apparently Jimmy thinks ONLY Neil Young did rock and roll in the 70s.

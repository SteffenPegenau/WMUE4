I would not normally go for this look but I can not get over how good it looks and perfroms in my shop.
From the time I took it out of the box I was impressed.
I almost missed it.
The radical look of this saw sets it apart in the shop.
I have 10 guys per working in the shop using the saw from 7am - 7PM.
I got the mail in rebate on the finish nailer as well and this was $189 value.
There is nothing I can not do with this saw.
It does save space over the old bulky Dewalt I had and the cut is as clean as silk.
We purcahse this and the Makita at the same time.
The value of the saw with the mail in rebate was icing on the cake.The best slide I have every used!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can not get over the capacity, digital readout ease of user and the accuracy of the laser.
The Makita saw does not come close in terms of accuracy.
You could not purchase a better unit.
!
I WISH AMAZON would have played this up a little better on thier site.

If you read my review on that I gave in and gave it five stars.
Every aspect of the movie was very, very badly done.
"Oh man", "This can't be good" blah, blah lines were bad.
Let me explain: Here I am in a hot movie theater and Speed 2 begins so stupidly.
But it was never boring.
I knew it wouldn't get any better, so I tried to enjoy it.
Bollock's character was great in Speed.
I believe that if Bollock was out and they went with original characters this movie could have been higher graded.
What happened?
Okay, let's review: Speed was great!
But entertaining.
When did she decide to jump on the annoying truck.
Why?
This is lame.
But, it also entertained me.

How can you remake something?
If you watch both films, and just watch you may see humor in the contrasts?
Maybe it is just different?
It may be overstated.This film left me with questions.
Jude Law was a producer on the film.
It was a play and that was dialog.
Maybe not?There are a number of reviews here and I am in the middle.
I look at this movie in a different way.
He has been compared with Micheal Caine.
There is context and distraction from the vantage of new technology that interlaces the film.
Hey "Alfie"?
Now its video tech?Micheal Caine at his worst is always good.
Possibly it was a slip or intended that the hairdresser was an actor was a hairdresser.
Jude law could have been more subtle, and let me process this situation more.
It wasn't "wow, I want to see that again. "

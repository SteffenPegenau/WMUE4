I use the largest and smallest ones for prepping.
They hit the wall and then the floor.
Plastic's definitely out, and we've had problems with the stainless bowls.
They have a heavy base.
This will be our second set.
I know Pyrex has changed owners, so I was a little skeptical at first, but they've held up fine.
I've used these for prepping and I do like these.
They didn't break, chip, or crack.
I'd rate them 4.5, but there's no half-star.
As far as a dog bowl, I'd give it 5 stars.
The middle one (1 1/5 qt.)
She's even knocked the diner over onto our vinyl floor (she did the same with the stainless) to get underneath the diner looking for more food.
The lip on these bowls fit PERFECTLY in her diner - obviously the size of the bowl depends upon the size/type of the diner.
I use for our dog's doggie diner.
They are a bit shallow to use a mixer in, that's the reason for the 4 not 5 stars, but I've found they work carefully with a whisk.

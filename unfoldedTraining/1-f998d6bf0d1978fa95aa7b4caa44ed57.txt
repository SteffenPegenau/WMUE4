The unit would not load or unload slides.
Now Minotla claims it is damaged and not under warranty.
It made all sorts of grinding noises.
Scanned a few slides, then came back to in a month later.
Before you buy this unit, look for others will similar repair problems.
I wish I did before I bought this scanner.
I purchased this unit in Dec 2003.
Minolta fixed it under warranty.
When they shipped it back, it had a damaged face plate.
Won't load or eject the film holder.
I did not care about minor cosmetic damage to the face plate.
I stupidly did not bother to call them back and demand it to be fixed again.
Not recommened do to the poor workmanship and faulty design that requires frequent trips to the repair shop.
I did not use if for several months, and now the unit is dead.
I subsequently scanned over 500 slides with it with good results.

THE ECHO WENT AWAY.
I NOTICED AN ANOYING ECHO IN THE VOICE AUDIO.
WHEN I REPLAYED THE SAME SCENE AGAIN.
THE FIGHT SCENES KICK ... NOT TO MENTION THE BULLET TIME.
AND THEN AGAIN IT WOULD COME BACK AT TIMES.
THERE IS SO MUCH OF THE GAME TO STILL FIND OUT.
SO THAT IS MY MAIN FLAW IM NOT SURE WHAT MAY BE THE PROBLEM.
BUT WHAT I HAVE FOUND OUT SO FAR IS COOL ENOUGH.
...
BUT HEY IT WAS THE MATRIX THAT CREATED BULLET TIME.
IT DEFINATLY BEATS MAX PAYNE.
DURING SOME SCENES.
THIS GAME KICKS MAJOR ...
BUT THE GAME IS STILL TIGHT.
I WANTED TO GIVE IT 4.5 STARS BUT I COULDNT IT IS LOADED WITH ACTION AND ALOT OF SURPRISES.

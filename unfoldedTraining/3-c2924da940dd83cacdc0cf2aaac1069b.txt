It left me feeling a bit empty really,
What next?
How does he really feel about teaching?
I've never been a fan of sequels.
What happened to those eyes?
First it was Angela's Ashes, now 'Tis.
But something is missing... We never get to really learn about McCourt himself.
Why does he take to drinking - a habit he so detested in his father?
There are just too many unanswered questions.
McCourt The Movie?
They never seem to work, and 'Tis is no exception.
'Tis came across as a series of random thoughts, loosely sewn together.
McCourt owns up to his mistakes.
I loved Angela's Ashes but found 'Tis to be much of a muchness without the touching freshness and tense story of its predecessor.
'Tis continues the story of Frank McCourt; now living in America and trying to make a life for himself.
It is still written with the same McCourt gruff (often black) humour, and at least it's honest.

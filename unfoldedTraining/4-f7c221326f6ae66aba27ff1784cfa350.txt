We've done a beef roast, three chickens, and two turkey breasts.
I don't inject my food.
Ronco?
But I can honestly recommend this to anyone.
I owe them an appology.
It's fantastic!SET IT AND FORGET IT!
I was skeptical.
Names from past TV commercials that I buzzed through via videotape.
Popiel?
OK.
This rotisserie does absolutely everything as promised/advertized.
And if you buy right now, you get a GINZU knife!
If your chicken is around 4-lbs, one hour and you've got tasty food... same with the turkey breast.The best thing is the price!
I don't know of anything else I've spent $35 on that has given me as good a return (except for some Microsoft stock I bought many years ago ;-} ) Certainly not any kitchen tool.The video tape is rather dumb.
I probably won't do fish as I don't want to risk the chance that the appliance will smell like fish for the rest of its life.

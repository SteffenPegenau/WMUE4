I did like the taste, but the warmth and the melted chocolate and caramel was not good.
After 24 hours in the refrigerator, I opened the box.
These bars might be very good if they did not need to be refrigerated.
I tried putting the unwrapped bar in the microwave for 5 seconds and it was still to hard.
I did not enjoy a warm, melted bar.
I received mine in a box that stated to refrigerate before opening.
It took 10 seconds to make the bar edible.
When I tried to eat the bar, I could not bite off a piece to chew.
I wish I could find these local so that I did not have to suffer shipping meltdown.
The bar was hard and cold.
I noticed I ate a lot less at lunch.
The thing I liked the most is that I stayed full from breakfast through lunch.
I could see without even opening the wrappers that the bars had melted in shipment.
I just can not stand the warm, melted condition of the bars.
I did get a refund.
They were caved in.

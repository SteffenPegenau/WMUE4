I feel that other than him being a bed-hopping cop, there's not much else.
I'll give the other books a try.
He was never fully developed.
I knew more about Lucas Davenport, supercop, superlover than I did the killer.
Davenport's history could have been done throughout the series.
Instead of feeling contempt for the killer, I pitied him.
The same for the killer.
I didn't know what drove him as a person or as a cop.
You know, a little at a time.
They have to move faster than "Rules" did.
Initially, maddog's parents were mentioned but nothing ever came of them that might have explained his way of choosing his victims.
I have most of the books in this series and had planned to read them consecutively, but after reading "Rules" I've decided to give myself a little break.
This is the first book I've read by John Sandford.
Don't get me wrong, I liked the book, but it's snail's pace didn't help any.
I didn't get my "why" satisfied.

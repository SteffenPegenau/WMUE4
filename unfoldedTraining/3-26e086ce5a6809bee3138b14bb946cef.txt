The characters are well explained.
The Dating Game-The book the dating game by Natalie Standford was a very interesting book.
They have minds of there own.
So I wouldn't read it again.
Other girls who love reading "Love" books would want to read this
The reason why is that it talks about things about girls and not as much as to guys.
But that is what I think.
The book is based on the teens and not the adults and teachers but only one guy teacher Dan.
This book kind of relates to me but not as much.
It really didn't interest me, it wasn't a pull me in kind of book.
It might be different for other girls.
They are best friends.
The main points never rush into love.
I think that a girl would want to read this and not a guy.
But that is my own opinion.
Every girl has a crush on him.The three main characters are Holly, Mads, and Lina.

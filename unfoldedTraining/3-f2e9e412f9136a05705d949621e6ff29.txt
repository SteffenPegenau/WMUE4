3rd - why can't I compare my teams stats vs. the rest of the league?
First off, this game is visually amazing.
I know the game says it has them, but I've yet to be in one.
Oh yeah, one more thing, why isn't the game rumble pack compatible?
I still love to play it, just not as much as I loved playing NFL2K (and I like hockey better).
In NFL2K, I can see leaders in all of the statistical categories but not in this game.
If I'm playing a full season, I would expect there to be some injuries during the year.
I have to play all 82 games to get to the playoffs.
4th - there are no fights!
The graphics and sound are great, as is the majority of the game play.
Oh well.
I do have some minor problems with it.
First of all, you can't play a shortened season.
I've broken the glass every other game but haven't seen a fight.I hope they get these things fixed in the next version.
2nd, where are the injuries?
It would seem like a perfect fit.

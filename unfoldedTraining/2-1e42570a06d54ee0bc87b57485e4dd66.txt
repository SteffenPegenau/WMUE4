I guess I was too good.
How those toddlers got up and down those stairs in their walkers without getting hurt is beyond me!
Sad family of slobs.
If it was Diner Dash, they'd get mad at the waiting and leave!
As others said, it was the same thing over and over.
Great concept and it was fun...at first.
I finished the whole game within just a few hours.
I personally didn't care for it.
)and I wanted a baby gate for those stairs.
The kids were all ignored with no discipline.
The family was patient waiting for their meals.
What was those 3 lives for?
Yes, I'm putting too much into it but I don't think it was worth what I paid ($20!)
The only time the family interatcted with eachother was at the kitchen table.
I wanted to get after them for messing up what I just cleaned (that's true life!

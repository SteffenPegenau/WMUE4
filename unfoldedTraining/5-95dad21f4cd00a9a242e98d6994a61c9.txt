To think of the bad guy as a good guy too.
I just loved John Medina.
I liked Niema too.
I can't say how many times I've read it already.
But at least he wasn't a "bad" guy for the wrong reasons...
That usually doesn't happen to me.
I love this book.
I don't think I would have liked the book at all if she blamed John instead of herself.
I'm afraid that it'll fall to pieces before I've read it enough.
I got a knot in my stomach a few times when he thought (or said) a few things that were so romantic.
Imagine there being a real guy out there like that.
It was awful when she lost Dallas but I think she handled it just right.
Strange.
I actually liked Ronsard too.

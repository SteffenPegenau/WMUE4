The problem was that as much as I liked Corpse Bride, I disliked this movie.
I thought that maybe I missed something.
The detail was outstanding.
Corpse Bride gave us a detestable evil character, and a surprise ending, Nightmare gave us neither.
Because of the negative comments posted to my original review, I decided to watch the movie again, on Showtime, in HD-Big screen.
Waited for it to get better, and it never did.
Loved the dog.
I think it's an absolutely terrible movie, and I was a little too generous giving it a second star.
Update on this movie.
By the way, in this class of movie, I like Coraline the best.Original review: I watched this via streaming.
In Corpse Bride, the characters seemed genuine, and I really sympathized with the two brides.
In Nightmare, all the characters were shallow, not developed, and not lovable at all.
My opinion has not changed.
Even the dog failed to give me any emotion.
Totally bored throughout.

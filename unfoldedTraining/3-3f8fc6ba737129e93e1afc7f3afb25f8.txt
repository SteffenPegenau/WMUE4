You barely have room without the laptop.
Anything more is just doesn't work.
Didn't want to return it.
I saw this bag and liked the look.
It was too cumbersome with this bag.
Going from class to class, I have to get in and out of my bag all the time.
However, I'm a college student and you don't have room for books when the laptop is in the bag.
I had been searching for a nice big bag for my 17" laptop.
It has a rounded bottom which is not condusive to carrying books.
Good looking bag nice and big but not very functional
If all you want is to carry your laptop and a few files this might work.
It is akward to get into from the back of the bag.
I really liked the look of this bag.
Thought the feature of not being able to open whill on the back was smart.
Really nice looking big bag though.

If you pull on it even slightly too hard it falls off the stroller completely!
Wish I knew these things beforehand.
BIG MISTAKE.
The holder underneath is SO small.
I didnt even realize or forgot there was a cup holder as apparently it was so cheap it fell off and now its missing.
We have to hand pocket books and diaper bags on the handles which makes for obnoxious pushing.
I am so disappointed and frustrated with this stroller.
I put this on my registry for no reason more than it was Mickey Mouse.
I love the style and quick and easy to take in and out of the trunk.
The sun shade is not maneuverable on the sense you can not pull it down to block the sun out it stays put where it is and folds up and down, thats it.
It is lightweight and easy to push.
Its the simplest things that make life SO much easier when your out with the little ones.
I even tried a smaller diaper bag still wont fit.
SO frustrating!
So we just hardly use it at all.
Diaper bag wont fit.

Christ I'm a genius!
I smell a hit!"Blehhh.
Because really, they're men, but everyone will think they're women!
Hahaha!
And completely original too!
Oooh oooh wait wait wait...
I smell excrement.
I'd say it's the worst movie ever, but I've yet to see "Little Man".
Instant comedy gold!
Jesus people did you actually watch the movie?
Even better idea!
I can just hear him thinking: "Hey I've got a great idea for a hilarious and original comedy!
Histerical!
How is it possible this movie is averaging 3 1/2 stars?
Man, that one has got to take the cake.But as for this movie: the plot is ridiculous, the racism atrocious, the acting makes Paul Walker look like an Oscar winner, and the premise just so lame it makes me want to castrate the writer.
We'll have two MALE fbi agents go undercover as WOMEN!
Ditch this crap.
They'll be two BLACK men pretending to be WHITE women!
Except the audience, and we'll all laugh at the pranks they pull on people!

Plus my dogs are tiny.
I literally just received this about an hour ago and was super excited to set it all up.
It arrived in two days when it wasn't expected until Tuesday (today is Saturday).
If CS doesn't help me out, it's going back and I'll just get a larger water dish for my dogs.Okay, it's been concluded the leaking is from splashing, so we turned down the stream and will see how it goes.
So far, I've noticed it leaks a lot.
That was nice.
It's also very loud.
It's not from my dogs as they haven't been around it much since I set it up.
And see if they have any recommendations for the leaking issue.
:)
I am going to email the company like another reviewer suggested and ask for a complimentary motor.
BF has also come home and said the motor is definitely bad.
I'll give it a week.
I am sending an email to request a new one and will see how it goes.
The leaking isn't as bad now as it was right after setting it up.

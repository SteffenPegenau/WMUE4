Pie fights in Star Trek?
I really don't think slapstick humor in Trek suits very well.
Only redeeming factor that I enjoyed from the book is the Federation survey team that crash lands on the planet.
Yep.
This is humor that you'd see in a 3 Stooges episode, not Trek.
Best that Trek has to offer?
Is it funny?
Matter of opinion I guess, but I found the humor in a pie fight lacking.
No, but definitely not the worst.
One of the great vehicles that Star Trek used to convey a story is humor.
I'm glad to see that not every starship, no matter what size, has access to holodecks (yeah I know pre-generation), rec-decks, and libraries.
I find the humor to be mundane or almost "British."
The boredom that the crew was suffering from was protrayed nicely from the author.
Yet, in Ford's "How Much For Just The Planet?"
"A Piece Of The Action", "Star Trek IV" used humor appropriately and sparingly in their story.

$1600 down the drain.
I am thankful they are replacing but a tv should last much longer than 2 1/2 years.
Samsung won't repair or replace.
Samsung replaced capacitors even though it was out of warranty.
Well after much arguing back and forth with Samsung they sent someone out to look at my TV again.
Even the tv repair man said if Samsung was not going to cover I should just go buy a new TV.
I then told the tech the picture wasn't the same.
Well there shouldn't be any problems.
Tv started taking long to turn on.
He said a panel replacement can be $1000.00
No more samsung for me.
Said it is a totally different problem.
Next day I noticed 3 lines on right side of TV.
lasted 2 1/2 years.
They told me it was a bad panel but they are going to replace.

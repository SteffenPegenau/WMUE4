Overall I like it.
This was appreciated on many red eye flights with a darkened cabin.Now the Kindle.
It was very well made and had a battery that would not quit.
It is made in China and if feels that way.
The way it retrieves books so quickly and seamlessly is excellent.
It is cheaply made and raises durability issues.
The on and off switch is poorly placed and will certainly fail early as it is so cheaply done.
The leather cover really does not fit.
It was very well made though and was back lit.
I started a book 3 hours ago and I am already at half battery.This is a first class idea with mediocre execution.
THE BATTERY LIFE IS AWFUL.
I had the early Rocket Book.
Eventually it became impossible to get current books for it.
It goes down just by sitting (with the Sprint connection off).
There is no back light.

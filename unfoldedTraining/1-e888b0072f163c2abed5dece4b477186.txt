After 1 year and a half, the camcorder died on me.
Canon repaired it.
!
After 1/2 a year it had problems connecting to my computer.
I wanted to make really good movies at a low cost.
This was ridiculous.
My first camcorder was a samsung hi8 camcorder but I wanted a DV camcorder for a low price so I purchased the Canon ZR80.
I was satisfied at first.
I am never going with Canon again.
It died during the summer so I'm getting the Panasonic GS300 for christmas.
I loved the effects and picture quality outdoors.
DON'T BUY A CANON ZR CAMCORDER!!!!!!!!!
I read other reviews and other people complained of other or similar models in the ZR series dying after the 1 year warranty was up.
The nightshot or lowlight mode makes the picture brighter but more grainier and slow frame rate.
The indoor quality was really bad.

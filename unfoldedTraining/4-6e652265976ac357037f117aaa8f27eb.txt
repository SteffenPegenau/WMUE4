beats are dope, lyrics are very good, what else?
(i blame all the commercial bull i've been exposed to).
this cd has differ type of production on it.
his style of rapping is a cross between eligh and murs.
If grouch had beats like this- man - wow!
i promise they will suprise you!
but don't forget- psc's flows are better than the average legend!
anyways- luckyiam.psc represents on this.
honestly- as much as i love living legends- a lot of their stuff requires a couple of listens before they grow on you.
legend fans who have been dissapointed by some of the beats will love this too.
i wished the other legends would approach their new releases in this manner.
THIS CD CAUGHT ME BY SUPRISE.
But- i fell for this one on the first listen!
basically that means his flows are pretty deep and can make you laugh at the same time.
ever since i was introduced to living legends- i have been listening mostly to sunspot jonz, grouch and eligh's stuff.

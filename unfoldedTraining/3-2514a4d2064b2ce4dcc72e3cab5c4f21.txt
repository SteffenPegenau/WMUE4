WHERE WAS THE PASSION?
THE MUSIC DID NOT DISPLAY HIS STRONG POWERFUL RANGE AS IN THE FIRST CD.
ANDRE SHOULD TAKE A GOOD HARD LOOK AT HIS STRENGTHS AND GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT.
MY FRIENDS ,HEARING THE MUSIC ALSO FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM.
THIS WAS A SOFT , GENTLE ANDRE.
OK FOR SLEEPLESS NIGHTS .
MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE MUSIC OF ANDRE STARTED WHEN PBS HAD HIS TOSCANY SPECIAL AS A FUNDRAISER.
I BOUGHT THE TAPE AND CD.
I BOUGHT THE VIDEO.
THE THOUGHT OF A NEW ALBUM WAS EXCITING AND I BOUGHT IT.
I WA S ENCHANTED BY HIM AND HOOKED ON HIS MUSIC.
IT WAS MAGICAL.
ON ROMANZA, THE DUETS TOUCHED MY SOUL.
(ROMANZA).
HE SEEMED TO TONE DOWN WHEN DOING A DUET.
I TOOK THE VIDEO TO A SENIOR CENTER AND THEY ALSO FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM.

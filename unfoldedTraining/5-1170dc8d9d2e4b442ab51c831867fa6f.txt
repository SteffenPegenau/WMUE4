"Real Talk" is definitely a step up from "Street Dreams".
Some Other good songs are: "GANGSTA", "Ghetto", "Po Po's" and "Can You Hear Me".The Track listing on Amazon is wrong.
"Won't Stop, Don't Stop" is a nice song with laid back beat.
"Real Talk" is a party/street/gangsta rap album with equally great beats.
Just a accapella.
His flow is changed in the song.
He got the talent and unlike other rappers he is not getting played out even after his singles been playin' all over the radio.
"Street dreams" is a party album with great beats and some nice lyrics!
"Intro" is performed by Black Ice.
Fabolous is not like some other mainstream rappers (50 Cent).
"Baby" is probably the best song with intellegent lyrics!
The video is pretty good too!
I think this cd deserves higher ratings than its gettin' now.
The songs are not in order and some are not even in the album.Pick this album if you liked his other albums.
Lyrics, howerver, are improved in this album.

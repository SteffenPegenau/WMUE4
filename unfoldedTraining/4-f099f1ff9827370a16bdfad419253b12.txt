The main character of this book is Shawn McDaniel.
Though his eyes do move from time to time he never knows where.
so you get to hear everything Shawn would.
But many things make you think he is.
So, why would Shawn's dad want to kill him?
Shawn has a disease called cerebral palsy.
The next best part of this book is that the book is through Shawn's point of view.
You never know if Shawn's dad is going to kill him or not.
Shawn is in a vegetated state, to put it briefly he cannot voluntarily move not a single solitary muscle, not even his eyes.
I like it mostly because of the suspense the reader is put in.
He also frequently has seizers and his dad hates to see them and thinks Shawn is going through a lot of pain.
I loved the book.
Well read the book and find out.
so the question is, does Shawn want to die?
Needless to say this book is interesting.
He is 14 years old and thinks his father is trying to kill him.
Oh by the way I recommend this book to ANYONE because I think its great.

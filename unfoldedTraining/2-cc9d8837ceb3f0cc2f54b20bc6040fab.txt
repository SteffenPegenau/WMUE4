15 years later since I bought their album and I still play this in my car.
I thought they could have done a much better job.
And everyone around me was listening to pop and rap.
I won;t go into the whole music dynamic but man this CD sux camel b@lls.
If you want the venus in fur it's on the Nico album along with heroin which is included here.
And the sister ray recording?
better of starting with their The Velvet Underground as an intro- much better.
Ugh!
as an individual.
HUGE Velvet fan.
THAT'S THE only reason I bought this.
Warning- once u understand where Reed and the Velvet's coming from u WILL become addicted.
enjoy!
For me rap as I grew up in the inner city but this opened up MY LIFE!
Get the import best of or the bootleg recordings.

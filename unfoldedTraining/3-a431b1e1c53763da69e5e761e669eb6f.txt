The extras - such as they are, are found on both sides.
Still I thought perhaps that was the older one.
It is very odd, to be sure.
It looks like he falls only 15-20 feet.
But whose brainiac idea was to make it a flipper?
The next to the last scene with Connery falling to his death has been oddly cut.
Still someone thought of splitting the movie into to halves.
I ordered this wonderful movie because it is simply a wonderful movie.
However, I remember seeing this years ago and Connery falls, his body limp as it pluments deep into the canyon.
Wrong!!
However, this really is a really good movie.Just don't get to hung up on the weird things that are mentioned here and by others.
I knew it was likely since I read what others had said.
5 stars for the movie.
Here's another odd one.
Wrong!!
Why was this cut, is a mystery.
It only runs 129 minutes.
The movie could easily have fit on one side.
Surely the 2010 edition wouldn't be like that.

If I pay $5 to ship it back, and they give me my $5 back, then I'm basically sending in the bag with a loss of $5.
Forget that!
I bought this for about $5 with $5 shipping.
But Wait!
The seller makes you pay for return postage.
It's like I'm paying to get rid of it!.
So I'm all happy, ready to return this item.
I place my laptop over it and I think, it's too small for my laptop.
The item description states that it could fit 15.4" laptops.
Alright, so I have a Laptop with a 15.6" screen and if you include the bezel,it is 16" altogether.
Heh, no!
I'd rather keep it and give it to someone who could use it.
Nope, I place my laptop inside the bag and zip it up and there is this large pocket of air around the top and sides of the laptop.
I requested for a return, and soon it was authorized.
If you don't want your laptop sliding around in the bag and actually want to keep it safe, don't purchase this bag.
That means I won't have the bag or the money I paid for it.

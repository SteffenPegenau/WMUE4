I hope to write children's books like her one of these days.
It is a wonderfully fantastic book and I commend Mrs. Eloise Greenfield for writing it.
I would definetely reccommend this book to the young ones.
The poem in the book entitled, "Honey, I Love", is inspiring to me.
This is a great book for young students, as well as, older ones.
Mrs. Greenfield is a very talented writer.
I feel as if they could relate to it.
This is the book I most love written by Eloise Greenfield.
The other poems are also very nice,inspiring, and unique.
I read that poem and feel as if I'm the little girl in the poem.
Honey, I Love is a great book.
"Honey, I love", I love this book HONEY!
I read this book in fourth grade and loved it ever since.
Some of the poems in the book remind me of my life as a "little kid".
I love this book.

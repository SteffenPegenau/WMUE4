But again .
.
Single's kinda suck .
disappointing, but that's for another discussion.
It's a very good song and Twisted Transistor is great too.
In my opinion, Coming Undone isn't the best song on the CD anyway.
I wouldn't get this.
this is a single.
.
I do agree with many people that the direction koRn has been taking is sorta .
Plus, this gets two of the songs that saw the most radio airtime, and misses sevearl other great songs on it.
.
.
honestly if you "need" this song, the entire CD itself is mere pennies more than this.
.
Just get the CD.
.
Not really, no.

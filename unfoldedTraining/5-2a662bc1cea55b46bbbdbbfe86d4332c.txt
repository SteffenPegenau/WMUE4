Its not watered down, its not the sisterhood of the traveling pants writing.
everything that Joe Meno says about being a teenager and high school, is all so true.
The way that Joe wirtes as Brian is so beliveable.
i was in my friends room searching through a box of gossip magazines and empty boxes of incence when i say this book.
i read hairstyles of the damned in only a few days.
this is a real kid.
Brians love with his best friend, his finding of the misfits, everything just seems to be your life when your that age.
He cusses and thinks about sex and all of the stuff that really happends.
At first it was just the cover that made me pick it up, but after i opend the book and read the first 3 pages i had to borrow it.
After that i was in love.
Thanks
Just do it.
Hairstyles of the damned is got to be one of the best books ive ever read.
Read this book.
Everything about it is true.

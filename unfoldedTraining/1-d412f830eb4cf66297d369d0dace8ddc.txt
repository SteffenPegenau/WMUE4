IT still reads and plays commercial DVD.
It hurts less to throw one of those away.
This was a bad and an expensive idea.Think about it long and hard before you buy this.
I bought my DVDR80 in August of 2003.
I am going to replace this with a standard DVD player.
Wal-mart has a DVD Recorder for about $250.
I made ONE recording I kept with this unit.
It still read DVD+RW.
Whether the disk is made on the PHillips unit or on my PC with NERO, the disks will not read.
{Looks snazzy though!}
I could have bought a lot of DVDs for that.
Now it doesn't read them either.
About six months ago, it just quit reading DVD+R.
That makes this a $500 recording.
I have a $500 DVD player.

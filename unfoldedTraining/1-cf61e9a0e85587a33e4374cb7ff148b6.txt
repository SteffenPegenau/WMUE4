The movie contains, on average, about 10 lines of dialogue for every 7 minutes of film.
I had heard this was a 'slow' movie and I had adjusted my expectations accordingly.
I cannot remember a single satisfying scene.
I kept expecting to be drawn-in by thoughtful dialogue about humanity reaching the stars.
Some have touted this movie as sublime or sutle - hog wash.
I did NOT enjoy one minute of this movie.
I looked forward to uncovering the riddle.
It has absolutely no continuity - due in large part to endless (and quite meaningless) flashbacks.
Not even a thoughtful epiphany.
Even more frustrating, it lacks any sense of chemistry - I couldn't care less who dies and who lives.
It lacks a protagonist and an antagonist.
No laugh.
This movie is a TURKEY.
It lacks any sense of suspense - other than the viewers' own longing for thoughtful diaglogue to cause us to question our own existence.
No music.

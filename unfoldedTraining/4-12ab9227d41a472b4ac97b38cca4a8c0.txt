I ordered this toy from Amazon without being able to see it in person.
[...] I am glad the children love it.
It is comparable to a little tykes push car.
They are not little tikes plastic.
It has great sound affects, and the vibration is an attention grabber.
The seat/under seat storage hinge is plastic and seems flimsy.
She really likes to push her one year old brother on it.
It is pricey in my opinion.
I was sort of disappointed in the size.
No problems yet.
They bend a little when pressure is applied, so be careful not to break them off.
It is definately for a 1-3 year old.
My son climbs on and grunts and rocks(his way of asking to be pushed around).
The rocket is on the smaller size.
If you want to push your tot on it you have to hold on to the fins.
It is played with everyday.
Though my five year old plays with it.
My kids love it.

I just wish there was a book 4 because I want to see Brad and Melissa happy, too.
I love a book that gives me not only an escape, but an opportunity to feel something special...Bonding with characters and wanting good things to happen to them.
If it ends here, I don't get to see them find true love.
In fact, get the whole series!
This one is definitely worth your time.
That makes me sad.
The characters were deep, engaging, and real.
I'm also totally impressed with how the author brought out spiritual truths in such a natural way.
Without spoiling the plot twists I'll just say that more than once I got a warm, glowing feeling and parts of the story brought tears to my eyes.
:(
The story was riveting until the end.
The Ransom is the exciting conclusion to the Matthews and Matthews series.
Great read.
You'll be glad you did.
And yes, I even felt a bit sorry for the villain.
Nothing preachy here, just inspirational.

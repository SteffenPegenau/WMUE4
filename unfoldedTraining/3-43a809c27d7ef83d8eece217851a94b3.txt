If you buy it and don't like it, don't say i didn't warn you...
The quality is good, but it is extremely slow.
But i must admit, the quality is excellent.
of extra hard drive space.So the choice is yours.
Also it is a MEMORY HOG ON YOUR PC!!!
Took 2 hours to print a screenshot from Unreal 2 at best quality.
Its possibly because I'm using the parallel port, not the USB.
I HAD TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO FOR 2 HOURS!!
I got this after my OLD hp printer finally died.
Also if you set it to the max resoultion for printing, it requires 400 mb.
Also, NEVER USE THE CANCEL BUTTON ON IT!!!!
As the printer DID NOT come with a USB cable.
It sends a strange message to the comp.
On the included sample of photo quality paper, it looks fantastic.So if you buy this printer, buy a USB cable and have a lot of memory.
which the computer sends back to the printer and tells it to print from 20-80 pages of JIBBERISH.

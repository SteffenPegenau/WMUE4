Where was the teeth-grinding nostril flaring sex?
I am a United States Navy Man stationed in Asia (8 years) and I connected right away with the characters.
The whole story was great, but it was told with no passion.
Where was the sweat?
Why did the affair end so suddenly?
None of the relationships were ever fully developed.
Almost like reading an outline.I can't wait to read Taylor's next work.
Hell yes!
Where was the gut-renching neausiating fear?
Did I believe it?
The whole story seemed well structured and very controlled.
I felt some of the character generalizations were over done.
Too controlled.
I think if he lets loose a little we are in for a rush.
That was smooth and impressive.
The entire book seemed very real to me.
Fairchild was kind of a lame guy wasn't he?
Frustrating...What a marvelous job weaving the Vietnamese history in with the story.

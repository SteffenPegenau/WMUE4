wrong.Glitter shows Carey, not as having any IT songs, but as a smooth flow of music and class.
an hour of pure enjoyment, trust me, no one can go wrong with this one.
as i play this cd, there is not one song that i skip.
Carey is definately at the top of her game here.
they are all good songs.
which is quite suprising out of a Mariah album.
there aren't, however, any "oh my God, that is so amazing" type of songs.
What i found odd about Glitter is this... i was so hyped for this record.
but when i got it, i realized that i had a different opinion than i thought i would.
none that make you pee your pants when you hear them.Which is where this review should end right?
they usually come so wishy washy that you wear out one or two tracks.This record for sure, will go down as a Carey classic.
definately the best since Daydream.
but good.
i couldn't wait.
not amazingly good.

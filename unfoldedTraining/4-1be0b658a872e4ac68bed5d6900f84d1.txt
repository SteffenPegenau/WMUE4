Some people just didn't get it.
The extras are also nice too.
Dog Day Afternoon?
In closing, seeing this movie again takes me back to my childhood.
Expensive bomb, now a cult movie.
Howard The Duck, ladies and gentleman.
It's a movie about a talking duck from outer space, people!
It's nice to look back once in a while and remember actually having fun.
I just happened to be at Walmart and happened upon this little (ahem!)
Well, back when it made its debut, gem wasn't exactly the word most critics (and some moviegoers) had for it.
It's nice this underrated film finally got its day on DVD.
What were you expecting?
Oh, and I got it for five bucks.
gem.
I happened to be a fan of the Marvel comic it originated from and I did see this film back when it came out and I did enjoy it!
Needless to say, Howard The Duck was anything but a blockbuster.

I thought I was a soup-hater.
Now I'm expanding my horizons even more.If you haven't checked out Leanne Ely's books, I encourage you to do so.
Finally, I've learned to embrace new vegetables.
I'm 26 and only learned to love vegetables in my 20s.
It's great and I don't have so many leftovers that I feel like I'm eating the same thing all the time!
Try something new!
Who knew?!?
I've been faithfully using the original Saving Dinner for quite some time and purchased SDLC about 2 months ago.
Turns out I LOVE homemade soups and have a huge distaste for the canned stuff.
For starters, I thought going low carb was a fad.
Little did I know the nutritional benefits!
This is a big deal for me.
Since it's just me and my 1 year old DD, I use 1 week of menus to last 2 weeks.
Second, these menus serve 4 instead of 6.
Third, I've discovered I love soup.
If nothing else, learn how to plan a menu the way she does.
I love the low carb version equally but differently than the original.
Be adventurous!

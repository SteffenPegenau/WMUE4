It's another side to their musicianship.
But since it was a Zep side project I thought I would check it out.
It doesn't have the whole Big Band thing going on, but it's definitely got the rockabilly/blues/swing thing working.
This live version segues through several blues standards and sounds, at times, like a mini-concert of the Honeydrippers.
Nope, I didn't get it.
That entire CD (HTWWW) made me appreciate the breadth and depth of Plant's and Page's (and Bonham's) abilities more than ever.Now I appreciate the Honeydrippers.
I remember this album from its debut.
I didn't get it.
I was way beyond the whole rockabilly sound.
It's a Whole Lotta Fun.
It's an homage to their roots.
Not the Honeydrippers...Anyone who doesn't get this album -- or, more specifically, it's place in Zep history -- needs to check out the Whole Lotta Love medley on "How the West was Won."
Swing didn't swing.
I think I "get" what this was all about.
So what changed?

She was not funny at all.
Season 6 was probably the worst season of The Office.
Also, I don't know why the Ryan character is still on the show.
This season kinda reminded me of the few last episodes of Seinfeld.
He was however, funny in the some of the past seasons but this one he does nothing.
You can just tell they are running out of ideas.
Hopefully season 7 delivers the goods and end the show on a good note with a great season.
The season finale was truly pathetic.
The season 6 finale started something and they didn't know how to finish it.
There were a few good episodes though.
He adds nothing to the humor.
Even though he is a side character, he doesn't offer the one-liners such as Creed or Kevin.
Also, I hated the Kathy Bates character.
All the other finales were great.
The characters aren't really their usual selves in this season.

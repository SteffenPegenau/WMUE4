This is very irritating.I would not recommend purchase.
If not, it grinds for a while, then displays ERR.
There doesn't seem to be any way to adjust it.2.
My wife has had similar experiences lately.
Here are the major problems:1.
You must stand very still.
Poor accuracy.
We've lived with this scale for about a year (see my earlier review).
Then you have to get off and try again.
It can jump up or down by 4-5 pounds in successive readings (done within a few minutes).
Sensitivity.
It seems to read low consistently, and my measured weight is inconsistent.
I've given up on weighing myself first thing in the morning, because I'm not steady enough until I've been up for a while.
I am careful to stand on it the same way each time, but to no avail.
I am now dissatisfied.

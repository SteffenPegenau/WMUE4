Or bought a Hootie and the Blowfish album.
Blah.
What happened to the abstract poetics of the Joshua Tree?
!
Normalcy.
Can you tell I'm disgusted?
But after about 5,000 listens, I made myself like it.
When I purchased Pearl Jam's Binaural, I was vastly disappointed.
If I had wanted "straight-up rock and roll" from this band, I would have saved my money.
Whichever.
What happened to the textures and open-ended lyrics of Achtung Baby?
I am so disappointed.
U2 fans will know what I mean when I say this: the boys have finally "gotten over it."
When did I ever ask for normalcy from U2?
I don't think I'll be able to do that with this album.
Gone are the days of angst, intimacy and heartbreak in U2 songs; here are the days of sappiness, shallow lyrics and complete normalcy.

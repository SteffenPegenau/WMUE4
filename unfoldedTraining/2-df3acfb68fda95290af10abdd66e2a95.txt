I like Sade.
She is forcing herself to sing this stuff and is very uninterested in what she is singing.
This disc stands on its own.
It is bad music by itself.
I don't like this disc.
You won't like it.
If you like Sade, don't buy this.
I can't really express how bad this is.
Sade sounds great.
Not flattering to her at all.
This is Sade with a drum machine.
The first song is Country and Western Sade.
I don't blame her.
There are three songs I really love.
I do not compare discs to other discs the performer puts out.
You can throw the rest of this out.
The songs don't even have enough to allow her to put them over.
The songs are bad and the accompanying music is awful.

Why was he lured to an open field and how was a plane supposed to kill him .. why not just run him down on a Chicago Street, or just knife him, as was done at the UN.
couldn't they find an actress at least ten years older than him.
.
Makes no sense.
.
She looks his own age too.
.
How convenient that Cary Grant just hapened to meet Van Dam's mistress on the train and why did she lead him on and then drop him.
.
It seems the only reason was to put Cary Grant in the position of a murder .
This movie doesn't wear well at all...
And why was that fellow killed at the UN anyway?
.
So many scenes are forced and not credible, when you think about it.
he could have murdered anyone, anywhere .
Either does it make sense that his mother is his own age .

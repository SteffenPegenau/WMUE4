I did fall asleep because i thought it was cheesy, and not scary whatsoever.
and by saying I fall asleep I mean literally.
the movie just didnt have that scary factor of the first and second.
yeah maybe a 15 year old slasher fan would enjoy it to the end.
I kinda woke up from loud sound effects when Anthony anderson was getting killed, then found myself to fall back to sleep because i didnt really care how many times he got stabbed.
and seeing ghost face again was nostalgic enough.
but that doesnt say much does it?
but i hoped a better movie after 10 years of absence.
at this moment i gave it 2 stars.
it seemed better than third.
yes.
would I recommend this?
its also really distracting to stare at courtney cox's Botox ridden face, and Sidney character just cant carry this franchise anymore.
and nothing's wrong with that.
I personally didnt feel the groove on this but maybe if I watched it one more time I might change my mind.

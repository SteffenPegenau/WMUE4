Best known to the public for publishing "Soldier of Fortune" magazine.
(which I will check for blank/missing pages.)
BUY IT.
Too much of a pain in the ass.
If your new to this kind of warfare, this book is a great place to start.
Foreword by Robert K. Brown, Lt. Col. USAR (RETIRED).
So I'm keeping this one, and I'll be looking for another copy.
(but check the pages) :>)REPUBLIC!?
The author, Bob Newman, is a former Marine.
I would have given it 5 stars, but my copy had 17 blank pages.
My only option was to return it for a refund.
This book shoots straight.
Great book.
!
The info is GREAT.

:)
so i was very confused and upset.
pretty expensive.
the next day i had to go to a trip.
not working.
still.
when i checked it again.
so i left it there till about the evening.
but the issues were solved, and it was an amazing product.
so, when i got back, it wasn't working still.
??.
so i checked it out, and it was about $40.
so it had issues.
so i kicked it, and it worked.
i was out looking for a new charger for my scooter, when i fell upon this item.
when i received it....2 DAYS LATER, i tested it... it didn't work.
hope i helped.
i ignored that, but bought it.
but this item was reliable at times, but the connection was loose.

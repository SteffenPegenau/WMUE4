This was the worst movie since Babe!
I want to use it for target practice.
Crash on a desery island and have to survive?
!Heres a scary the scary thing.
What a huge disappointment.
Anybody want it?
Its still in the plastic.
Then I bought a DVD player and got it for free.
This was his worst movie.
Come on??
I have this movie on VHS.
Gee, thats a new concept.
I could never watch this movie again.
Oh and the pirates!
I'll say it again, what a disappointment.
Who has pirates nowadays?
WAtched it once.
I am a huge fan of Harrison Ford.
I give it negative 1 star.
Its free!The jokes were almost as bad as the story.

I went into this book thinking:1.
I'd love to see what working in Microsoft was like when things were just starting to get huge!4.
What a terrible book.
It lacks an interesting plot.
This is EXACTLY what it are going to be like when I graduate college this year!I was wrong on all counts.
All the characters are about my age!3.
Read ANYTHING else.
There is nothing I, as a 21 year old tech-savvy, internatioanl business major, could relate to.
Go.
It's slow and mostly pointless at times.
Think of all the excitement you have working in a cubical with situations much less funny than those you'd see in Office Space.
This a great author!2.
That is the premise of this book.
My friends and I are all computer nerds.
The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of a few mildly interesting situations scattered few and far between in the book.
It lacks characters the reader can enjoy.

(Or put AFAM down!
Her assignment for English, was to read "The Diary of Anne Frank".
Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld have truly done it again!
They have caught the reader in such a tight grip that they can't let go!
Anne Franks and Me is a novel based on a high-school aged girl named Nicole.
)This book is truly a treasure every home must own!
She finds herself in 1942 as a young Jewish Girl durring the times of the Holocaust.
It truly has something for everyone: love, adventure, tragedy and drama!
been the actual dream?
Or has her previous experiences(and life!)
I highly recommend this book to everyone!
Is her new life just a bad dream?
Nicole is an average girl: not the popular one, not the geeky one and not the prettiest one.
But she is so caught up doing her own every day things, that she bags her assignment and forgets about it.
But, when her class takes a field trip to an Anne Frank exibit, Nicole's world is turned upside down.

I expected more from the song "Anarchy Camp".
They hate George Bush as much as me.
It has the video for "Franco Un-American" and "the idiot son of an @$$hole (note:this is a live performance)and 8 minutes of the film "Unpresedented".
Well, enjoy!
It is hilarious.
I thought it was gonna be non-stop punk but it just wasn't so great.
That film inspired NOFX to make this album.
The enhanced cd is awesome.
In addition to this cd you should buy "Pump up the Valuum".
It is a over-look of how George W. Bush rigged the 2000 election.
It's so annoying.
I like NOFX and all especially the video for "Franco Un-American", this is the first NOFX I got but it just wasn't what I expected.
But this cd still has some cool songs.
I especially hate the song "She Nubs".
I love the song "the idiots are taking over" though.

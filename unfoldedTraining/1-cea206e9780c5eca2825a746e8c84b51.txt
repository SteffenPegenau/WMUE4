You start to fall asleep right away.
(in the last 15 minutes) It makes no sense and it leaves so many dead ends and questions that you ask yourself why you watched it all.
Only to find out she hated it and didn't leave because she thought I liked it.
I would have given this a rating of 2 or 3 but you know.
It keeps jumping from one character to another.
This makes things very confusing.
I have never wanted to leave during a movie but I wanted to leave after 15 or 20 minutes of this one.
Far far away.
Jim if you are reading this stay away from the guys that made this movie.
Then it starts showing him as the character in the book he is reading.
The only reason I didn't it because my mother and I went to see it and I thought she liked it.
I would deffenitly rent this instead of buy it.
The story starts out VERY slow.
I was so excited about this movie because it is very differen't from most of his other movies.
Then when you find out what actually happened.

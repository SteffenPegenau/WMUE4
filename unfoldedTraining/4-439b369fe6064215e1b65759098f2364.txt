After a week, no lower back pain.
Pad still works very good.
Menopause.
I am dry on pad side.
bought another for sister and her husband.
I took the pad off and the pain started again.
We don't toss and turn anymore at night.
My mother suggested I flip pad to the smooth side because the cones were too aggressive for my back.
Excellent price.
This bad definitely FORCED our backs into position and after two nights and getting up in the morning crackling, our backs was amazingly better.
I put a one inch mattress cover on top of the 2 inch foam pad.
Pad back on.
It also helps me not suffer from sweat so much.
Very good product.
Unbelievable.

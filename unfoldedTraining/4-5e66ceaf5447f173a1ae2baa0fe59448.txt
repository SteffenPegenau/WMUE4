I WASN'T FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE BONUS TRACK.
STILL, I LIKED THIS ALBUM.
THE REMAKE OF THE OLDIES CLASSIC "YOU'VE LOST THAT LOVIN' FEELIN'" IS OUT OF PLACE ON THIS RECORD.
"REMEMBER MY NAME" IS A CATCHY CLASSIC LEGS DIAMOND EFFORT.
"COME WITH ME", "TRAGEDY", & "MAN AT THE TOP" CLOSE OUT THE L.P., AND ALL 3 ARE LEGS DIAMOND TO THE HILT.
THE MATERIAL IS NOT AS STRONG AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN.
NOT ONE OF THEIR BEST ALBUMS, CONSIDERING THEIR FIRST 2 WERE TOTALLY AWESOME.
OVERALL I RECOMMEND THIS CD BECAUSE IT DOES CONTAIN SOME CLASSIC LEGS DIAMOND MATERIAL.
"HELP WANTED" IS A LOVE SONG THATS JUST O.K.
"THE UNDERWORLD KING" RANKS UP THEIR WITH THEIR PREVIOUS EFFORTS.
"MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE" LAGS.
ACCUSTICALLY BRILLIANT, WITH THE SONG PICKING UP THE PACE TOWARDS THE END.
"MIDNIGHT LADY" IS NOT A STRONG PIECE, BUT A GOOD SONG IN ITSELF.
DEFINETLY HOT STUFF.
"CHICAGO" IS GOOD OLD TIME ROCK AND ROLL.
SO LETS START WITH THE OPENER.

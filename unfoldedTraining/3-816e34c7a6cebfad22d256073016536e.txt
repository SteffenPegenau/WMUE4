Hey Robert, you Idiot!
Jeeze, give me a break!
Dave's versions of all of these songs, have become fond memories, in their own right.
That, and you just don't hear a whole lot of Louis Prima nowadays.
In fact, yes, many people do associate Just a Gigalo/I Ain't Got Nobody with Diamond Dave, far more than they do Louis Prima & Co. cause, guess what?
This is a cool, 4 "Cover"-song EP.
Dave's version flat out blows Louis' away!
.
Its not Awesome, but it is very decent.
I suppose you feel that Hendrix ripped off Dylan with All Along the Watch Tower & the Beatles ripped off Chuck Berry with Roll Over Beethoven.
A few of the Original Beach Boys even did guest, back-up vocals on the California Girls "Cover"!
.
The songs on this album are "Covers" you Moron!
Dave did not rip off Louis Prima or the Beach Boys!
If they were cool enough to sing back-up, how can you call it a Rip-Off???

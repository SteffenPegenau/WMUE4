I absolutely love Buffy.
When I purchased it though, I was extremely disappointed.
Third is the features which I won't even bother with.
being shot in 16mm.
This is due to the ep.
It's the coolest show ever.
I was so excited when I heard that the complete first season was coming to DVD.
In America, things are sure running slow!!
I recommend that you put the DVD's in a cd holder and not use the package.
Second is the packaging.
Anyway, besides all this, the episodes are fantastic, just no the DVD or the quality.
Not to mention how scratched up they get.
Finally, how come in the UK, four seasons are already out on DVD for Buffy, and 2 for Angel?
They are horrible.
First of all, the picture on the three DVD's suck!
When I opened the DVD package, the second DVD kept fall out of the package slot.

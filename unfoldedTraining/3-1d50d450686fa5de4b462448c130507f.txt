:)
I think they did awesome on Tasslehoff, and not too bad with Tanis.
3 hours would have done Autumn twilight more justice.I watched it like 3 times, and know I'll watch it again.
It's nice to see this story animated.
I'll just have to be content with it.
1st one would have been up to defeating Onyx and seeing the fire over Solace.
I think the one major mistake was to give more details than necessary in this movie.
2nd one would have been the rest.
Only 2 characters that really stood out, with Raistlin coming third.
Oh well.
Been waiting for something like this for over 2 decades... remember reading these books when they first came out in the 80's, and hoping for something like this.Ok, they deviated a bit, and some focus on characters is lacking.
Some things we where not really supposed to notice until book 2.
Even though I cringe at some parts of the movie.
Like it, and hate it.
That Movie should have been split in 2.

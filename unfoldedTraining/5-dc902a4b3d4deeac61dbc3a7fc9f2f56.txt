LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT, JAMES MURPHY, GUITAR GOD, WAS LET GO TO LET WHO BACK IN THE BAND?
THIS ALBUM HAS THE FLAMES OF HELL RIDING ON ITS HEELS.
I WANT THIS ALBUM PLAYED AT MY FUNERAL.
THIS ALBUM IS SO INTENSE.
I STILL JAM IT TO THIS VERY DAY, AND I'VE HAD THE ALBUM SINCE '91.
!
THE ALBUM IS JUST FLAT OUT AWESOME.
ANYWAY, THIS IS THE BEST CD OBITUARY HAS EVER WRITTEN, RECORDED, AND RELEASED.
HE DID NOT SAVE THIS ALBUM, HE JUST IMPROVED IT.
OH NO, SAY IT AIN'T SO!
YES MY FRIENDS, ALLEN WEST WAS NOT ON THIS ALBUM, IF HE WAS, WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
BUT LET ME JUST SAY THAT JAMES MURPHY HAS TAKEN THIS ALBUM TO NEW HEIGHTS.
I WANT TO BE BURRIED WITH A COPY OF THIS CD SO SATAN AND I CAN JAM TOGETHER.
HIS MASTERY OF THE GUITAR MAKES ALLEN WEST LOOK SO BAD, SO, SO BAD.
ROCK ON!!!!!!

Nobody returns my calls!!
I spoke to Jose in customer service on Nov. 16th and was given a warranty repair number.
He was extremely helpful and assured me my repairs would be done immediately.
It doesn't bode well.
As of today's date, 1/16/2008, I have still not heard a word from Keyspan regarding my two repairs.
Beware!!!
The application is terrific, unfortunately, we're rough on the remote and the two purchased in March 2007 need repair.
I have purchased three of these for my business.
I have been unable to reach a live person.
Now the phone just rings and rings.
I have not heard a thing!!!
I have left messages on Jose's voice mail, the main voice mail, and I have emailed numerous times.
I have yet to hear from anyone regarding the status of my repairs.
I returned two remotes, and they were received in-house by Keyspan on Nov. 21st.

"After all those many, many readings, I still love it, too!
On trips, my husband and I would recite it from memory to soothe her as we drove.
.
I bought this book for my daughter thirteen years ago.
"I am a bunny, my name is Nicholas.
.
.
Today we're ordering a copy for her cousin's new baby!
.
I live in a hollow tree .
She's thirteen years old now; her beloved book is safely packed away for her children someday, but my daughter still lovingly recites the entire book to me every now and then .
Another generation needs to enjoy this lovely book.
and it's still one of her very favorite childhood books.
She loved it then and asked for me to read it to her every night for years.

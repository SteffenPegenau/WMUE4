BUT...what is up with the buttons and scroll knob?
It is cumbersome.
And I have yet to find a way to stop playback other than turning it off.
It works well and I do like it.
Very poor design.
And it does lock up rather easily as well.
It has happened to me twice in one month.
I quickly had to pay to replace them.
They warn you that it might and how to fix it...but why should it...and so often.
OH...and the case that covers the face is very annoying.
I like that you can create and revise playlists so easily on your PC and they convert to the player well.
That is odd.
The front panel does pop off rather easily.
You are constantly popping it open to make any changes to the songs being played.
This being my first MP3 player, I have nothing to compare it to.
The software works well and is quickly learned.
They make absolutely no sense.
BUT, the earphones are the worst design I have seen in my life.
Great memory and storage though.

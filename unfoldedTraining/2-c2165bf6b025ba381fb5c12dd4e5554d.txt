I should have passed it up.
I was so disappointed.
If you leave food intact in a warm climate it will grow mold, some deadly.
I sent mine back for refund.
the grinding basket had white mold on it.
Clean everything for sure.
When the juicer arrived it looked clean and perfect.
It had white mold all over the main food processing area.
I thought this was a deal to good to pass up and I was right.
I would be careful before using these used machines.
Upon inspection it was sticky and not clean at all.
It did come with a book and other parts but the bottom line is that it isn't reconditioned at all.
It has crud stuck on the outside of the switch area and was sticky to the touch.
Its someone Else's boxed up garage sale grab bag special.
It definitely had not been cleaned or "reconditioned".

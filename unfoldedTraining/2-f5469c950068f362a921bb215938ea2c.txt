I set them to dry overnight on a chair.
The problem is, I wore them once and made them slightly dirty.
I bought these shoes in white for a holiday.
I figured I am going to wash them.
They were comfortable and the right size.
I wake up in the morning to see and now instead of white pair shoes, I had a rusty pair of shoes.
It looked like they were now clean.
I washed them from the top and inside with plain water.
What a shame to throw out $50.
Have to throw them out.
It looks like there was some chemical in the shoes that came out when they were washed.
The shoes should come with a warning that you can't wash these shoes.
I now can't wear them anywhere.
What a mistake!!!
Very disappointed.On the positive side, I looked really nice in them during the holiday while they were clean :)
There is some sort of rust all over the shoes.

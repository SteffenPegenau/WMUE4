Yet they actually held the city for two years.
Not 1612 trying to encite anti-Polish propoganda to peddle a new "Soviet" styled Russian holiday.
(der'mo: Russian for crap)
Unicorns?
Yes.
The only thing they got right was the Polish Winged Hussars were the best cavalry Europe ever produced!
Anyone who knows Russian History (not the other reviewers) from Ivan the Terrible to Stalin know otherwise.
Poles are depicted as murderous barbarians.
Biased?
If your ignorant of history then you'd like it.
The movie takes artistic licence with real events.
GMAFB!
I am Polish American whose ancestors were Winged Hussars and fought in the Polish-Muscovite wars.
Otherwise watch Ogniem i Mieczem for a historical action/adventure movie.
Polish troops are thrown back from Moscow.

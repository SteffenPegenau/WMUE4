Underneath you will see a black box with 4 screws - undo.
Use the paper clip, opened, to clean out the holes in the heater.
Lift up and undo the 5 screws on the bottom.
You don't have to be particularly handy to fix it.
You need a screw driver, a pair of pliers and a paper clip.
But when I went to use it for only the second time the sprayer wouldn't work - a frequent complaint I understand.
I was really happy with the way it cleaned.
As others have stated - it works well when it works.
Pull the top up.
Underneath the cover is heater box.
Release the clamps holding the plastic tubes with the pliers and gently remove the tubes.
Unplug the machine.
You will see what is causing the problem.
It did not take long at all.
I especially liked the turbo brush.
Take the four screws from the top out.
You don't need to disconnect the wires.

This record kicks!
And they call themselves SKID ROW?
New guy on vocals?
Again, every single track is great.
Every song is a hightlight... but the best (for me at least) are "Ghost", "Born A Beggar", "Thick is the Skin", "Mouth of Voodoo" and yes, the punky "I Remember You Two".
!
Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
SURE, but don't go crying "sellout".
Sebastian who??
This gives me relief that there still are true artists out there who can, and do, make great music.
Highly Recommended!!
YOU BETCHA!!
Absolutely no filler here!
If it didn't say "Skid Row" on the cover it would probably go platinum... it's THAT good!
This is definitely in the top five rock releases of the year!
Kinda modern sounding?
YES.
Really!
It has not left the player since day one!
Oh... and go check 'em out live... yes, Johnny (the NEW voice of Skid Row) can belt out the classics too!

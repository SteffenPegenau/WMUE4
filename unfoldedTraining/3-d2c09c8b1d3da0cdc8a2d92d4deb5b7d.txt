You'll be thorugly disappointed.
Everythin has changed for the worst.
Instead of this deep meaning they go for something like Duddits is really an alien.
What happened to the big "Duddits is our Dreamcatcher ending?"
I know I was.
What is this crap?
It rocked.
But as soon as the film nears the end everything falls apart.
Kind of makes me wonder wheteher Kasdan even read the ending.
Okay, September rolls around and I immeadiately purchase this film, first day.
So, in waiting I read the book.
And when I watch, I nod for the first hour or so, not a bad adaption.
My advice, if you have to se the movie, don't read the book first.
This film is all I've been thinking about for months.
I'd been waiting for this movie ever since they kicked me out of the theater because I didn't have parental guidance.

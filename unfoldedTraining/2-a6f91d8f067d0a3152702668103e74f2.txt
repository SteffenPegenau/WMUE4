The story in the beginning was great.
Now she returns to collect teeth in revenge and spite.
The movie virtually fell apart.
The movie's main character was introduced.
One day, when children mysteriosuly disappear she is blamed and is executed.
The Idea is a beautifully told urban legend.
They truly ruined this.
Any child that looks at her face dies.
But one day she falls victim to a fire, which severely burns her face so She begins to wear a mask.
It was sad.
The general idea of an kindly old woman exchanging teeth for coins in the 1800s is good.
It was not scary at all.
This story was good.
They didn't take advantage of it.
We learned that as a grown man he was still afraid of the dark.
Then something went wrong.
Darkness falls' whole story rests on the fact that at one time in our life (preferab;y childhood) we were afraid of the dark.

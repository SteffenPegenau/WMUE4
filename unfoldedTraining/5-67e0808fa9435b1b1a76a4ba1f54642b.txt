For health reasons I don't walk outside but use the treadmill.
I am planning on giving it as a Christmas gift to several girlfriends.
I have had several pedometers in the past.
ETC.
I ordered it and couldn't wait.
It was the easiest thing to set up.
This is great.
And it is always within 50 steps of what I figure.
The fact that you can put it in you pocket is such a plus.
Just in passing one day my girlfriend mentioned this model.
They don't last long, they are a pain to set up.
And it is very accurate.
I love the fact that it has the arobic and normal steps.
I mean I wear it all day.
And it registers those steps as arobic.

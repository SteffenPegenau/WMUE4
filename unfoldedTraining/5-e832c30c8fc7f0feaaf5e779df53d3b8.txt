That day comes, but unfortunetly he is wounded in battle.
This innocent prince then becomes a blood-thirsty king.
Bowen gets angry thinking it is the dragons fault.
This is one of the best films that have been made.
The dragon (named Draco) does and makes the boy promise never to be evil like his father.
He goes on a spree killing dragons and later realizes that it isn't the dragons fault.
Each of them are at truly top notch perfomences.
When the prince's father die he is to become king.
The knight, Bowen takes him to a dragon to heal him.
He then teams up with Draco the Dragon to put the king out of power.
The dragon looks real and the music is stunning.
I almost cried at the end and so will most of you.
Dennis Qauid, Sean Connery, and Pete Postelthwait are dynamite in this movie.
The movie is sad and very touching.
It's about a knight who is training a young prince to become a king.

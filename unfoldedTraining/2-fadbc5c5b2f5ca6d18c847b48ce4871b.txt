The sound is what it is.
Not as bad as other say, but bad.
The story setup was not there.
I am curious.
I have seen worse.
The plot...?
This was direced by Fred Williamson.
You wonder what it's all about and then once you know, you still have a hard time knowing what it is.
If you ever thought that there was no such thing as bad directing, look at most decent to great films, then get this.They tried to relive some of Richard roundtree's Shaft persona, but this movie sucks.
What was Jim Kelly's last film?
I wonder how much they got paid.To the guy who said that he was an actor in the film, what part did you play?
The dialuoge is hardly there.
The worst part has to be the directing.
I was wondering where that trailer aired.All of thew stars must have been out of work at that time in order to think that this would work.
I bought this(yes) because I wanted to see what Jim Kelly and other looked like goin into the 80's.
I see...The picture quality is very clear and clean.

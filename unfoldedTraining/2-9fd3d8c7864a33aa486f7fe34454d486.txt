This is what I was saying to myself:Ok.
Get the gist.
Ok.
I didn't say HOW TO write a good story....
No, but really, I had it about 400 pages ago.Honestly, if you're into the series, go ahead and pick up a copy, or borrow one, as I did.
Unfortunately, this book was mediocre.
At least I hope.... Naked Empire, although some cool stuff happens, is lacking in good writing, and full of explainations about how, as cincibookworm puts it, dogma on how bad collectivisim is.
I don't know what happened, but it appears that Goodkind has become more interested in writing about philosophy and sociology, and has forgotten to write a good story.
I see.
I get it.
I get it.
I get it ... collectivism can be bad.
Skim it.
Ohhh ...
I just said he's leaving it out.
The first 5 books were great ... but then Faith of the Fallen, Pillars of Creation, and now Naked Empire are here.
And pray for the 9th book... :-/
Read it.
No really.

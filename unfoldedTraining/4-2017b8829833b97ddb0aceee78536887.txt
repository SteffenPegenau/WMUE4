The mother is hiding a secret from her family which causes chaos.
Now I'm not going to ruin the movie for you and tell you what makes the movie sad.
But when I saw it, it was actually more of a drama.It was about a man and a womanwho are engaged to be married.
It's more drama.
When they get there, the family doesn't give Sarah Jessica Parker(girlfriend)an exact warm welcome.
But the woman has to meet his family.
The brother likes her.
This movie was such a good movie.
They are actually really mean to her.
Yup, this was a real tear-jerker.
And alot of stuff happens besides that.
And she just feels really unwelcome.
but this movie isn't really a comedy either.
The father doesn't know what to do.
But from the preveiws, it looked like it was a comedy.
The sister doesn't.
I do recommend it to anyone who likes a sad, but great film.

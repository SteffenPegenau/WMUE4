Careful.
Lesson learned but can't you hit a great deal once in a while??
Unscrew the bottom to put in some batteries and you'll see that the threads barely match up.
There are plastic 'washers' where we are usually used to seeing rubber O-Rings for weather sealing.
This has nothing to do with the seller, of course.
Be careful!
I should have realized that, at this price, the product would be mediocre.
Next time I'll have to spend more and get something that can handle as hard as I play.
That's my take on these lights.
Yuck.
If you're military this is not the light for you.
Good on them!
However, damn this is a cheap little flashlight.
You'll strip the threads if you aren't careful and render it useless.Same goes when putting a red lens on it.
at $4 a piece you just have to be careful.
Having said that, the seller got this to me in a very fast manner.

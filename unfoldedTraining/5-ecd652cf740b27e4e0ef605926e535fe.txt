Color coded wiring and inputs make this the easiest system to assemble to date.
Dollar for Dollar superior to Bose.
No better THIB,not by a long shot.
Quite frankly, JBL didnt "dumbdown" for the home theatre market.
JBL supplies half of all recording studios.
The solid, Heavy constructionmakes this a keeper for many years.You can feel confident its equally a stereo and Home Theatre system...But dont tell JBL.
Worth the price for the tuner alone.
I beleive this is the most powerful and clean consumer amp.
Another nice thing is the absence of stupid,glitzy featuresthat never get used,and only distractfrom the real issue.
Ive ever heard.
500 wattsAmazing System.
Im hearing things on old analog recordings,unheard before.

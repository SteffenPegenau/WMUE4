Plug in the router: to the computer, to the modem & to the wall.
Guess I'll get a third Netgear wireless.
Turn off your computer & modem.
Turn on the router.
All done.
Make any of the adjustments Cyberdesi addresses now.
In that order, per directions.
Maybe I should buy stock?
There is some good stuff in the review by Cyberdesi.
?
Well, it's wise to fire up net access & double check.
Turn on the modem.
I just set up my second one (a gift to a friend).
David McCulloch's review is a good recap of my experience except I think David overstates how hard it is.
Turn on the computer.
It isn't obvious to me how to make it any easier to do.Now I hear we are getting cable at the condo at the beach.

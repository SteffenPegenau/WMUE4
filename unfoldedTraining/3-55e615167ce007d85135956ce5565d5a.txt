When I locked down the valve, the pressure dropped.
So, I guess the problems was the battery after all.
Finally, yesterday, it wouldn't inflate tire at all.
But after a year, it became less reliable.
I had it for about three years (early 2007), used it maybe 4-5 times a year.
I bought it to keep in the car trunk.
It was a 50-50 proposition whether it would refill my tire.
So, in my case, the battery was not the problem but the pump section just wouldn't work right.
Air pressure was inconsistent from one use to the next, weak-to-fine, gauge would often stay at zero.
[Updated 2012]This spring, just as I was about to clean out the trunk and throw it out, I had a thought and decided to try it with the car adapter.
When it worked, it was fine but reliability was the issue.
Surprise, surprise, it worked fine.
Okay, it's kind of an obvious test I guess.
Maybe this will help someone.
Recharged it regularly as recommended.

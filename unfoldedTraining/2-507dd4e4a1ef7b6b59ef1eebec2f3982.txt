It started as one small area and was not a big deal.
We had noticed this ~ 9 months into ownership.
We have had this unit for approximately 4 years.
We have noticed that after one item is toasted, the subsequent item will not toast adequately on one or even 2 cycles.
Poor alloy, poor us.
This likely will be our last Cuisinart product.
The toaster shuts off too quickly.
Now however, the rust is most everywhere on the pan itself.
Our ownership experience has left a lot to be desired.
It functioned well for about 1 year.
Additionally, I believe the toasting setting relies on reaching a certain internal temperature and then stops the cycle.
Now, we are at the lightest setting and still it is almost too dark.
We consequently have adjusted the desired setting lighter and lighter.
You must toast it minimum 3 times.Lastly, and most disappointingly, the included pan rusts!!!
We noticed the toaster setting seemed to progressively toast darker and darker.

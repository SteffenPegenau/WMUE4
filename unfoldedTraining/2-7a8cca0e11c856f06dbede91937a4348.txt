I ended up having to buy a small toaster oven from Target to do the two jobs I was told this one would do.
It's the same thing as the "oven" with a wire rack.
It's as if you'd microwaved it and then tried to dry it out in an oven overnight.
Live and learn.
It has to be dialed for the times, you can't just punch in 3min 30 seconds.
I didn't want to pay to send it back, but should have!
A broiler element comes on from the inside top and within 3 minutes will turn your slices of bread to hardened bricks.
Don't buy the combo machines, they can't do it all.
This oven looks great, is a little big.
Not the worst thing.
The bread is not edible.
I could have bought a nice looking, well made microwave for a lot less money and the same toaster oven.
The worst is it's only a microwave.
The "oven" is the same broiler element only and will also ruin any dinner rolls you might have put in a small toaster oven.
The "toaster" is a joke.
Big mistake.

At first I almost turned it off as I felt so sorry for the old lady.
It is interesting to see her stick to her guns in all situations.
My theory with women in power is that they are more principled and more likely to be a hard liner because they have a safety net.
She was never one to form a coalition.
Married women can always return home.
This was an interesting moving.
She was very black and white.
Very well done.
Chauvinist sure but true.
But over the course of the movie I began to empathizes with her.
I am glad I stuck with it.Great leadership points here.
Men dont have that option.
As the movie shows the men are more interested in preserving their careers and don't have the luxury of principals.
It is an old boy network for a reason.
In her case she had a supportive husband at home.
She rocked the boat and won...for a while.Over all a very interesting enjoyable movie.

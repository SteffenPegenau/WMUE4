Better yet, steal his car and run him over with that.
That's the beauty of GTA 3.
Car jack a big rig and run him or her down on the streets.
Pretend that's him on the screen and make him road pizza.
Not many games can offer that, but GTA 3 pulls it off perfectly with great graphics and gameplay to boot.
Go get a job from a mob boss for some extra dough.
Mad at your boss?
Have fun!
The police and politians won't agree, but Screw Em'!!
!
This has to be considered one of the greatest games of the century.
Angry that a cop pulled you over coming home?
GTA 3 is what I call the perfect "come home from work" game.
Pop this game in and beat people to a bloody pulp on the sidewalk.
Example, Had a hard day at work?
Do whatever you feel like doing.
Feeling more constructive rather than DEstructive?

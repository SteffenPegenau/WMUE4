I remember the feeling I had waiting for the Crown of swords to come out.
It is not like the first few books when everyone was together or in a few groups.
It just does not seem the same anymore.
The book came out a few weeks before finals, so I had about 2 days to read it.
I have to admit, I felt a bit let down.
Maybe the next book will make me feel differant.....
Just a bit mind you.
It could have been so much more.
I do not really get that feeling any more.
I really hate to give this book only 3 stars.
I understand that it is difficult to make plot line progress when all of your main players are off on thier own.
I still loved the book and the series.
I guess it could be me getting older or the story getting old.
That feeling you used to get as a little kid when you went to bed on christmas eve.
Still, even considering this I still want to know how it ends.

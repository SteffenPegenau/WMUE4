99 Critical Shots of Pool contains all this information and more.This is not for the beginner.
This book assumes you already have the basics behind you.I don't recommend this book.Buy a tip pick instead.
A beginning pool player is not going to follow it.
The examples on the 3 and 4 rail kicks lack in quantity.
I am not the best player and I'm not the worst player.
I can make shots and banks.
Or some chalk.
The fomula given is usable.
I was looking for a book that gave a solid kicking system.This book tells you nothing you cannot find out from another good player at a hall.
Or a soda.
The other information in this book can be found in other books which are better written.
If you don't know english or have a good stroke, you will not benefit from this.
The illustrations lack variations in shots and explanations on how to make a reasonable adjustment.
Unfortunately, it is not explained too well.
I am a league player rated a 5.

And the little plot there is, doesn't make any sense!
There is virtually no plot!
Who enjoys that?
Yes, the special effects were amazing- especially for the time it was made.
I thought I was going to go crazy!
So we find it very difficult to appreciate slow-paced movies.
I really pity those who sat through the whole thing in a theater.
It requires a great deal of patience.
And I've watched a lot of movies.
Not me.
I really thought I was going to go out of my mind.I suppose it's because in 2007, we're so accustomed to a lot of fast-paced and action-packed movies.
The whole movie moves soooo slowly!!
Luckily I had the ability to fast-forward.
I don't have that kind of patience.
But oh my gosh!!
This has to be the most BORING movie of all time.
It just leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions.
In my opinion, this movie is a complete waste of time.

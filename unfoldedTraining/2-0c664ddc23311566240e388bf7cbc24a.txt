If your body can tolerate it, it does relieve pain.
Up to this point I was getting increasingly tired each day.
I had quit taking the ALA the day before the migraine.
This was under a Dr's advise.
From what I have read, I think it was playing with my blood sugar level as well as my thyroid medication.
But, on day 13 I woke up confused and couldn't remember how to take my medicine.
The day of my migraine, I was so tired I slept all day.
On day 21 I started with a mild headache.
ALA took away my pain in about a week.
Two days later it was a migraine.
My Dr. told me to stop taking this.
I took 600 mg of Alpha Lipoic Acid a day for 23 days.
That happened once.
It was to treat burning mouth which is my side affect from acid reducers.
It took 5 days before most of my energy was back.

Well, a new Def Leppard album?
This album never takes off.
Sign me up!
This album was so syrupy-sugar sweet that I thought I'd get a pimple from listening to it.
4 letter word?
Come ON!
Weak all the way through.
I guess they're trying to get in on the quick and snappy sweet world of boy band music.
even if their last few albums were a little weak, I was still pleased to see a new offering.
But what about the songs?
That is so L-A-M-E.
And what about all the songs about LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE?
Wow, you'd think they were love starved 12 year old girls.
It leaves you wondering what happened to the band.
Man, was I in for a shock.
The only song that STARTS to rock dies as soon as it reaches the chorus.
DO NOT BUY THIS.
Oh, the sharp production is still there, the performances are good and the sound is great.
K-I-S-S?

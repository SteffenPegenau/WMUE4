Like the title says, here's my pick of the top 10 worst sequels of all time:1.
Spider Man 3Avoid this trash @ all costs, and just buy the original with Brendan Fraser.
Shrek the 3rd9.
You'll LOL!
Crocodile Dundee 26.
The only good thing about this retched sequel was the opening animated cartoon opening, that's it!
George of the Jungle 22.
Wayne's World 28.
Speed 2: Cruise Control5.
Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House3.
Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles7.
Stuart Little 310.
Caddyshack 24.
I remember watching the GOTJ cartoon on Cartoon Network back in the 90s, and seeing the 1st George of the Jungle movie when I was 2 years old at the movies, it was the first film I saw in a theater and I laughed my "coconuts" off and sang the theme song when my parents drove me home.
After hearing that a sequel was in the works, I wasn't too enthusiastic and knew that it would be bad.

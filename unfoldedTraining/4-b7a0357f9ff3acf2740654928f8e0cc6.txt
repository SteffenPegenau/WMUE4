You will need a $300 antenna for that.
Great price for this.
They also let you cancel off season.
The satelite weather is excellent but pricey through xm at $50 a month.
A visoin card is key for upper level funtions and routing.
I added a vision card, satelite weather and a Fuel flow sensor.
I also have it hooked to my Marine radio which will transmit and receive coordinates.
The Fuel flow sensor was a huge pain to wire but it is nice to have.
But there are two lower tiers.
No complaints.
I have had this for almost 2 years.
The sonar works great except for high speeds but that is an issue with my boat hull design I believe.
Xm radio controls from unit with weather.
Great visiblity in sunlight.
It works perfectly.
I have taken my boat to the bahamas twice.

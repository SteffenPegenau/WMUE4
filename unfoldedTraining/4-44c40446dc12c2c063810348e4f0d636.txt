I like the elastic support, which my previous support belt didn't have.
Now, I'm pregnant with my second baby, and needed another support band for working out.
I am very pleased with this band.
I purchased a very wide support belt with velcro.
This band is so comfortable.
The medium fits very comfortably and I think it will be ok for the remainder of the pregnancy.
It's perfect in width.
I'm currently weighing in at about 160 lbs.
As others have stated in their previous posts, had I gone with the small, it probably would have been too tight and not lasted my entire pregnancy.
I am 6 months pregnant and have a medium band.
You can wear it under clothes without it being too noticeable.
Sometimes I forget that its even there.
I also like the fact that it's not too wide.
It was extremely uncomfortable during workouts because of it's stiff structure.
In my first pregnacy, I found myself needing additional support during my workouts.
I through it away after my son was born.

As others may have said "Tattle Teller" Is ridiculous.
It is not horrendous to the point it makes me want to die but its not great.
First up, if you wantin the best rap album in history, DO NOT pick this up.
Love My Style uses a sample from Britney Spears Toxic as moronic as that sounds but its a pretty good track.
Im so high is one of the best songs ive ever heard.
Curious with Joe is Mostly singing, not one of my personal fav.s Drama Setter is simply amazing.
It shouldve went platinum, yes but no further.
I suggest you do the same.
By far the best on the album.
The next single "I Know You Dont Love Me" Is kinda dumb, 50s boring-ass hook sucks.
Live by the gun is a nice track.
So seductive is great, nice club banger.
I didn't buy the album but I burned it.
Dear Suzie is Fckin stupid.
project princess is decent.

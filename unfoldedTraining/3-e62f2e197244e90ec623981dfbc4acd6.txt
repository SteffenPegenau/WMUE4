When I went to shave today.
You got be kidding me!
If I choose to keep this its going to cost me a lot!UPDATE The price of the blades are unreal!!!
Some it just teared out.
And it worked great on day 1 and 2.
However on day three Sunday I didn't leave the apartment so I didn't shave.
It would cut some and leave others.
I had to shave twice just to get a clean shave!!!
I used aGillette Mach3 Shaving System, 1 systemfor two years until It finally broke on me last Friday.So I bought this at a local Walmart due to its excellent ratings here.
Very close and smooth and with less irritation then my old Mach3.
It had trouble cutting the stubble that formed over day and a night.
I have given up on this razor and bought a new Gillette Mach3.And on closer inspection its actually doing a better job on my lower lip.
And the refills are expensive $25 for 6 retail?
plus Ive only used 3 times and the blade looks like it will need to be replaced soon!
And They last a bought a week.

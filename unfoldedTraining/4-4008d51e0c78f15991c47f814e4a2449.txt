Don't be embarassed to own a No Limit cd.
Check out song number 6 with snoop dogg.
You can tell they got that street credential..and they show it.
I know gangsta rap, and this entire cd shocked me...for real.
I didn't know what to think when I first saw it.
Get this album.
Go get it!!
Be surprised at song number 4, a tupac remake from "2pacalypse now".
They've got crazy flows and amazing cuts all throughout the album.
Plus, number 10 is one of the realest rap songs ever compiled.
This album surprised me.
!
I figured it would have the classic No Limit beats and productions.
The production on this cd blew my mind.
When I herd that song, I knew Kane & Abel were for real.
This is one of the best bet layouts in any song.
But, Kane & Abel have distinct vocals that set them apart from other rappers.
Kane & Abel come off harder on this track than I ever thought they could.
A real rap fan will appreciate this album.

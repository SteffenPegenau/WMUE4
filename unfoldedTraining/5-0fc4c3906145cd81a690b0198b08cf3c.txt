I got my picture taken with Jesse.
I love Dreamstreet.
My best friend and I met them at the mall.
I have a picture of that.
My best friend got all of them to sign her CD.
My best friend and I made a sign that said We Love Jesse and made him blush!
I don't really have one favorite song on it though.
Also I would reccomend their album The Biggest fan which is the sound track to the movie The Biggest fan.
I am sad that they broke up.
Some of them are going solo though.
Jesse said nothing to the other girls but he said that he liked my jacket to me.
I love this CD!
They were funny.
I only got Matt and Jesse (my favorite) to sign mine.
They signed my best friend's and my CDs.
I would reccomend this CD to any Dreamstreet fan.

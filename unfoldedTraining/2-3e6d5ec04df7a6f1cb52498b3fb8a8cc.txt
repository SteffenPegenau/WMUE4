Heck, every DORM at the Pacific Northwest school I attended was full of sex, booze, drugs, and partying too--you didn't need to join the Greek system to pass out drunk every weekend!

Of course not.
College?
350+ pages on something we all know is going on.
Go to college."
There's a famous saying: "Want an education?

Go to a library.
Want to party?

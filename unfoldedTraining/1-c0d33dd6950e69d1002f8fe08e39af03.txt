?I just watched No Tell Motel last night and that had all sorts of people talking about how slow it was.
And upside-down monster thing.
They would have turned this off in 10 minutes.I'm glad I didn't pay for this.
That's supposed to be scary when you chomp your teeth like a wind up pair of plastic teeth?
I guess he's supposed to look cool cause he has shades on.
That we can forgive.
I found it entertaining enough to want to get to the end.

Really?
What we can't forgive is how you fight with the girl and you manage to get her hand but somehow, with your mouth right there, you can't pull her in and get a chunk of her.
Special effects have left you far behind.
It's freekin slow and there's nothing scary until the last 20 minutes.
And the shark hybrid guy.
The daughter is the only one that can act.
But that doesn't help to distract you from the 5 fat chins he has.
One's a fat lard that's...

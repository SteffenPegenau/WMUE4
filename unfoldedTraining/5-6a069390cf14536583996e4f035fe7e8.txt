The ease of movements lets me know that I CAN do high impact and that I really need to bump of my workout.
It made Leslie sweat too LOL.
:^)If you like Leslie Sansone - this will be yet another favorite.
.
I can see myself easliy using it in the morning as well as in the evening as well.
People complain over and over about her music but I just want to work out with something that will keep me movingI can not say enough about this DVD.
The challenge is there to help not kill!
I loved it so much that I had to log right on and post this review.What I liked: It has low and high impact moves the entire time.
It is a wonderful workout for only 30 minutes .
It made me sweat and half the time of a full workout.
I actually purchased this DVD 2 months ago but I used it for the 1st time today!!!
The transition from high impact movement to jogging was good no great.
.
I did not feel like I had to catch up because I never missed a move.

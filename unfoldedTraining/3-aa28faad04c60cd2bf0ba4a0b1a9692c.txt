When you ask Q. pause.
Q's educate.
Statements generate resistance.
"why are you... Why do you feel a need to... What exactly are..." Don't defend, invite criticism abd advice.
SILENCE IS A GREAT WEAPON.
If Q'ed wait to answer people are uncomfortable in silence or ask for clarification, then wait.
Use questions instead of statements.
Look behind their position on the problem at hand and address it.
Recast personal attacks as an attack on the problem.
What can we do now to reach an agreement as quickly as possible?
Ask questions and pause.
If unreasonable propsal or an attack- the BEST THING is to sit and not say a thing.
Use it!
Q's generate A's.
Ask what's wrong with... What concerns them.
Silence is the best negotiating.

There's a tiny bit of vocal here and there, and an occasional riff that catches your attention for a moment, but for the most part, it sounds like the kind of indistinct "rave" track used in any club scene of any movie in the 1990s.
It's slightly pretty melodic trance, a bit of harder "darude" sounding stuff, but it just doesn't really get into your soul.

it is amazing to me that people loved this season.
Roger becoming an LSD freak.
so many bad episodes and storylines: Don's hallucination that he kills one of the many women he's bedded.
Harry having sex in his office with some Hari-Krishna woman.
i could go on and on...not sure whether Matthew Weiner lost his touch, is too full of himself at this point or what.
Pete's Metro-North affair.
Joan prosituting herself for Jaguar (and everyone except Don, who's not a good guy either, going along with it)."Bravo!"
but Season 5 of Mad Men just isn't very good.
exclaims Cooper when they get the business.
i've been a fan of Mad Men since day one, and Season 5 isn't good.
and not just bad by Mad Men standards.
kind of similar to a good band making a bad record.
remains to be seen if the show can recover...
yea, right.
give me a break.

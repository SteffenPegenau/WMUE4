But they really did cut corners to get this realeased.
But I went ahead and bought it anyways.
I have all of the other seasons.
I've taken them out 2 times and they are allready starting to skip.
And I really wish they put more effort into making them better.
I read them all before I purchased it.
I always wake-up in the middle of the night to those screens.
I had to put them into different cases.
Now the box just sits here with no discs in it.
I don't really care about the commentaries.
I expected so much more for the 20th anniversary.
I'm the biggest Simpsons fan ever.
I care about the cheap packaging.
I gave this dvd box set a 2 star rating, like tons of others.
They really rushed this set.
Also, I don't like the etch-a-sketch look alike pictures that grace the top of the episode selection pages.
It'll get thrown to the side to collect dust after while.
The discs just slide in cardboard slots.

That's 64 of these 1/2 oz bags each month.
I knew, but didn't take into consideration the high sodium - 275mg per 1/2oz bag - until recently.
I was originally drawn by the low carbs per serving bag.
I like that they are also Gluten-Free.
Be careful!
I hope it happens, soon.
A rep at the company told me they were working to cut the sodium content.
Plus, they grow on you.
I won't buy any more until they do.
I bought them by the box of 16 packs.
They are also available in 2 oz bags.
Literally.
The low carbs get you, but if you have a problem with sodium, realize the content is high!
I used "subscribe and save" and started buying 4 boxes of 16 - 1/2 oz bags, per month.
It's just too much sodium for a little bag and people should be aware of it.
I have been buying these "crunchy cheese snacks" in Classic White Cheddar for a couple of years.
The 1/2 oz bag says "1 g".

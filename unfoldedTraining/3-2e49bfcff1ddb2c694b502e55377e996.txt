Soul Coughing has gone pop.
The vocals sound like a chord arrangment.
I have to admit that I like to sing a long a little bit, but not usually to Soul Coughing albums.
Just listen to Monster Man, Circles and Blame.
It works.
Now the guitar work is bouncy and catchy and go are the lyrics.
I'm not saying it's a bad thing.
I love Ruby Vroom and Irresistible Bliss.
I may like the other two albums better, but they did do something new and pull it off well.
I do get a kick out of some of their new style.
Houston and $300 are good for driving to work in the mourning.
On tracks like "Bus to Beazlebub" and "Paint" Doughty had a lot of alternative chops and a white rapper thing going.
This one is very different.
Those are damn fine albums!
Monster Man, The Incubent and Pensacola are all weird.
But I miss the old Soul Coughing.
All in all: They did so many new things that aren't really Soul Coughing, but they did keep their obscerity.

Tech Support was a joke and won't respond to my email requests.
Good luck, but better yet learn from my misfortune.
PLUS it is even easier to install than the Netgear.
Router will not respond to the config IP address.
Maybe you will get a good one, but both a V1 and V5 have failed me.
I don't have time to argue with a tech support technician half way around the world when it is CLEARLY a hardware problem that they don't want to acknowledge.
Recommended it to a client.Mine died.
All I want is a router that works.
Easy setup, great connectivity.
I HAVE done this before.
Two netgear routers are trash.
Longevity for the Linksys will be determined, but the Netgear score is a big fat zero.
Router client bought is DOA.After 8 months the three year warranty is useless.
Started out great.
With one dying in service and one DOA, I bought a Linksys and it is a dream.

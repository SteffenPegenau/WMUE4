All the things that made Lonesome Dove so great just aren't present here.
They have nothing interesting to say and very little interesting to do other than suffer.
The first part of this book just recounts how everyone died in the intervening time.
I'm not particularly interested in watching people suffer.
I've never been more happy to end a book.
This isn't giving anything away but almost all the interesting surviving character from Lonesome Dove dies before Streets of Laredo even begins.
The lyricism, the poetry, the sense of wonder are gone.
Those things and all the interesting characters.
First let me say I loved Lonesome Dove.
I believe it's one of the best novels ever written.
This, on the other hand, is far from it.
The few left are the ones that don't talk much.
And that's the fun part.
It gets worse from there, much worse.
Reading about it either.

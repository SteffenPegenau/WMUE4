It incorparates sly vocals by Ray, with simple bass and some En Esch guitar work.
The rest of the cd however is rather disapointing.
The first track "Kicking Ass" is awesome.
Its slower, cruder and too experimental.
The next track "Me I Funk" is awesome at times.
Only get this if youre a big KMFDM fan, otherwise this might turn you off from them.
I think to really appreciate this record you have to realize where it was coming from.
They had little money for the real good equipment so thats where it shows on this recording.
Sascha Konietzko, En Esch and Raymond <PIG> Watts.
You have to hear it.
Track 5 "Itchy Bitchy" is hilarious.
With a punkish chorus, and screaming Sascha vocals, its not too bad musically, though it could of been a little shorter.
KMFDM started as a 'ultra heavy beat' industrial band.
Its probably one of those things where you have to get into a groove for the real feeling behind it.
The original KMFDM lineup is a classic.

I think is very good for teenagers or for English student.
This book is very good book.
but, this book's end part is so rapidly finish.
Hewas starded in the wilderness alone.
I think this book is the one of the best outdoor adventure story.
Brian's parents are wanted to divorce.
Brian knew about mother's cheating.
This part is only feel the lack of this book.
This book make reader to think about different from our normal life's situation.
I recommend to other ESL student.
But, when he was in the way to go his father, his plane crashed.
so, he wants to tell his father.
Because, this book is not to hard to read and it's very exciting story.
First time, he was very weak, but he became strong person.
He learned how to survive, make a fire, how to hunt, how to make shelter... Brian going to change his character.

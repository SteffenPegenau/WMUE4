Benzos are making complex and unique statements with All The King's Men" and "You're Forever An Hourglass."
Their music is dreamy and thoughtful.
They were very impressive.
Not so much "prog rock" as bringing musicianship back into music.
Like bands such as Secret Machines and Inouk, there is a new movement in music that is more progressive.
We will be looking back at this record at year's end and remembering the great experience.
I saw this band, Benzos, open up for Blonde Redhead in New York.
Musically they were advanced compared to the sort of bands that had come out of New York recently.
It is more subtle than many fashionable bands.
The producer has captured the live sound of the band.
Every song is a winner.
This music has some substance.
"It's Amiable" almost sounds like Radiohead.
The production on this record is very good.
This music needs to be listened to.

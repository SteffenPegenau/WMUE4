I have been reading V.C.
Books like Flowers in the Attic and My Sweet Audrina.
Andrews books I suggest you start with Flowers in the Attic and work your way down.
There were some good parts of the book.
But it was the same plot used over and over and over again.
If you are a novice to V.C.
You'll see how her writing style was fresh and full of wonder and not where it is: Reduced, Reused and Recycled.
When I read Rain I was deeply disappointed.
I would invade the bookstores to see if her new releases came out.
V.C.
Andrews must be rolling in her grave to see her pride and joy decline in such a droll fashion.
The people in the bookstore know me by name.
I agree with most of the reviewers that gave a poor rating on this book.
Andrews' books every since I was in junior high.
I did like the fact that the grandmother wasn't a cynical old witch and that she admired Rain's mother for bringing her up with morals.
What happen to the thrilling writing and the edge of your seat suspence.

The only other album I own is the self titled album.
I guess she can't sing operatic style.
It's getting harder to find bands like that anymore.
This album is okay, but, after hearing the whole thing I was bored.
I never even bothered with the albums where they decided to go techno-industrial or what ever that crap was.
I felt at times I was listening to Collide.
I remember the growls and beautiful voice of Liv.
Almost seems that they are trying to get into that Nu-Metal market and appeal to the younger crowd.
But they only put out an ep and thats it.
So..okay, but, nothing special.
The rest of the vocals are just boring and not uplifting at all.
Case in point..Eyes Without Face..great!!
I am always looking for the operatic sounds when I am looking for new music.
Seems like everytime you find one they only put out one album or one ep and then it's over.
The new female singer is way too poppy, her voice never changes on any of the songs.

Simon is a fairly outspoken man.
Then things get really bad.
He's the devil.
He denies Carl who by now has full blown AIDS & turns his back on everything & everyone he once loved & cherished.
He is in a relationship with Carl, gay, with a very real fear of getting AIDS.
Pretty dark but an interesting movie nontheless.
After much delay he is tested & finds he is HIV positive.
Would the devil try to trick or deceive you?
He has problems holding onto a job.
He becomes wildly sucessful, a national sensation.
Simon's first tasks is to become a gay bashing comedian delivering jokes written by the devil to overflow homophobic crowds.
Of course he would.
Sure enough the devil appears & agrees to make him HIV negative again.
But Simon must perform several task.
He marries his best friend, Muse, to complete his cover.
Of course, that works out badly.
In his anger, he writes letters to Satan for help.

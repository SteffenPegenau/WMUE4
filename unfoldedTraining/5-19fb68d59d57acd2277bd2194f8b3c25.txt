All these songs, break into something else as they go along.
World music sung in English never seems to have the impact on me.
If you've ever listened to Tool, this is what this sounds like in the structure of the song.
She's able to do that.
It is straight rock, soft, loud technique.
It's breathy and powerful.
The songs are constructed like soft and loud.
Like prog-metal.
There are many slow songs on this.
The singing is in Italian, wich is a very passionate language.
I mean, why listen to an Italian disc without it sung in Italian.
I like world music sung in the language of the countryl.
Breathy sexy and real screaming shrieky.
Very interesting listen, I'm glad I bought it.
Her voice goes from breathy to shrieky.
She does both really well.
The songs are basically straight rock with a little punk overtone.
Consoli has a really good voice, first of all.
This is a really good disc.

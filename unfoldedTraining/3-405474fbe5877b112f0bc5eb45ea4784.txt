How many times in a day can you tell someone they are the most beautiful girl in the world.
If you want real romance and to shed some tears give the book I named earlier by Patterson a try.
Hoping it was along the calibur of Suzannes Diary for Nicholas I rushed out to buy it on day one.
Or, better yet, read The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks.
I have read every book he has ever written and was surprised by this one.
Please!
For instance, when you read it, count how many times they use the name of the person they are talking to in conversations.
Dont get me wrong, I liked the book.
Now I wish I had borrowed it from a friend.
GAG!
It was not realistic to me.
Another thing was how repetitive the compliments were.
I realize it is a book of fiction but this book to me was over the top on some points.
Come back soon Alex Cross!
I had high hopes for this book.
When I am sitting talking to my husband, I dont use his name in every other sentence.
Notice I said liked.

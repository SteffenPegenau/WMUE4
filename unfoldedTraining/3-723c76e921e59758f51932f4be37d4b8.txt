NOWHERE.
Jason improved on his acting.
4.
The Red Ranger is one of the most horrible actors ever, but... this movie has some good points.
This movie was NOWHERE NEAR as awsome and incredible as the first one.
She was hilarious, a great villian.
Finally, the wilderness scene and the Megazord.
nuff'said.
6.
The soundtrack.
That's it, other elements in the movie are okay, yet, beware the Red Ranger and the weak plotline.
The villaness, Divatox.

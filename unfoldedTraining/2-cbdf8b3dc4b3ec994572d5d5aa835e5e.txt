10 minute black screen and silence before the credits role to fully ponder the master piece.
Colin Farell's been fake-tanning.
....a beautiful two and a half hr slideshow.
With heavy classical music overlay.
While showing Native Americans.
And snow.
Some people die.
General synopsis: Colin Farell's hair blows in the wind.
And trees.
Pochantas looks down coyly.
Batman arrives.
There's water.
Pocahantas's hair also blows.
Alot.
And sky.
The end.
Others have boils.

I don't have any other spin dvd's, so I can't compare this to any at home spin "class".
Just what the doctor ordered!
The music is the only thing that I didn't care for.
You get a great workout with the 40 lb flywheel!
Other than that, it is perfect.
I bought a Gold's Gym Cycle Trainer from my local Walmart for $267!
You spend a lot of time standing and hovering over the seat.
However, comparing this to a gym spin class, it is like having the class right in your living room!
And I only did the express version!
I love Cathe so much, I bought the bike because of this dvd!
The chain is a tad loud, but the bike is sturdy and solid.
Great cardio workout.
Gets your heart rate up and makes you a sweaty mess!
It needs to be more upbeat.
I was dying for it to end!
I need to work up to the long ride.

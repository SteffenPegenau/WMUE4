We they were right VERY LOUD.
I think do to it being plastic not a metal base.
Terrible design.
I thought really how bad can a blender be.
I looked in the top of the lid and the stem that triggers the blade to spin when the lid is attached was not there.
OH MY WORD - can you imagine if it would have fallen off in what I was chopping plastic pieces everywhere.
That is why i bought this.
I thought WHAT - why?
Be for warned.
Not sure what other blender is good that also has a food processor.
plastic junk
It was laying in my sink.
It was on sale but still for the price at Kohls over $100 NOT WORTH it.
1st time using the food chopper, which was the first day i bought it, I chopped a few onions - took of the lid to set in sink, put it back on to chop some more and it wouldn't work.
Why is this piece not actually made into the lid - why is it a separate piece which comes unglued and falls out.

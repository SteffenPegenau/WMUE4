As suspected, bogus advice.
Really -- don't do it.
Am still owner of unreliable GPS.
Am still waiting for Magellan/Thales to respond.
Don't do it.
Fresh batteries, no go.
Still have about $400 invested in unit plus software and maps.
Unreliable pile of 'you-know-what'.
Still kicking myself for buying a Magellan product.
Yes, I tried lithium-ion batteries anyway.
Worked fine for about 2 months then refused to power up.
Fresh batteries metered out to 1.62 volts each / 4.84 volts total.
Outsourced call center to India; rep followed generic script telling me to: 1) use lithium-ion batteries, and 2) press "power + NAV" simultaneously.
Still no-go.
Called customer "service".

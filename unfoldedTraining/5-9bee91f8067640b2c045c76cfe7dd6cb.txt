The time is present.
Ares is Percey's cousin.
This book is so good!
Anabeth is a daughter of Athena.
This zapping tale will keep you on the edge of your seat.
Percy is the son of Poseidon.
And Grover is just a satyr.
The setting is Mount Olympus.
The problem is that Zeus's master bolt is stolen.
And they accuse Percy of it.
The main characters are Percy Jackson, Anabeth, and Grover (a satyr.)
I give this electrifying story five stars.
I recommend this book all the way.

I love this book.
On the way to retrieve this magic item, they meet a few Greek foes like Medusa, the minotaur, and the Fates.
It's kind of confusing.
My favorite part is where Percy battles Ares.

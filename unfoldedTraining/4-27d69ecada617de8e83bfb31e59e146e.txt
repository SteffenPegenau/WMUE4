The noise factor of the dryer fan is good.
The ionic works.
We highly recommend this dryer.
We have really noticed a reduction in static charged hair.
The dryer has a 9-ft long thick power cord.
No tangling and plenty of length to be mobile while styling hair.
Received the dryer in a timely manner from manufacturer offered through Amazon.The dryer is holding up well in my home.I have 4 daily users-all with medium to long thick hair.The dryer makes quick of drying hair.
Definitely worth the extra money spent.
It comes with attachment for styling.It is very powerful.
There are 2 fan speeds (High,Low) and 3 temp choices (Hot,Warm,Cool) w/ a cold shot button.
No real issues with accidental on/off switching while drying hair.
I would have like to have seen a third choice (med) on fan speeds.
Especially now that we are in the winter months and home heating is needed.
Cleaning the air filter is a snap.
The dryer stays cool to touch in use.

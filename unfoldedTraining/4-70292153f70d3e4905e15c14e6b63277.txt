P.S.
there are lots of mazes to navigate which are challenging, and the boss battles are pretty tough.
Mega Man is a digger which is someone who goes into caves and looks for crystals and stuff.
buy this game.
Also, there is roll's grampa, Barrel Casket.
they are looking for the mother lode, which is some sorta special; treasure.
Nothing like the originals, but its great.
the old meganman games do not stink they are classics
this is one great game.
Mega Man and Roll are in the game, but they look totally different.
There is lots of room to explore, and if you search you can find parts for roll to use to make you arm weapons like mines.
Note: Megaman is a boy, not a robot.
and you use your megabuster.
Roll gives you advice and stuff.
you can talk to all kinds of people and donate money to the town.

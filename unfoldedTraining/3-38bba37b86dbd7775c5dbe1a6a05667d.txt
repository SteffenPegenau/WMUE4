Apparently "a music fan" is allotted more than one review (if that's what it is) in which to grind some personal axe.
Then make your own mind up.
And we're in our late 30's and early 40's, folks.
It's been ages since I repeated a CD so many times.
I'd like to hear what a full album would sound like.
Hardly.
In any case, the material on this CD is lots of fun and these guys are tight.
On my colleagues it was far more instantaneous.
In any case, read all these reviews and balance them out.
I played it at the office and was swarmed thereafter with queries as to "Who is that?"
So we've heard a lot in our time.
And slow drummer?
"Those guys are great!"
My only wish is for an improved recording of the material (from the technical standpoint rather than the performances - so that's really why it's 3 stars), but that could be my equipment petering out.
While it took a while to grow on me (except track #4 which was instant), it definitely did, and by leaps and bounds.

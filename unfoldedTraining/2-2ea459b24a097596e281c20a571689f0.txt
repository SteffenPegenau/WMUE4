Dave will never find a place in my cd player or in my computer.
(granted, many mainstream bands are horrible, but they all deserve a chance, no?)
That has nothing to do with their quality of sound.
Just oh so mediocre.I don't understand why is he so highly praised?
Music?
Dave, though, he has never impressed me.
But that's on the high side, considering how static it is.
Um.
Hah!
You can be sure your money will be spent on nearly exact replicas of that song.Two stars because it's at least music.
Lyrics?
Nothing special.
Maybe I'm missing something?If you like one of Dave's songs, then by all means, buy this!
I have nothing against bands that are "mainstream".
umm... bland?
Not that he's awful, I suppose it's okay background music...better than nothing.
Voice-wise?
Eh.
it's all the same!

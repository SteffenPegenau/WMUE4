The software mode didnt run slow at all.
If you go to the Myst 3 website, you will see the patches available to you.
I wish it didnt end.
Hope there is a fourth.
The sounds were crisp and realistic and the Villian..Wow, what a nut case.
I had to download 1.2 and play in software mode.
I was glad to be back.
It is well worth it and a perfect addition to my top Adventure PC Games.
And...so glad I was patient enough to download the patch.
Anyone know??
It was beautiful and smooth.
I was really excited to get my hands on MYST 3.
Either 1.1 or 1.2.
Because I played Myst and Riven, working my way around the worlds was almost familiar, but not so to where I could solve the puzzles too easily.
I will miss it...just may play it again.
Its been a long time since I met with Atrus again.
The graphics were outstanding and fun~not only to watch but to actually be a part of.
The only problem is waiting for a patch so I can play the game.

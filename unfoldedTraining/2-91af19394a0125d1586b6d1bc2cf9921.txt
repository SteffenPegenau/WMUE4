I really tried to get into it.
Sorry Hawthorne....
Yawn....
I really, really tried.
It just seems wrong.
Some readers have said to just skip the first chapter or so.
This book contains some seriously long sentences.
I just kept falling asleep.
If you are going to read a book you should try and read it all.
I have read many so called "classics".
I am sorry to say "I have not read the Scarlet Letter."
This book is just plain boring!
I couldn't finish it.
I am an avid reader.
I couldn't do that.

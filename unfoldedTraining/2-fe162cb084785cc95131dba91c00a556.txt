Season 2 was just plaine boring, dumb, and really dissapointing.
How does a show go from being so grood to so bad.
I say don't waste your money on season 2.
standard.
I will give the O.C.
The Cliffhanger wasn't even that good.
The O.C was like my favorite show during it's first season.
become one of the most boring shows on televison in less than half a season.
First of all Season 1 left in a place that had very little story to build off of in the new season.
It is because of this that I will not be watching next year.
some credit, the had lesbians, nice.
It was way to predictable, and had no twists that left you oh my god.
The O.C.
Over all the season sucked.
Season 2, oh boy.
Despite having a great cast the scripts were just not up to the O.C.
How did the O.C.

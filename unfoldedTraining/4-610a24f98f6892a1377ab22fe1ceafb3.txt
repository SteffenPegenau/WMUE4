Clive Davis.
Celine is Whitney now.
I love Celine, but Whitney you know what you gotta do.
Her best one was "My Love Is Your Love".
Her range on some of the songs don't go past a F minor.
Her voice is like no other, and I wish that she would get it together and do it right this time.
And we all know and she even know why?
I love You, Whitney.
"Unashamed" is another good song.
Now, we know she can get up there.I just wanna hear the Whitney Houston that everyone loves.
I am one of the biggest Whitney Houston fans their is, and I have to say that this record of hers is good.
There are 3 songs that are my favorite.
"Tell Me No" is one of the best songs she has ever done.
I love the hell out of that one.
She is letting Celine Dion beat her.
Like she was on a deadline.
I think she needs to go back and do it right.
This CD is too short, like she was in a hurry to finish this.
The rest is not that good.

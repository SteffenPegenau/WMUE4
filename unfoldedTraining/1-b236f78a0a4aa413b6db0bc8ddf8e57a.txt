I am a small framed 5'5, and I ordered a large/medium (the largest size they had)!
Immediately I went to get the dress package to see if I had accidentally ordered a child's.
I feel like I have been lied to.
It said the model was 5'6.
In the picture it came to the models feet.
It also said on the package a hat was included.
NEVER!
This company has a bad mark with me.
I will NEVER use this dishonest company again.
I had ordered the correct size, it was just a fraud.
I tried contacting them so I could return this item 2 days ago.
I was very upset.
The dress came to my knees!!
Big surprise!
When I received this costume I pulled out the dress and tried it on.
I haven't heard anything back from them.
I did not receive a hat in the package.

OK, it is LIVE.
There are some moments where Groban is very good but not many.
It's painful to hear and worse when you know that Groban is so much better.
We're the paying fans.
And singers can have a bad day.
Since this is not a charity gig either, I can place the blame on the artist and producer.I'm not defending him either.The guy is a multi-millionaire and I'm not.
We DO deserve better.
This concert set is quite poor.
But I am paying for this concert set and it's my review so here goes.Groban's voice is...yes....noticably nasal.
However, he does take credit as producer, et al.
So certainly I can have my say and will do so here.Bottom line.
So perhaps it would be fair to say that we can lay some of the blame at his very feet.
Yes.
Sure.
The least of all problems that beset Josh Groban is the fact that his singing is below par.

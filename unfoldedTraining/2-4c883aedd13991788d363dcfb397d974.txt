If you are both of these, then maybe.
I think I laughed about three times.
You'll laugh more actually watching most Mormon Cinema.
And thank goodness it wasn't feature length (only 70 minutes).
Okay, this wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen.
I would say (in fact yell) no.
Not really.Worth the time to watch?
But I wish I never rented this.
But they were trying so (too?)
I laughed enough to award it an extra star.
hard to be funny... it just didn't catch.Different?
But I sat there looking at my watch counting down the moments until the ending credits.Funny?
Oh, yeah!!!Interesting?
Well, I actually used to make movies in high school and I'm LDS (a mormon) so this should have been right up my alley.
It is rather pointless and a waste of 70 minutes of my life.Recommended?
If you are neither or one of these two then I would say no.

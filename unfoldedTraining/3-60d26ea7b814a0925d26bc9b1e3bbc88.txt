The island changed his life by teaching him there is more to life than just fighting.
The conflict in the story was his anger.
But anyway out of 5 stars I give it a 3.
It rained a lot there.
He first showed his anger by beating the crap out of Peter, so he got sent to an island in Alaska.
But anyway he got rescued and he had to go back to the island to fix what he messed up.
It just didn't grab my attention well enough.
He also ran into the legendary White spirit bear.
He got mad at it because it wasn't scared of him, so he tried to kill it, but it almost killed him instead.
The book touching spirit bear is an all right book.
It was a huge island with a big lake.
It was ok because I just wasn't able to focus on it.
It was weird because it didn't attack him it just stared at him.
When he got there Peter was there because he tried to commit suicide twice.
Then for a couple of days the bear came back, and just looked at him.
He solved his anger problem by getting sent to the island.

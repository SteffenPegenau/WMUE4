We can almost recite the whole film!
It's not gorey or anything, my 8 year old brother watches it with us and we all get a BIG kick out of it.
Its hard to explain so I guess I won't anymore.
If you are looking for some good laughs, see The Paperboy!
It is our most favorite movie of all time!
I'm not saying its a bad movie because it is funny and not scary, I'm saying its an even BETTER movie.
She is also good in this movie.
He is actually a good actor.
My sisters and I rent it ALL THE TIME and watch it.
But not in a bad way.
Just please see tthe Paperboy!
It is not really comicly funny, its just intended to be scary, but it turns out funny.
Please see this movie.
And of course everyone knows Alexandra Paul, she was on Baywatch.
Ok, I know this is supposed to be a scary flick, but oh my gosh it isn't!
He is VERY dramatic.
Marc Marut is the PERFECT paperboy.
I am urging you to!

And what is that stupid ending anyway?
And does the Tom Cruise character have a mind?
This flick was made in Jonathan Swift's Laputa, land in the sky.
The sexuality in it is not sexy, it is wierd.
The ending is utterly unsatisfactory.
I'm not a Stanley Kubrick fan.
They built us a complicated structure, and I'm standing on the sidelines pointing out that the emperor has no clothes on, and his underwear is funny looking.
The actors talk too slow.
Hey - let's get down to earth a little.
Or is he a suit of clothes with a balloon inside, being led around by the nose by every other character in the movie?
Would it be too much to ask to have Nicole Kidman's character have her head screwed on straight instead of being whatever the hell she is here?
It's all part of the pseudo wierdness that is going on in this inferior movie.
A little reality please, in the characters, their reactions, something?
Eyes closed.
This is a wierd movie.
I think he is pretty bad.

Wait, where did it go?
Well I can get that!
And that!
What, is that it over there?
And that!
And I have used it to the delight of a miniature poodle, a dachshund, and an English setter.
No, the pet doesn't chew on it.
You catch their attention by flashing the beam across the room and Oh, what's that?
I'm going to get it!
I bought this on the advice of a neighbor, and it's a super pet toy!
I know of one cat who loves playing with the beam so much that she comes loving every time she hears the click of the beam (her owner has a different style).This pointer can point really far, which is a plus.
... You can use it indoors in a not too bright room, or with the lights or, or outdoors at night; it's all equally fun.
There!
A couple of the tips aren't useful (i.e., the $ sign), but choose any of the large symbols and you are set to go for a fun, interactive time with your pet!
Cats love it even more.

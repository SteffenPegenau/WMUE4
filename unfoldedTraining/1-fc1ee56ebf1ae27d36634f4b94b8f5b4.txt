AND Italics!
The kids have sex!
Miraculous escapes galore occur.
With guns!
(Damn those exclamation points!)
Fast!
Patterson's breathless prose runs toward 6th grade level and use of exclamation points!
Duh.Pass on this featherweight (Sorry!
Will they catch the bad guys!
It gets old!
The kids are being chased by bad men.
The vet and the Fibbie have sex!
And listen to Macy Gray!

James Patterson lays an egg (couldn't resist).
When we will learn.This book is a pointless "thriller" loaded with tin-ear dialogue and enough stale pop-culture references to make you think he's taking product placement fees.
By the end of the third chapter - which in a Patterson book is page 5 - I knew this book was a loser.
I slogged through it though, because I had 2 hours to kill.For anyone who still might be interested, here's a plot summary: six kids are genetically engineered to have wings.
They are helped by a selfless vet and a renegade FBI agent who want to be their parents.

Oh, well, your loss, not mine.Cecy
One w/George Raft is Good.
But this Bad Blonde had some Italian speaking fat gent who was blonde's husband, who looked like a fat frog w/mouth open.
Will NOT let me do each separately.
Sorry, but Bad Blonde not very adult.
This Italian gent you could not discern what he was saying even when English (assumed) was spoken by him.
Others not terribly entertaining, but passable.
Enjoyed in spite of all.
I don't underSTAND this.
Blackout Good, Man Bait w/G.Brent ok, Stolen Face terrific.
My, my!ALSO, although another disc/pkgs ordered, it is including ALL the 4 discs under this one heading.
I tend to think of Film Noir as being George Raft, Cagney, or Bogart, and occasionally Robert Mitchum.
Dane Clark almost always good, tho.
And I do NOT appreciate foreign language in a film without an English CAPTION of what is being said.
Guess English/British actors different?

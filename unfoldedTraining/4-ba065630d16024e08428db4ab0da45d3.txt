Sometimes, people ask me to low the volume down b/c it is too loud.Batteries are kind of cheap.
They work like a charm.
We are using unlimited SkyOut in US.
Save us a ton of money for the phone.
But I don't need land line anymore anyway.As the others review, it doesn't seem to sync the contact list (It did on my first phone).
But I can get the good batteries at any store for cheap.
Don't try with land line.
You can add contact on the phone without turn your PC on too.
People are surprised when we don't use regular phone any more.
Great job.
Nice phone, great sound.
I recommend to change default password on the box as well.
Having 5 of them for 3 months now.
Updated new firmware as soon as I got them.
But we don't need anyway.
Don't try SkyIn yet.

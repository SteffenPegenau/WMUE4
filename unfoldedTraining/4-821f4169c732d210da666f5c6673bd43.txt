If you haven't tried that you should, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
My first one did not have a fan, did not have anything digital and didn't come with such a comprehensive recipe book.
After attempting to make a lot of different things in it I can see why people go with the excalabur in the end.
I'm going to end up switching to an excalabur, but this is a really good product.
square all around.
It says that you don't have to rotate the trays, but in actuality if you don't the top one does dry faster.
Ever try making crackers?
I want to be able to make crackers that are cracker shaped.
I've tried only 2 different types of dehydrator so far and this one has been the best so far.
it"s more difficult to make squares in a circular device.
Nit picky am I?
It does dry fast enough to make dried Canteloupe which is awesome!
Maybe, but it's the small things and this is not a cheap kitchen appliance.
IE.
I want a fruit rollup that I can cut into neat strips and actually roll up.

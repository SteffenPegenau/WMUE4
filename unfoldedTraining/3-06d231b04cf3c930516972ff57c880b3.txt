At least it tries to be different.
The only thing more amusing than a cheap domestic horror flick is an imported variety.
(This reviewer is a master of this type of foolishness).
Others beware.
On the plus side, we can award points for effective atmosphere.
The unwary viewer must accept Klaus Kinski (of all people) as Edgar Allan Poe.
The entertainment is strictly for die-hard fans of schlock horror flicks.
;-)
You get the idea.
The film is weird rather than scary.
Ghosts abound, but they don't jump out and say, "Boo!"
The picture begins to resemble a gothic romance, in places.
Then we have clean-shaven Tony Franciosa, wearing togs from the 1970s, as the 1840s guy who accepts the inevitable challenge to spend the night in the haunted castle.
In that context, it is worth collecting.
The film might be considered as camp entertainment, but we aren't sure that the Italian filmmaker had purposeful satire in mind.
The haunting wraiths have other things in mind.

This is a good starting anthology of JGW.
!
I ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOLL!
I smile when I hear his voice, his licks, his "Listen"'s between verses.
Every time.
I LOVE this man, miss him.
My only regret is that "The Real Deal" is inexplicably missing from it.
That is a scat MASTERPIECE.
YOU ARE THE FREAKIN' MAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Another thing the above viewer pointed out, is JGW's use of humor in his compositions.
I mean, I just CRY when I hear Johnny vamp at the end of "Real Mother For Ya": "Gimme some of that low lead, I ain't gonna fool with nuthin' else!
I discovered him too late to see him in concert, and that is my greatest regret of all.
I play him almost every day.
Johnny "Guitar"?
I gotta STOP buying TWO hot dogs and a strawberry soda!"
This man IS a giant...right up there...with ANYONE you'd care to name.

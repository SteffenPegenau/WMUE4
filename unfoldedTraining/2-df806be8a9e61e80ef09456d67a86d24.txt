I WANTED RAW MEAT BEATLES!
Hello.....there were only 4 Beatles as far as history goes!
Who got what idea first?
How did all that music start?
I had no desire to "get to know Stu" or his German girlfriend.
Creative license run amuck!
And where the heck is Ringo in all of this?
WHAT FIFTH BEATLE!
Instead this film serves up a large empty plate that left me hungry for the real deal!
A mere mention of him!
But to go so far as to spend over 2 hours exploring a guy who wasn't even a Beatle at all.
I would have much rather had seen what made McCartney and Lennon so prolific together.
Where was the genius in all of this?
This is supposed to be a film about the greatest rock band of the 20th century and we're wasting film on a guy who never even did anything of any value with the group!
In this film Paul comes off like a choir boy younger brother to the controlling Lennon.
Who cares about the "fifth" Beatle!

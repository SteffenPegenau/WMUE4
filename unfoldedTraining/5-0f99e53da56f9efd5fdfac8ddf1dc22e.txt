I love to listen to his music.

I thought that was God's job.
Many people are against him nowadays because of the things that were said to be done by him but not yet proven.
His music is still hot.
But even if they are proven, who are "you all" to judge someone.
R Kelly's music has been hot from his beggining.
Let us all remember that we all make mistakes and none of us are perfect.
Thats my opinion.
I've never listened to an R Kelly song that i've disliked.
I finally decided to give my own.
He, in my opinion, is the most talented R&B vocal artist ever, and I'm sure that many would agree.
If R Kelly has made a mistake, don't put his music down because of it, because his music has nothing to do with it.
R Kelly is in one word, "Talented."
I've heard enough of the critics opinions.

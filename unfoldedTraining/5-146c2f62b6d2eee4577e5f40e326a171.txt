The plot is great, and as said before, very well written.
The music added so much to the movie, and would not be as great as it is, without it.
David Bowie couldn't have done any better.
My hats of the Jim Henson.
His music was phenominal, for lack of a better word, not to mention his acting.
Jennifer Connelly did a spectacular job on her character!
The music, was outstanding and should have won millions of gramys and awards.
The art was amazing.
Bully for David Bowie and Terry Jones.
Labyrinth is a well performed movie, and well written.
It is the best movie of all time.
As the movie went on, it captavated any one lucky enough to view it.
I can not stress the effectivness of the music.
I would strongly recomend anyone going out and seeing it.
The entire cast did a spectacular job.

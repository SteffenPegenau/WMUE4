Yes.
No.
This is a useful addition to a bookshelf as well as a quick read over the complex history of Ireland.
Be advised that there is weighting toward the nineteenth and twentieth century.
I think that's the key, information is presented in the style and detail of the professional historian but without all the scholarly apparatus.
Furthermore, the prose is readable and not bogged down with a mass of professional notes.
For that and diaspora study The Great Shame is a better bet.
Would I buy this book again?
The scholar ,seeking proper reference or in depth character and motivation, must look elsewhere.
Why?
Best advice I can give: decide why you might want it.
Does it captivate me as some histories do?
it is a valuable reference tool.
If you want to quickly place the "Wild Geese" or Wolf Tone or Cromwell in a historical context it will prove an invaluable tool.
There is some discussion of the famine and emigration, but only as part of the historical progression.

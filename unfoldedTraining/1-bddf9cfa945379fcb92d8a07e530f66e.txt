No, it failed to work at any point in a 1200 mile journey.
I returned it - five *'s for Amazon for the great return policy!
This was an embarassing dud.
It was down... for 3 days during Christmas.
Second, it has so many utilities to let you know how many satellites it sync'd with, their individual signal strengths, their constellation.
First, it worked.
That failed.
I asked the recipient of my gift to go ahead and take their trip and see if it was just a location issue.
It gets 5 *'s.
Not sure whether they have a help desk, but their web site was up whenever I needed it.
It failed to lock to any satellite.
Maybe (all of) the employee(s) left for the holiday season.I tried suggestions provided by Amazon users.
I then went to the web site for Nexian.
The manual did not provide help.
:).I bought Magellan.
I bought this as a Christmas gift.
Hope it helps.

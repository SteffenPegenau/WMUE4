You have to unlock the cars and motorcycles by winning races in career mode.
This game is fun because you can also jump from high places and land hard.
The NOS waists though.
Every time you unlock a new car, that car has a certain skill that the rest of the cars don't.
There are different game modes to choose from, like Career Mode, Online Play, and Capture The Flag.
The graphics are real good.
I would recommend this game to anyone.
Go to the store and buy Midnight Club II now.
I didn't like Midnight Club 1 too much.
I went to the store and brought it.
There are 3 places in the game: L.A., Paris, and Tokyo.
You can also change the colors of the cars.
It's way better than the first one.
I loved it.
You can also boost up a little by using the NOS.
The cars are the tightest thing in the game.
Then my friend told me that Midnight Club II was better.
For example, the Jersey XS, which I unlocked by beating the champ of L.A., has 2-Wheel Driving.

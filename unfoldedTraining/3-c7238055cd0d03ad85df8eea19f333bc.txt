Please never say never again !
I like his CD.
(And please more "Gun-Barrel"music for fan!)
But I really wish to buy Vol.3 !
5) Most of all, why no "Gun-Barrel"music ?
(I wish to hear "Gun-Barrel"music of "Live and let die" and Sound Track CD of "License to kill" has bad editing!)
Film version of "Tank Drive Around ST. Petersburg"is welcome, though it isn't so nice cue for me.
2) "Bond 77"(or "Car Chase" music) isn't here.
more.
(I love that cue!)
)So , I gave only 3 stars to this CD.
3) "Hercules Takes Off"is too Fast.
4) More musics of "Golden eye" should be here.
(Especially "Climax Chase on Antenna"must be!)
Because, 1) No "Live and let die"and "License to kill" music is here.
My best cue on this CD is "Freefall"(Yes, Pre-title action cue of "Moonraker"!
But I love 1st vol.

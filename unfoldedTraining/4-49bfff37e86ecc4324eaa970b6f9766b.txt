I loved the fun they had together.
Taylor's was cute and funny, sweet and without anger.
The film was based on this tiny restaurant.
They partied and danced, laughed and played tricks on each other and the guys they were involved with.
I looked it up and they really have good pizza.
It has expanded and there are now two.
It sounds absolutely wonderful.
It can be ordered frozen through air mail and some stores actually sell it in the eastern states.
My favorite would be the Seafood Delight, with clams and scallops.
This is definately a girl movie because it is all about the lives of 3 girls around 20 or so.
Robert's character had alot of bravado and spirit.
I would like to go to Mystic, it seems like such a neat place to visit.Lisa Nary
I loved the town of Mystic, Ct. You know there really is a Mystic Pizza.
She held back more when the other 2 partied or got crazy.
They even vouch to have the mysterious sauce.
Gish's was sensitive and smart.

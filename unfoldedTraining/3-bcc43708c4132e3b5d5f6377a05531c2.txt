Because the game makes you wait for a real long time to reach the objective.
Don't buy unless tyou've got some time to urn on something that's not even worth the time spending looking for it Online, much less the money you're paying on it.
Roller Coaster Tycoon is sort of reminiscent of the Sims.
But I can't understand how anyone can beat this game.
because after a month of playing, it gets about as boring as possible.
Why?
My advice?
Great.
A wasted five hours?
Now what?
I bought the second expansion big deal, a few more Rollercoasters and themes and new levels.
By the third month I have already reached the objective and need to go do other things for three hours while the days pass onscreen.
It's impossible unless you suddenly live in a Starbucks and have a month off to do whatever you want.
I beat about five of the levels but it took forever.
Why?
and then, a the end of the second year my computer goes to sleep and I can't get it back up again.

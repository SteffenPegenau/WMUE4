I mean think about when she lost her first race.
What happened to Glory, Pride, Glory's Joy, etc.?
What she needs to do is just shut up about Champion always winning.
If you ask me Cindy is not a good sport.
Did they mysteriously dissappear?
All she thinks about is winning.
Geeze!!!
Then she goes from champion racer to champion racer.
But it was too predictable.
What happened to the little orphan girl that never won anything in her life?
She only told her the truth.
When she spun on her heal and left as the winning jockey was about to give her a tip.
He is not even undefeated.
And then Cindy gets all upset becuse Ashleigh told her Champion wasn't Cindy's.
Cindy is such a brat.
How can Max even stand her?
Yet a good plot and all.
Umm can we say spoiled?

This system is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!
These are so hard to find so go on Ebay.
The DS games are like half the size of Game Boy Advance games.
It was hard to get but I'm glad I did.
They have tons and thats where I got mine.
I have only 1 thing that I didn't like about it.
!
First, let me assure you that I myself do own this system.
The touch screen is awsome and I chat with my brother all the time with PictoChat.
I really like Mario 64 DS and The Urbz.
The Metroid Prime demo is almost a game and you can play against someone else in multiplayer.
The only Game Boy games that you can play are Game Boy Advance games.
Get this system today!!
Everything else about this system is great.
You can chat with up to 15 other people within 100 feet using PictoChat!
Although most people will be playing mostly with DS games and using other built-in features, it would still be nice to be able to play Game Boy games.

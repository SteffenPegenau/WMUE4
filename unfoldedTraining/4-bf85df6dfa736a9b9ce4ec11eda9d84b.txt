As far as I know there will only be one writer for the books, Joanna Cambell.
The books will be good, but not great.
They used to captivate the reader now there just same thing.
And I'm think Karen Bently did too.
The new righters are good but they don't fill the empty space.
Joanna kept the reader's interest.
As for Wonder's Star everyone must have known that he would win the Belmont Stakes.You at book #24 shifted it from racing to jumping.
We didn't want that.
You need to get the spark back in.
Even though you put racing back those books were a wast of time.
I don't like it.
you know what's going to happen before it does.
I still like to read them but something isn't right.
With Image, there in real life, would be no possible way for her to win the Kentucky Derby.
I'm not sure what happened to the books.

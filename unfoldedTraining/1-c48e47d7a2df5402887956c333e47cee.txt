I don't allow the children to use it because I was afraid they would mess it up.
I purchased this in September 2011 and this is only Feburary 2012.
So I would not waste my money on this product.
The shapener is not working already.
I purchased it for my classroom.
If anyone knows of a good heavy duty sharpener, please let me know.
We handle it with care.
This sharpener is garbage.
However, on a better note, Amazon did deliver this product quick.
No reflection on amazon, but the product is just garbage.
I can't afford to keep wasting money especially living on a teachers salary.
Myself and another teacher sharpens the pencils every morning for our class.
This was just too soon providing only adults have been using it.
This is my 4th sharpener I have purchased.
Don't buy this sharpener.

I wired my network then returned this little headache.
That call turned out to be the longest 2 hours of my life.
Dropped connection, poor signal, freezes the USB port.
I disconnected the adaptor for the last time and did a system restore.
Nothing seemed to help.
I read several forums and followed the suggestions.
I researched a couple of wireless devices prior to purchasing the Linksys router and adapter.
I figured, "Both from the same company.
Problem solved.
This should be no problem."
This adapter is terrible.
Don't ask me how, but it did.
By the way, all the paperwork recommends this device for Windows Vista.
I called Linksys tech support.
I downloaded the most recent drivers for the adapter and for my USB.
The last straw was when the adapter lost my control panel.

I rest my case.
Wait, wait wait.
We'll just send another arnold back to the past to save the little defenseless dude again.
I'll get my wish.
And I know bad movies.
Just like the last one and the last one before that.
Alright, If you want a good action movie, watch THE ONE!
And didn't that terminator dude "I'll be back."
It's just a simple repeat, like MIB2.
In the next one he will die.
It's all good.
Honestly now!
When you say the end of the world, did you mean a large portion of it?
Let's get real here.
Because believe it or not, there is still more people fighting the machines.
Alright.
Die you terminator.
OH YEAH!I know good movies.
WHEN WILL IT END!?
Alright, that's nice.

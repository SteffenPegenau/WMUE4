They work well as dusters and general maintenance tools.
Other than that , I would recommend this thing.
It's like having a new pet.
They work best on tile, vinyl or wood flooring.
Picks up hair and smaller objects but not so good with the big stuff.
If you have a dirty house to begin with, these roombas will not clean it for you.
Does really well in the kitchen or bathrooms.
Keep in mind that it will not replace your current vacuum.

The best feature is it's ability to park and recharge itself.
Not so good on carpets.
I find my self talking to it sometimes, strange?
These Roombas work great!
That's really cool.
I gave one to my girl friend and she loves it.

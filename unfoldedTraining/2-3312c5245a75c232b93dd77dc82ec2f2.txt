Everyone's tastes are different, and I realize others enjoy this "recital" quite a bit.
It's almost as if they sat down with the intent to prove how good they are and that they can do whatever they want with the banjo.
I love Fleck and Trischa.
I had hoped for background guitar, bass, fiddle, with the banjo being featured.
The things these two fellows can do on their banjos is very impressive.
Nothing I can learn from nor sing along with.
I doubt I will listen to this again.
But that is not at all what this is.
Several of Fleck's tracks sounded almost like practice exercises.... Lots of runs with fancy finger work and no particular melody.
But I wish I'd spent my money on one of Tony's other CD's.
So it seems like they just started improvising.
But this CD disappointed me.
But the "songs" here are very abstract.....
No accompaniment with other instruments, so it really isn't recognizable bluegrass at all.
When it says "Solo Banjo", that is precisely correct.

Hard to believe they were "acting" since I was convinced they were really in love.
Not sure why the film needed to be set as a documentary versus just letting it play out as a standard movie.
Worth the money to buy this DVD and keep it in your library of great Lesbian films.
This has to be the longest kiss ever in a film.
Not sure why they needed to move forward 6 months and then try to tie up the lose ends.
Loved this film.
Thought the acting was outstanding by the leading ladies.
The ending was a different.
The husband "Barry" was perfect for the role of the preacher with a problem understanding that its actually possible for people to love someone of the same sex.
The film held my attention.
Tended to distract from the movie in my opinion.
I guess having the ladies walk off into the sunset would be too mundane.
The son Nash wasn't as convincing playing the role of the son that discovers his mother's little secret.
Especially during the scenes involving the two lead characters.
Bravo!

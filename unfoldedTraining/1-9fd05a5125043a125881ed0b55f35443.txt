It's all the time and it's rediculous.
Trust me, I can wait for something to load, I'm not just annoyed becuase it's an occasional thing.
Always had, ever since the first sims came out on PC.
No house building, etc.Secondly, the loading times are the worst I've ever seen on any system ever.
The game could have been mediocre, but the implimentation was horrible.
I love the sims.
Even going up to talk to a person makes it hang for a good 2-3 seconds.
The disc is constantly thrashing in the PSP, and it seems like nothing pre-loads.
It shouldn't have even been allowed to be on the psp.
Ebay, here I come!
It goes on and on.
Boy, was I wrong.
Then you go into a house, another 2-3 seconds.
Like someone else said, it's basically a 1st person rpg.
Naturally, I was excited to get this version, and take the sims with me anywhere!
This is nothing like the old sims we all know and love.First off, I never ran into anything 'simmy' about it.
Then, you open a door, 2-3 second hang.

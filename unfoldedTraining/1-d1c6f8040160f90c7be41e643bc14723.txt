We reset and restarted.
Gave us our money back no questions.
It started up, and then the compressor kicked in after 3 minutes.
Brought it home and put it in the window.
We bought one at Lowe's and said, "Wow what a Deal".
At the return counter there is 7 other Frigidaire Air Conditioners, all brought in on the same day according to the lady at the counter.
Nothing.
Now the compressor does not start.
Brought it back to Lowes.
So far so good.
Went to PC Richards, and bought a Friedrich for a bit more, but cools very nicely.
We try it in another 20 Amp circuit.
Tried everything stated on forums and in manual.
She rolled her eyes and as if to say, "Oh no another Frigidaire".
This unit and most of Frigidaire's Air Conditioners are junk.
Seems like it was the compressor that shorted out.
Same thing, my little Lasko fan was better than this.
Then the 20 Amp circuit it is on blows.

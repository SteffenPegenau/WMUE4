There is something a little too "well behaved" in Mamet's doctrine.
When something works it is self evident.
Yes, the story is important, but so is how you tell it.
Mamet's book is the best.
But it's a lot of FUN to break those rules.
Actors should be more on the criminal side than the side of the status quo.
We should be human, not ACTORS.
There is something to be said for crash and burn acting.
What is missing is something about "mucking around" and seeing what you can get away with.
Mamet says he may have been a criminal if not an artist.
I saw an interview with Mamet where he admitted that there are times in rehearsal that all of his ideas about acting don't help.
Mamet's book is excellent, and on the whole true, but often there is often something missing, and I realise this is sacrilege, and that thing missing is flavour.
I feel that is what has been lost.
Also, as Mamet himself would say, beware of doctrine.
Basically his ideas are the jumping off point.

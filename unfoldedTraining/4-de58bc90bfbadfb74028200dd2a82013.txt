"Clay lies still, but blood's a rover; Breath's a ware that will not keep.
I felt I could understand what Billy Chapel was feeling and why he did the things he did.
There'll be time to sleep."
It' about life.
Never give up till the job's done.
Introdution.
I think everyone should read this book.
But when you finnaly get in to it, it's one of the best books ever.
Up, lad: when the journey's over.
This book is not just about baseball.
When I first read this when I began the book, I didn't understand it.
But when I finished the book it made perfect sense.
It tells a story about a man's struggle with love and life.
It fit Billy Chapel's persona perfect.
What I thought was so awesome about this book was it made a personnal connection to me.
The only prombelm with the book is that it is a liitle bit hard to understand at first.

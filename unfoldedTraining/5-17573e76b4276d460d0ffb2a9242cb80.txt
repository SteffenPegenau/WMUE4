Unlike Black, White has an unexpected ending.
I suppose what's going on in the other reality could be classified as a disaster story.
It's like reading two stories.
It's very appealing the way the author connects these two worlds.RED is pretty much a war story.
This is a great book.
He's got a knack for showing, not telling.
I found the ending of Red to be very emotional.
Both interesting.
Ted Dekker appears to be a master at presenting "tears of joy."
Afterall, the world is on the brink of ending through biological terror.
White was just as good as Black.
I liked black a lot.
His method makes the reader feel the scene.I'm eager to get started with his novel "Infidel."
Then, Red was even better.
I think the best one is that the main character keeps going back and forth between two realities.
Then again, that's the one world.
The climax is thought provoking.There are many reasons why I like this story.
Talk to you about it later.

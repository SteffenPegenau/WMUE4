They don't need 30people on stage with them to take the heat off.
Banks is cool but this Tony Yayo person is wack.
Will somebody please call Kane , Kool G Rap , KRS-ONE , Rakim , or Cool J.
Who cares about your ice , yours cars , your women , or your big homes.
The content of this music is weak.
His g-unit partner 50 cent is a disgrace on the mic.
These cats are not creative.
These g-unit people are horrible.
I hope Tony and 50 take their rymesto the rap rehab!
Never!
These are true mc's who can flow and have a phat stage show.
He just mumbles words over beats.
Tryin to be like Parrish Smith from EPMD.
It is a shame kids have to listen to such crap rap.
The 80's rapperswould eat Tony Yayo's lunch!

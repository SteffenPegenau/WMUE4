What the hell!
Mainly because EVERY single year EA sports will change the controls to TRY and make something different.
The controls were confusing and everything i liked about audibling, shifting lineman, shifting wide receivers changed to a completely different button.
KEEP THE CONTROLS THE SAME FOR GOD SAKES!
Also hated it.
BETTER COMMENTATING!
MAKE THE GAME PLAY MORE REALISTIC WITH BETTER NON GEEKY SPRINTING STYLES, MAKE BETTER CHAMPIONSHIP CELEBRATIONS!!!
GOOD GOD!
I then purchased ncaa 07.....hated it.
Also I learned I had to press 2-3 different buttons to scroll through the menu while on the roster!!!!!
PEOPLE WANT THE SAME CONTROL OPTIONS PEOPLE!
I completely stopped playing it after the 07 version on xbox 360.
For one, this game used to be my favorite game on regular xbox UNTIL I went out and bought a xbox 360.
STOP CHANGING THEM.
Then played ncaa football 08.

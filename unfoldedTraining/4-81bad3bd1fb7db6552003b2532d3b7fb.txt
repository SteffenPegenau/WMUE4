Now they're adults.
Give the writers, cast and crew a break.
BRAVO.
I wasn't a big fan of the final espisode but considering that SMG wanted to pursue other projects, the network change, the adult figures in Buffy's life weren't around anymore, the Scooby Gang are now adults and they're still fighting demons on top of that?!
Dark?
Okay, they're adults living on the hellmouth but still...
BRAVA.
Okay, earlier seasons were more fun, but that's life.
It was a good end to a great series.
Sad?
All shows get stale with time but "Buffy" was still entertaining.
Yes.
The characters were younger and just figuring life out.
Yes.
I still miss this show.
Stil wickedly funny?

This CD is simply wonderful.
As an artist myself, I tend to believe that my BEST work is yet to come.
When I say he's an artist to watch, and he will only get better as he ages, I mean it.
Happily Everafter In Your Eyes (Couldn't leave you to go to heaven)...is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard in a long time.
You continue to inspire me.
And, yes, he's a poet at heart.
His music touches the soul.
But every song here is noteworthy.
Keep doing your thing, Ben Harper.
He IS brilliant, though.
I was delighted to see that Amazon.com named Both Sides of the Gun one of the top CDs of 2006.
Brilliant in the sense that no matter what kind of music he turns his attention to, he gives his very best.
And that voice...heavenly.
That's not hyperbole.
His lyrics are beautiful.
I'm not going to write that Ben Harper is the most talented musician today: I'm sure he doesn't want to hear that.

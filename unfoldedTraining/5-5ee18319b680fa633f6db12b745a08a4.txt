Aquila is a quick squirt then you wipe with a paper towel or soft cloth.
I've tried other leather cleaners and soaps.
His oil has accumulated on the couch.
You actually see the dirt on the cloth.

I think I want to buy their conditioner to keep the leather soft.
This product was a good solution.
They would remove some of the darkened area, but only with a lot of work.
You do have to act quickly.
So, I spray, wipe, then spray, wipe again.
After the area is dry, there is a definite difference and the oil spot is far less noticeable.
The couch is not smooth leather, it has a texture, but not really suede either.
Wish my dog liked dog beds.
My golden retriever likes to use one end of the sectional as his personal space.
If the area isn't wet, the oil doesn't come off.
I purchased Aquila Leather and Suede cleaner for my couch.

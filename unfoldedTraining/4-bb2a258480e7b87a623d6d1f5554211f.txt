Dropped out of ARRT Registry in 1982.
With 1,400 questions, all on CD, you can go over & over the material until you feel comfortable in all areas.
The 4th edition w/CD-Rom was the backbone of my efforts.
Saia.
There are some errors in question answers, however they are minor.
I am currently employed as a Registered Radiologic Technologist.
Thankyou D. A. Saia!
I used only the the two books indicated and a current Medical Dictionary.
I graduated X-Ray Tech school in 1960.
I had been out of the field for 30 years.
It is thourough and comprehensive.
I used it in conjunction with "Prep" Program Review & Exam Preperation, also by D.A.
After taking the ARRT exam I knew I bought the right books.
This book is the Greatest.
Prep gave me a refresher review.
I felt comfortable with the Computer foremat and although some questions on the exam were unfamiliar, I felt well prepared for the exam.
I passed my exam with a 89.
You helped to make it happen for me.

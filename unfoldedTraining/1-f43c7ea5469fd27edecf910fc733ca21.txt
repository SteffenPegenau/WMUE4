Are these new "romance" historical/regencey, etc.
written for women?
No way, not for me.
Beth, what a story it could have been.
So sad.
If you're into the porn genre, then this book is for you.
My God, where are these authors going.
Just took away from the story, terribly.
Where is the touch, the look, the word's, the tenderness, all that would make a women feel?
I would have actually loved this book.
This is porn.
Historical and all.
I think there were pages and pages I skipped through of pure porn.
Just such a shame.
I just couldn't get past the non-romance, non-feeling, do depth of relationship, yuk, that is love?

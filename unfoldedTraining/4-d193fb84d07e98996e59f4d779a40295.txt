They are stiff at first, almost like wearing a new burlap bag.
The crotch definitely isn't going to split anytime soon.
They are constructed like Fort Knox.
The fit and color were accurate and true to amazon's descriptions.
I can see these lasting for years.
I spend a nervous day in downtown New York City constantly feeling my pockets to make sure my wallet and phone hadn't slipped out.
Other than that, I love them.
My biggest complaint is lack of security in the pockets.
None of the pockets have any buttons or even velcro.
They also come with a slight boot cut which makes them fit perfectly until it gets to the knee, they it looks baggy.
These pants come so close to being perfect!
A few washes later and they're getting much better.
Aren't these suppose to be for rugged carpenters and outdoorsmens?
If you leave them in the dryer they will dry pretty wrinkled and in the wrinkle's creases it leaves faint white marks.
I have no idea what these are, but they are unsightly.

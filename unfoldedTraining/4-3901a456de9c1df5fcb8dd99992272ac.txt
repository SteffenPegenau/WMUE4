There's water damage and clothes left there.
I live in a basement.
Its worth the money.
The reviews on it were not even close to this one.I decided to go back give it a try.
So it was real hard to breath.
I also didn't know if the air had mildew, or other living organisms.I woke up with bad headaches or a stopped up nose.
Some times I would just be sick with cold type symtoms.The reviews on this item were 21 out of 22 (good) on one site and the same kind of thing on others.
I can breath.
I trust the air I breath.
I used chatt window customer service with a site that sells air filters.
I'm not stopped up or sick every day.
I got the same results as they did.
It does the job of cleaning the air so you can breath.
This is a good air filter.
They recommended a $500-600 filter.

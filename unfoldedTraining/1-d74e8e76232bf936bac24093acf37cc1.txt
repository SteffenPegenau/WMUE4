Now one of unit develop the suction issue.
No biggie.
I finally realized after took it apart that there is a filter inside of canister that is completely clogged up.
I will need to replace the filter for each unit.
So we have actually two of these Hoover Elite Rewind Bagless vaccums at our house(one for each floor).
You save money on bags but this one will get you on the filters (around $5 each) and probably last you 6 months of less.
My wife ordered the second one based on the first one.
It simply won't pick up any thing anymore.
Folks.
The unit works very well at begining.
I have no pet but 3 kids.
Both units broke belt once within 6 months of use.
I took out 5 screws at bottom of each unit and replace belt for each unit.
I don't think it is washable.
I suggest look else where for a good vaccum.
I have hardwood floors/tiles at my house.

I grew up in Ash Valley...I know these people.
I would have given this book a good review.
That is until I got to the part where "Lusty Lloyd" writes a story about someone I love.
It was unkind, ignorant, and just plain false.
But I know it's not.
Had it been true, I'd let it go.
The stories were interesting and raw...just like I like them.
In fact, a great deal of these stories are embellishments.
I was very disappointed.
The title states that these are "His True Life Stories."
207 true stories?
But if you don't care about that, then you'll probably love this book.
I bought this book as a Christmas present, but could not give it to anyone because it would have hurt them.
I think not.
Had the names of these people been used, he could have been very easily sued for slander.

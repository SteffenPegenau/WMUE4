Zero stars for stupid melodic guitars, boring bass, boring drums, boring, pointless, stupid, screeching lyrics, boring everything.
I originally thought this would be a metal album but it isn't.
Their lyrics are as shallow, as jumbled, and as repetive as this review.
I'm angry that I wasted my money on this garbage.
Don't buy this CD.
I now know I don't like swedish "metal", but I wouldn't call it metal at all.
I feel sorry for anyone who thinks this band is any good.
This band sucks.
I hate this band.
This has very, very stupid alternative lyrics and melodic guitars.
Itsucks, it's stupid, it's pointless ....
In Flames is worse than this review.
Swedish metal should be renamed retarded boring crap.
Swedish metal sucks.
I'm so angry at this band I can't even write a coherent review.

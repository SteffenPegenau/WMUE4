Reckless Abandon- FunnyThat's as far as I got.
First Date- We can all relate to this one4.
Stay Together For The kids- Sad8.
Just recently have I started liking Blink.
I still don't like them that much though.
Roller Coaster- bad9.
Blink 182 is just a sell out band really wanting to Green Day, who in my opinion are a million times better.
Online Songs- To messy, badly written, badly sung3.
The Rock Show- Good vid, too overrated7.
Anthem Part Two- Better than Anthem part one2.
Story Of A Lonely Guy- The best on this album6.
Happy Holidays, You Bastard- Oh My God.HAHAHAHA5.
I got "TOYPAJ" hoping it would be really good, but it's not.
Here is my song by song review of Blink's latest album:1.
Overall, not very good, too poppy, they need to think punk and they could be VERY good.

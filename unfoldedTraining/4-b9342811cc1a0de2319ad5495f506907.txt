No need to buy one.
It takes about 10 min to heat up.
So that was nice.
The maker has one on the maker and its perfect.
I would suggest that you buy espresso shot glasses, a frothing pitcher and frothing thermometer.
Those will make it your espresso maker much more better.
I use it everyday!
I worked at Starbucks for 3 years so this maker was easy to use and fast.
If you know how to use an espresso maker or not this one is really pretty easy to use.
This is a great maker for everyday use and if you are looking for something simple and easy.
The maker also makes very good foam and very fast.
I love it!
I did notice after making 2 or 4 coffees you have to fill up the water in the back of the maker.
My husband bought this espresso maker for me for christmas this year.
Dont wast your money on a tamper.
The maker its self doesnt look cheap.
That was everyother day for me so its not that bad.
You dont even really need to try to make the foam it does it on it own.

IF THIS VIDEO GAME IS GONNA BE HARD, IT SHOULD AT LEAST BE RATED T.DO NOT GET THIS GAME.
THE GAME IS TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BE BEATEN.
I HATE SWIMMING GAMES!
THE "UNDER THE SEA" WORLD IS VERY HARD.
ALSO, THEY COME UP WITH THE WORST NAMES I CAN THINK OF.
THE "ALICE IN WONDERLAND" WORLD IS VERY STUIPED!
THE STORY IS OK.
(...) FINAL FANTASY IS BIZZARE, STUIPED, AND DOSN'T MAKE SENSE AT ALL.
WHAT DOES DISNEY HAVE TO DO WITH FINAL FANTASY?
IF YOU PUT MOVIES LIKE ALICE IN WONDERLAND OR PINOCHIO INTO A VIDEO GAME, YOU CAN BE SURE THAT SOMETHING TOTALLY STUIPED WILL HAPPEN.
NO MATTER HOW CURIOUS YOU ARE!
AND AGAIN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT A KEYHOLE IS.FIRST OF ALL, DISNEY HAS THE STUIPEDEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME.
BUT THE WHOLE IDEA OF GOOFY AND DONALD DUCK WITH A SWORD IS BEYOND STUIPED.
FINAL FANTASY IS A LITTLE BIT TOO CHALLENGING.
I MEAN, COME ON!
IT'S STUIPED THAT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT WITH KEY!
THE SEA WITCH IS EVEN HARDER.
PUT THEM TOGETHER AND YOU HAVE TOTAL CONFUSION.

So when he gets into a big boy bed we will get him the turtle.
The light on the clock is so bright it acts as a night light so when the stars on the ladybug turn off in her room her "night light" clock is still on.
It was very frustrating in the beginning to find that it shuts off after 45 min.
We have had it for a yr now and are ready for another one as the buttons are starting to sink in and stick.
It's so pretty.
She is 4yrs old now.
Wheeee!
My daughter loves her lady bug!
He is such a good sleeper that i don't want to mess with our routine by putting a distraction like this in his room.
We use the blue and green.
I solved that problem by purchasing a homedics alarm clock/sound machine combo!
We have an 18 mth old son who just loves the starts too.
My daughter would cry in the dark and we'd have to go in and turn it back on.

LOVE THESE!!!!
It sits at the foot of her Full size bed and stars glow on her entire ceiling.

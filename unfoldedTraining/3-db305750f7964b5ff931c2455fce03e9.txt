Pretty boys abound here so the ladies won't be disappointed.Brad Pitt is, at best, a mediocre actor.
The action sequences are entertaining.
No one looks more handsome wielding a sword.
He scored big in 12 monkeys, but that was oh so long ago.
OK, that's about it.
Most of the visuals are pretty good.
No one pouts better than him.
Seems they were taking the meaning of epic very seriously.
Still, don't look for Mr. Pitt around Oscar time.I'm pretty disappointed with Orlando Bloom.
The rest is normal Hollywood summer film fodder.
Troy is easily an hour too long.
Big stars in a low-substance film.
The fact that he uses a bow and arrow in Troy doesn't separate him from his Legolas role does it?
If they weren't going to make a good film, then at least they would make a long one.Not all of Troy is so bad.
This elf should try his hand at some serious roles and leave action behind for awhile.

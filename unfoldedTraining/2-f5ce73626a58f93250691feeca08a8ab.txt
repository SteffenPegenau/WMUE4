Could not use at all.
Too late to return either.
It looks and sounds great but was totally useless to me.
Will end up donating to Goodwill with warning note.
Comes with english, spanish, and french instructions.
WARNING!
Had to go to Home Depot and get a similiar looking porch light.
Unfortuntely you cannot twist the base to line up the screw holes.
My old porch light had two wires.
Perhaps the mounting plate is European.
This one has four.
I bought this light to replace my old porch light and the screws would not align with the existing screw holes into my brick wall.
Probably for the light sensor and control to switch it on at dusk to light.
This does not come with the U.S. standard mounting plate.
You have to screw on the plate on against the outside wall, then slip the screws through the light base, then into the mounting plate.

If you are not a big Beatle fan you may not even notice.
No.
I am a huge Beatle fan.
Yes.
Biggest difference is Long & Winding Road without the Phil Spector orchestration.
Yes, there are some slight difference in mix, guitar riffs and some lyrics.
So, that being said and with all the hype around this CD I was expecting a lot more.
As a collectible?
The second disc are snippets from the movie, i.e., chatter, incidental music, etc.
A big shrug and a ho-hum.
All in all, is this a must have disc to listen to versus the original Let It Be recording?
It's worth owning as a historical document especially if you are really into Beatle history.
But they are low key differences and will not blow you away.
All of the songs are virtually as they were on the original recordings.
My reaction?

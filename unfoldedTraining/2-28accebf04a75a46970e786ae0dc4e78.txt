It's a boring math, nothing that sparks an excitement.
I'm a big fan of Metheny's guitar...But this album really shows who he is musically.
If so, this is not about music, this is about research and science.
So, unfortunately this album did not any touch with the real.
Music is the truth, you either reach it or you don't.
It's probably the most artificial of his career, in the full meaning of "art" as not natural...I'm giving 2 stars because it's Metheny, but that's it...I know he can do much better, connect through your heart, Pat!
What can I say.
Why changing keys with no point to it?
He's a master guitar player, with beautiful phrases, tone, experiments, etc...
The music that touches people's hearts?
Is it just fun with the math?
But here is a question to Pat: Where is the music?
It exists regardless how and what methods we're trying to research it with.
Or why using harmonies filled with holes and emptiness?
But to add to it, it's not even interesting...

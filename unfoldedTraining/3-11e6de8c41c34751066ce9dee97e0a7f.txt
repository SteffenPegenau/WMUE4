It's an Astaire and Rogers movie, what is there to say?
The plot serves only to link the dancing numbers, and I suppose the comedy is funny at times.
Swing Time is the 1936 Astaire and Rogers film that pairs the two together for the sixth time, and they dance!
That's really all I can say about Swing Time.
The musical numbers are well put together and the film is enjoyable to watch.
Alright, whatever, I'll review it.
Singing and Dancing ensue.
No, not at all.
In my mind, it's just a blur of dances and songs.
If you enjoy dancing movies, it's great!
Guy meets girl, they break up, guy gets girl back.
Christ, what else can you really say about it?
Is it bad?
I wish I could say more about it, but it gets very samey.
You either like films about two people dancing or you don't.
If they don't, they don't!

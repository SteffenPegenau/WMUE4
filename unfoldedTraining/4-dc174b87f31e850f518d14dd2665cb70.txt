It aint no Zuiko, but it aint no $900 either.
Just figured Id use the buzz word) so I decided to pick one up.
I have the 50-200 too, but this one is much quieter, and produces a generally better picture.
Or sleep around lenses?
I paid right around $200 dollars for my 50-200 Sigma.
Dosent make sense.
Are there crawl around lenses?
I noticed that another reviewer was dissapointed with this lens on an E500.
The 50-200 Zuiko was around $1200 but I hear it has dropped in price.
I use the lens on my E1 and could not be happier.
This lens looked like the perfect fit for a walk around lens (whatever the hell that means.
Maybe his meter was set wrong?
Maybe that body uses a different metering system?
I have been amazed at the results it produces for just over $200 dollars.
Why dont you too?
They can stick them until they hit around 4 bills.
Sharp as a tack, and great contrast.
I wrote to Sigma and told them that I would gladly pay another C note or two for more quality and speed.

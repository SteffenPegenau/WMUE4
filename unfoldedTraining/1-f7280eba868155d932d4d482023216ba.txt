Sorry, I thought this company had its act together.
It took me a month to isolate problems after installing Crucial memory in the computer.
Sorry, I can't recommend other scanner.
The essiscsi.dll dissapeared from the registry.
The slide stuff does not work at all.
Bought what EPSON recommended, the Belkin 2.0 card.
Then, reinstall one by one, take the new memory out to make it work at 72 dpi.
That's all, folks.
It froze the EPSON Smart Panel.
Not very happy with their service and products.
The new SmartPanel and Twain driver from the epson.com does not work in Windows ME.
Go somewhere else.
The ecbteg.dll and ebpport.dll could not be found.
Bad service support and response.
I will not buy any more Epson products any longer.
Or use at your own risk.
A big major project and a waste of time.
Had to uninstall the Epson scanner, printer, belkin card, and clean registry with utility program.

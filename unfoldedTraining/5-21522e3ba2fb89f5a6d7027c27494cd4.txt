It was a nice little broadway show you didn't have to get dressed up to see and get all fancy.
hehe It has an upbeat tempo at times and others a real down and mellow tune.
It's like a huge dream of mine.
Well I just want to say I love it.
They should see "How Lucky They Are" to even be on broadway at all for sometime.
It was nice for kids and adults.
:)
Too bad it went off the road.
Even if it went bye bye bye.
I'm 15, 14 at the time, and it for my first time seeing a broadway show, I liked it.
I saw the musical with Aaron carter in it, well that wasn't the best thing, I would have rather seen the regular JoJo but other than that I thought it was great!
But much luck to the casr in future broadway.
The songs are great!
I love "Alone in the Universe" because I can actually relate to that song on some terms.
I think that's why they were putting famous in, to help keep it going but that didn't work.

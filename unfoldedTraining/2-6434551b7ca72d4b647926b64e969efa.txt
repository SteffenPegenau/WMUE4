Bruce Barnes death scene loses its value due to having to get a different actor than the guy from the first 2 movies.
Nicholae has none of his staff from Tribulation force.
Buck has no GNN to work for.
They are all gone.
Nicholae and Buck never meet in this one.
Best way to sum it up, It feels like a Lou Gossett Jr. movie with Buck and the cast as guest stars instead of the other way around.So Terribly Sad as Nicholae would say.
Brad Johnson does nothing but stand around and deliver lines.
I loved the first 2 movies but this was a major disappointment.
He has nothing to do.
Where is Ben Judah?
Where is Bob Carlisle and his influence on the music?
What happened to IVEY?
Where is Heim?
no explanation!
I didn't wait all this time for Left Behind 3 to see special effects.
This movie could have been so good.
Slow dead mumbled movie with a few great special effects.

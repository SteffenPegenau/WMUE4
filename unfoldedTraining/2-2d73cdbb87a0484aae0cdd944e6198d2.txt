Um... what?
They say it's your problem, not a phone problem.
Thump the screen.
And there's NO WAY to clean it out.I've had my phone for 5 weeks and I started noticing dust on the screen that I couldn't clean off.
)Oh, and if you google "Dust inside razor phone screen," you'll see that lots and lots and lots of people have this problem.Oh yeah, one more thing, Motorola will NOT fix the phone for you.
So I took it to a Cingular store and they said, "Oh, well just thump the screen until the dust falls to the bottom."
Neither will Cingular.
"That was it.
That's when I noticed that the dust was under the screen, not on it.
the static on the inside of the screen holds the dust like a magnet.
That's their answer to this problem.
And then they said, "Or, just don't carry it in your pocket.
Even if you have insurance.
OK, if you keep this phone in your pocket, you WILL get lint and dust UNDER the screen.
(it doesn't work, btw.

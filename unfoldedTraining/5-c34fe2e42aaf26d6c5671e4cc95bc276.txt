I really can't put AFI into a specific genre.
My favorite song is "This Time Imperfect" which is hidden at the end.
I had to get the c.d.
The lyrics are deep and really well written.
Then "The Leaving Song Part 2" came out and I loved that song.
When I first heard "Girl's not Grey" I thought it wa good, but not great.
I listened to it, and it was good.
on the radio and knew nothing about their indy career.
This is my all time favorite c.d.
But, I kept going back to it and soon I was absolutley hooked.
I listen to it 2 to 3 times a day.
I love Davey's singing voice and his screaming voice.
Can't wait to hear more.
I first heard of A.F.I.
They uniquely mix punk rock with electronics, but it also has a dark, almost gothic feel.

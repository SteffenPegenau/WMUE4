Oh, and did I mention the AFFORDABLE price??
No more whatever created on the floor after washing.
I had one for over 1 1/2 years and it's still going strong.
It gets under pedestal tables!!!
No more dust in the air.
Brooms just spreads all the dust and dirt around.
And the corners!!!!
The CLOTH w/vac makes all the difference in the world.
And how it gets the edges!!!!
It gets behind toilets!!!
It gets all the fine particles left behind.
I love this product.
WAIT I NEED TO DO A BACK FLIP!
Don't have to move chairs it gets around the legs!
The 'bare floor' settings on big / expensive vaccumn cleaners cannot compete with this little wonder.
It's just a little bit of heaven on earth for me.
I bought another one so I have one ready to go when one runs out of juice (which it does in my house-2 dogs, 2 granddaughters, and I live in the inner inner dusty city.)

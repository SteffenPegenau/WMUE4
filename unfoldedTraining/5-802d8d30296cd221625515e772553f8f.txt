When I first heard Clay Aiken I knew he was special.
I just didn't know how special.
You are a wonderful and special artist and person.
I love his version of Bridge Over Troubled Water which is not a song that had previously appealed to me.
I will continue to support Clay in anything he chooses to undertake.
I know some people say that the choir overpowers him too much, but to me I hear him just fine.
He is right on with his delivery.
His voice is pure, clear and precise.
The more I watched him on American Idol the clearer it became.
Keep up the great job Clay.
Sing on Clay!
He is one awesome talent and his future looks awfully bright.
!
This Is The Night is a beautiful song as well.
He has amazing range.
Clay did a marvelous job on this as well.
In fact I would venture to say that this is the first time I have felt this way about any artist.
He has made a true fan out of me and that is not something that is easy to do.

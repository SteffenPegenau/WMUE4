Josh sounded worse and worse.
It was awful.
His voice was bad.
Everything about him is different including the way he sings.
Puhleeze make it stop.Okay, back to Josh.
At one point the camera shows us TWO flabby women jumping up and down and screaming like teens watching Justin Timberlake.
Why on earth did he re-do "Canto Alla Vita?
Really bad.
Sounded kinda froggy.
Of course it was during one of their endless pledge drives.NOW I know what everyone is complaining about!
Ewwweeeee.
Too bad.
Instead of adding the hot My Confession from Closer, he did To Where You Are.
I saw Josh Groban's Live at the Greek concert on Public Television a few days ago.
This whole concert was nuts with all those screaming middle-aged women making fools of themselves and making the concert even more awful.
Another puhleeze, make it stop!Like that energizer bunny, it kept going and going.
I wouldn't have believed it but Josh looks terrible and sounds worse.

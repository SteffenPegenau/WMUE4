I can't think of enough good things to say about this album.
This guy is probably one of the best guitarists alive, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a huge fan.
.
Meet Giant Robot and join him in his battle against the evil Guillatine .
.
.
.
.
Hear Buckethead duel Bansheebot, utilizing his mastery of the deadly sonic arts .
.
Pop in this CD and prepare for a musical journey through Bucketheadland, Buckethead's imaginary theme park filled with monsters, robots, and rides that don't have names .
And not only do we have a great theme album here, but get a load of Buckethead's guitar skills!
It's certainly not what anyone, even a real Buckethead fan, would expect; but that's true of every Buckethead release I've ever heard.
I'll wrap this up with three words: BUY THIS CD!
His passages range from dark and mysterious to heavy and grinding to silly and fun to just plain mind-numbingly UNBELIEVEABLE!

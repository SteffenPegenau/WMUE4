Buy the book to see how the story turns out.
They are selfish.
Most people do.
They remember them for their beauty, grace, and magic.
I give it 5 stars :).
The only reason why they dont kill things right away is because it is so much fun to tourture them.
However this is all a matter of perception.
But all people remember is their beauty.
They have Class.
Granny Weatherwax is smarter than most though.
They have Style.
They take and take and give nothing back except their merry laughter at how pathetic you are.
Which they do have.
They are cruel.
The truth is elves are unbeliveably cruel.
She knows elves for what they are and would rather die than see them take over her town.
And you are animals.
The power of the elves lies in them making you think that they are better than you will ever be.

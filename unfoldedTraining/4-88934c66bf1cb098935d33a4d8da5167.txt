SO, we're keeping it and letting his parents worry about it.
There was always some part that didn't fold in right.
When we got it, we opened it to see how it was.
!
We did 20 tries of expanding and contracting and only 2 times did it go smoothly.
I bought this item for my nephew who is a space-fiend.
It's fairly easy to expand... the contracting back to normal is a bit problematic though.
Its merely a hoberman sphere like you see everywhere now-a-days but with paper in between filling in the gaps.
But what are aunts for if not for spoiling?
If it isn't space related, he doesn't want a thing to do with it.
I figured I woudl buy this brand new Hoberman Space Dome.
For 40 bucks, I would suggest getting something else though....
It is a great looking to with lots of information.
I don't think it will last 2 weeks past christmas.
It's a great looking toy and when fully expanded, I think he will enjoy so much.

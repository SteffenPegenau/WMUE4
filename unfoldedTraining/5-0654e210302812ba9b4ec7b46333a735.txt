Stephan Forte is a world class musician, not just a great guitarist.
Buy this album, I HIGHLY recommend it!
His range and power is phenominal.
Unlike most classical rockers, which tend to have the same drum beat in every song, Adagio maintains the ever changing element of Prog.
I consider him one of the best singers in the genre.
There is a very strong classical presence here, especially with the keys.
His solos are tasty, yet display a measure of melodic restraint.
Again, not the typical constant doublebass that many power metal bands use.
All the songs are great, but "Second Sight" really gets the album off to a good start is is the most solid song on the album.
I love it when my expectations are surpassed.
Adagio was an experiment for me.
The drums are also very strong.
Singer David Readman is awesome.
Every song on this disc is really awesome.
There may be an ever-so-slight Symphony X flavor, but Adagio is certainly unique.
The keys are very strong as well.

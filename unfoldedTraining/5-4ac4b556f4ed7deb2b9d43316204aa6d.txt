That's nonsense!
You'll notice anywhere between a quarter to a half inch of play depending on the power of the saw.
This prevent it from snapping when or if the blade gets caught.
So, it was designed with about a half inch of play to move up and down.
In fact, check out any other sawzall and wiggle the blade.
You see, the blade only flexes on the flat part, moving back and forth.
This thing is bad ass!
The mean green machine will not be beat!
I own many sawzalls, and let me tell you, this thing will out cut any of them.
I believe this beast will beat anything on the market.
Capeesh?
With regards to the previous posters remarks about a loose blade and the "vertical plane".
!
The power is enormous.
It'll cut threw anything like butta.
It's designed to keep the blade from snapping due to the overwhelming power of this machine.

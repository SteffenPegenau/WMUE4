I was disappointed that there was almost no INFORMATION.
How did they buy their jeep?
How did they arrange camping?
I was curious about costs (they mentioned they did not fish private waters that cost 300 US dollars per day).
I was glad I watched, but thought the video could have been much more.
What roads were they on?
In summary, I recommend the video, but if you view it, expect to have many unanswered questions.
I want to go to Patagonia.
It seemed to have a bit more narration.
How did they learn about them?
I could seldom tell exactly where they were, they did not describe what permissions, if any, they needed to fish in specific areas, they did not discuss gear, etc.
What new patterns did they learn about?
Under what conditions did they use nymphs vs dry flies vs streamers?
And so forth.
The video is very interesting, with wonderful footage of catching fish.
Be sure to watch the bonus section.
What US fly patterns worked?
They did show many of the flies they used.

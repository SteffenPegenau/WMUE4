This year we were blessed.
The author looks like a mass murderer on the back cover.
I had never heard of it before.
I would definitely cover that page, as a parent.
It is very sad.
That one is scary!
It has been many years since I had a small child in my family.
One suggestion I would have.
When we were supposed to take a book to the shower, I asked several friends with small children to recommend a book.
The parent would have to judge that.
I was very surprised it was so widely known.
I know nothing about children's books.
I'm not sure what would be a good age for the child to have this book read to them.
Everyone recommended this one.
As the author-have a new photo taken.

Jack and Meg's styles have made this band sound different and unique.
Not any other music group can be compared to them.My favorite songs include Seven Nation Army, Ball and Biscuit, and Hypnotize.
It's the quality that makes this album outstanding.
There is a mix of slow songs, fast songs, and just plain ole rock!
I think Jack is a great guitar player.
Jack can really play a mean guitar.
The last song, "Well It's True That We Love One Another" , is a great song that reminds me of the Mama's and the Papa's....
Meg White may [stink] at singing, but hey, that doesn't bother me.
It's not the best, but its fun to listen to.
Meg sings in the song, "In the Cold, Cold, Night".
I know and understand much about music, and their styles are different.
I remember watching the band perform each day of one week on Conan O'Brien.
It's not how simple it is, or how difficult it is either.
The White Stripes are an interesting band.
This is a must own album for any rock n roll fan.

The Bose phones sound are very good, comfort is a 9 out of 10, but quality is a complete joke.
I'm sure Bose knows about the problem and want you to do the $150.00 upgrade.
I have a Grado SR-60 and Shennheiser 595HD and they are much more durable.
Went to Bose store in Burlington Mass for a new cable cause it was intermitent.
I would try some other noise cancelling phones first before going to Bose.
Problem no 1.
$300 for cheap plastic.
I used them almost every day for couple of years and it is still in perfect condition.
Trapped so I did the upgrade for $150.00.
Problem 2.
Brought it home and where it piviots, completed disintergrated in my hands.
The cabling should be alot sturdier then what is given.
Anyway, I did buy the QC15.
I was doing nothing but holding it in my hands and put it on the table.
What a joke!
I've had the grado for 5 years and it is still new looking.

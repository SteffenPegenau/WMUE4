But not much more.
If you're reading this review, you've heard it before: Goodkind is a horrible writer.
To sum it up, Goodkind is a freak.
I wouldn't say horrible; but certainly a bad writer.
Terry Goodkind knows how to write a page-turner.
It's not the absurdity of it.
But I won't go into the details about that.
It's the colossal amount of cheek he must have to write this garbage.
What I will say, though, is that life is too short to read thousand-page novels where the author, with an apparently perfectly straight face, writes about a "chicken that was not a chicken."
I read bad writing all the time.
What I refuse to read, however, is work from writers who refuse to let a story tell itself, and instead force the story through a philosophical mold in their head to the detriment of the reader's enjoyment.
I'll give him that.
I love absurdities.
And this book is a freak's book.
Even then, I don't mind bad writers.

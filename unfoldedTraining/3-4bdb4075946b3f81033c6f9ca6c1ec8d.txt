They fit entirely in her mouth which is scary.
However, I'm not as crazy about it as she is.
All the water in it makes it really heavy.
I have this and I think it is a much better toy, and is almost the exact same thing.
The little sea creatures are about an inch long, and my daughter thinks it's so funny to "eat" them, just like the pelican does.
Also, the "rear" of the bird has a hole that lets the sea creatures fall out as soon as she (finally) gets them in the mouth.
There is a K's Kids Pelican that is not a bath toy that is the same thing only LARGER and plush.
I have to watch her like a hawk with the little critters.
This is a really cute bath toy which my 1 1/2 year old daughter loves.
Too heavy for her to handle.
Very discouraging.
It is much smaller than it looks.
The pelican fills with water in every crack and crevace, and takes forever to drain out.
Get the plush one.
I have taken the pelican out of the tub and put it away since she doesn't even play with it.

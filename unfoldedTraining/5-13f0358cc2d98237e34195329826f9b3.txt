An innocent kid growing up fast on the road with a 70's rock band.
He is something special.
Almost Famous is a masterfully written and acted film.
This film is full of life, emotion and great music from the 60's and 70's.Kate Hudson has got to be the most amazing woman on the planet.
I don't understand why anyone would say this.
!
Get it now!!
Every actor in this film gets an A+ from me.One of the best films I have seen in years.
Just one look in to this girls big blue eyes makes me melt every time I see her.
Some reviewers describe Almost Famous as a "comedy".
And newcomer Patrick Fuget is one heck of a actor in his own right.
WOW, what a beautifully talented soul Kate Hudson is.
And a great DVD with lots of options.
It, in some strange way, reminded me of that old TV show "The Wonder Years".
AF has its laughs but this is NO COMEDY.

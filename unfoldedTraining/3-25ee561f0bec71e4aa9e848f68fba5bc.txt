And then they complain b/c the men didn't have "feelings" for them.
I don't know.
Whatever.
No one forced them to blow (literally) their money.
I just see the pitfalls of stupidity.
Am I really supposed to feel sorry for these girls?
Uh, they are call girls.
They weren't beaten/forced into prostitution by sick fathers/boyfriends.
And now I'm supposed to feel sorry for them?
They chose to become high priced call girls.
They were beautiful young girls who willingly used their bodies to gain entry to celebrities, money, parties, drugs.
It IS all about their sexy bodies.
This book is supposed to make us aware of the pitfalls of prostitution.
They brag about the perks, the money, the drugs.
Sure, one of them was definately abused as a young teen, but for the most part these girls were not victims of men.
It was entertaining reading, but didn't dredge up the sympathy that it was supposed to.
They willingly spent their money on drugs.
They were their own worst enemies.
It IS all about sex.

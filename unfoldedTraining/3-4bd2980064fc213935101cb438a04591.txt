These brake pads apparently were suppose to fit my car.
When i was ready to replace the pads themselves.
The Amazon page said "This product fits your 2008 Cadillac CTS" When i received it, I started work on replacing my brake pads.
I was really excited to try these new ceramic pads, too bad.
FAILED!
My car does have the performance package from the dealer yet the pads were too long.
Im giving this a average rating review only because i wasn't able to test them out.This is the first time i bought these pads.
I drive a 2008 Cadillac CTS 3.6DI.
The page also mentioned it fits 2008 Cadillac CTS with performance package?
I decided to finally change the brake pads my self.
Amazon allowed me to enter the type of car i own in their garage.
I realized the Hawk Pads were too long.
Maybe they meant the Cadillac CTS-V?
I'm not sure what that means.
Oh wells im going to return these and try the wagner brake pads that fits the 2008 Cadillac CTS w/o Performance package.

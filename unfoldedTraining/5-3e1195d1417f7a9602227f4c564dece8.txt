This is as interactive as it gets.
The wife Allison goes into denial about the whole thing and believes her daughter is still alive.
Based on the novel of the same name by Andrew Neiderman; TENDER LOVING CARE is the story of a young couple that recently lost there doughter in a car accidet.
It's not for everyone.
It's more like macarb, dark, and cruel.
BUY IT!
That is NOT true!
This movie is not tender nor is it loving nor is it caring.
I have read reviews that say that there was little interactivity and that the questions were irrelevant to the movie.
A nurse named Kythryn is hired to help.
The husbend ,Michael, turns to the famaly psychiatrist for help.
But there is evidence that she has accepted the job for all the wrong reasons.
Your awnsers to the quistions shape the story and ending.
You are asked a series of questions.
This is where you come in.
But it's still realy great!
The endings range from depressing to gloomy and don't be fooled by the title.

This movie should definitely have gotten at least a PG-13 rating.
I was horrified sitting there watching the movie with my 5 year old daughter.
Not a "family" movie.
"What are they doing in the bed?"
Why did he look at her like that?"
UP is a family movie.... Finding Nemo is a family movie.
Only thing is it is NOT a family movie.
No idea what they were thinking with this rating.
Light language, many issues with sex, borderline nudity, not a movie to have your 6 year old see without having a talk about death, sex and how adults (mostly men) act and what they do, meaning sex.
I recommend it completely.
This was a very funny movie!
Even Shrek is a family movie.
"what did he just say?'
Shame on them.um.... other than that, a great funny, sappy movie, and people should see it, just not children.
Touches base with mostly adult reality.

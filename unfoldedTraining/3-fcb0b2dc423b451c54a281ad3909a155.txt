Bought these a few months ago to add on another unit.
I have lost only one tip in almost two years of using this style earphones.
Outrageous!
I am supposed to spend half of what these cost to get a simple rubber tip replaced?
I lost one of the little rubber tips.
The cord tangles easy and there is a little rub noise when the cable is moved but I hardly notice it.
I emailed Sennheiser because I was unable to locate replacements.
I would think Sennheiser would be ashamed of this idea.
Overall, I like these ALOT.
All they can sell me is the tips by the bag, 10 pieces per bag for $18!
I need one, not an expensive bag of ten!
I guess I would probably need to add who knows what for shipping and maybe tax.
The problem?
They have lost a customer over what is probably a fifteen cent piece of rubber.
The Sennheisers sound excellent.
I also use Sony 51's which I like alot and have served well for over a year now.

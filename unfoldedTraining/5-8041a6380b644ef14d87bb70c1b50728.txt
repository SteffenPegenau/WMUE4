I had the honor of meeting Patty after a small concert in Hampton, VA. She is an amazing woman, so gracious.
YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!
Patty, THANK YOU for the unparalleled beauty that is your music.
It's spectacular!
Please, come back to Virginia.
It's one of the best CDs ever.
BUY LIVING WITH GHOSTS AND FLAMING RED!
I can't wait to hear Silver Bell.
Second, what more can I say about Living With Ghosts that has not already been said.
Forfgiveness will move you to tears.
Everything she does is pure poetry.
She and her band (great musicians) put on a show that exceeds any and all expectations.
Every Little Bit is SO powerful.
Not Alone is my favorite song of all time.
First of all, don't listen to anyone who says that Flaming Red isn't amazing.

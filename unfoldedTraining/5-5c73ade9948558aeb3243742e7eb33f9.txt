You wont be dissapointed.

I love books based on the supernatrual, and this book definatly hits my top 10 fave books.
Im 15, and read Amelia's first book, In the Forest of the Night, about 5 months ago, but was only able to buy this great sequal recently.
It can't be."
And I am soo glad shes coming out with a new book.
She is definatly the Anne Rice of a new Generation.
And let me tell ya, I love it.
In the middle of reading it I thought "Oh no!
I prefer it better then the 1st book, which had a great story, but this one...

I was almost worried she wasn't.
So girls, GO FOR IT!
I just finished this book ten minutes ago!
I wouldn't suggest this book to guys though, becuase it's mainly about a romance, between a hot hunk of a vampire, and mortal girl.

Some surprises, but no feeling of suspense or expectation.
But the script was bad.
Acting was back-and-forth.
The characters needed to evolve more from the opening to the ending.
It's as if almost nothing happened at all, just a lot of activity.
Great directing, cinematography, excellent visual quality, lots of style, audio quality, editing, enjoyable score.
A lot of activities occurred, but the story didn't really progress much.
Not horrible, just weak.
Story was muddied, sometimes confusing, meandering.
Other things not done so well.
They each did some very good stuff and some not so good.
Some things carried-off very well, very believable.
No satisfying build-up, climax, then resolution.
You never really cared about any of the characters or what happened in the story.
No single actor was always great or always bad.
We watched it, all felt the same.

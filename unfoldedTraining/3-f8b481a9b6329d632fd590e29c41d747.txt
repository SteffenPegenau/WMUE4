YES, she is married and has children with said husband.
!!!
No steamy scenes.Done w/ this series.
-- so then travels around the country as a knight for hire -- becomes famous for tourney wins ...He struggles to acquire the money to bargain for her and buy land (over 5 years now - he's no sex!)
Hopeless romance.
Liked the characters & LK's writing - but that made it even more dissapointing somehow.Rhys has saved his virginity for Gwen -- a lady above him in station.
no more sex.
0, count them, 0 love scenes.He lives in the castle as her personal guard for 2 years.
Finally after one session of loving (which we do not get to read!)
This story was somewhat depressing for over half of the book.
-- We're really not sure, UM, just how the h*ll is he gonna get the lady from her Lord & Husband.
Gets no sleep from thinking of her!
Noble night.
This author's short story in Tapestry blew me away.
So, I go in search for more.

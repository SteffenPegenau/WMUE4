You do not need to bury the line.
Beau yelped the first 2 times, but learned quick.
He is very sweet, but a roamer and jumper.
For the part across our deck we used staples and attached the wire at the top under the eaves.
When Beau gets close to the wall he won't get shocked because it is further away from the 2-foot distance we set.
We have it along our fence, but buried it past gates.
Only problem is that the neighbor's dog broke it with her nails.
The unit gave a warning that it was broken (a complete loop has to be made).
The pieces were easily spliced together.
We adopted a dog from the shelter.
We called the company to discuss installation.
We feel a lot better now!
This was the best solution for our situation.
Now our sweet Beau stays at home.
Our Vet said he was a great dog but to keep him in the fence buy one of these and crank it all the way up.
He is staying within the boundaries we set (about 2 feet inside the fence).

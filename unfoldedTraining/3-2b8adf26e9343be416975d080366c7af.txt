Amazon has not been very helpful either.
Antonline advised me that I coulsd not return this item.
Last week Amazan finally said to just return it to antonline anyway and if antonline does not refun me in full they would refund me.
Thegps inself however was another story.
I asked if I could return it since it was a christmas gift.
Amazon had me contact antonline to return the GPS.
Amazon uses a sub vendoer.
I bought both a gps mount and a boat gps.
I contacted Amazon and was given instructionso n returning the mount.
I contacted them again and advised that Amazon said I could.
I have always thought Amazon to be a good service company but now I am fed up.
Amazon informed that I could.
This company has ignored me since Christmas 07.
This has been the biggest hassel.
No problems.
My friend alredy had this gift I found out christmas day.

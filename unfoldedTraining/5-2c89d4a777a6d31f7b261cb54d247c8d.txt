Even your favorite artists can put out a few that you have to skip through or program out.
Now it's "discontinued."
The writing AND the music were so original and listenable and poetic and passionate!
I mean wow!
I saw a snippet of Noella Hutton on some Lillith Fair coverage recently.
But wow!
I could not believe it.
It's the best penny I ever spent in my life.
Isn't it just the way of things?
So I spent the one penny plus shipping and handling expecting the worst -- I mean, what can you possibly get for a penny?
I thought it might be one of those buys where I hate one song, scan through a couple others, and sell it before I even hear it once.
Immediately I knew I needed to hear what she has produced.
This piece was incredible ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
I had never heard of her and she sounded intense.
You know how most albums/CD's have a stinker or two?
Ms. Hutton, if you haven't already, PLEASE MAKE MORE MUSIC and grace our collections with your extraordinary gift.

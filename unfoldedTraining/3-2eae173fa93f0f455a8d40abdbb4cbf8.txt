She's not a girly-girl.
In the first book I read (Book of a Thousand Days) it was the same thing- but rats.
(Maybe that's why the Newberry committee made it an honor book?
What is it with Shannon Hale and rabbits?
Is there a quota for the "strong girl as protagonist" story?)
OK, OK, we get it- Miri is a strong, politically correct heroine.
I wish I had counted- there must have been at least 6 occasions where she wanted to be sure she mentioned that the heroine had no problem with slaughtering them.
Admittedly, Hale is a better than average writer.
It reached a point where it distracted from the story.
I gave it 3 stars because of the redundancy.
No.
I was engaged with the plot- but a Newberry Honor book?
Princess Academy was the second book I have read by Shannon Hale, and I don't plan to read any more.
I'm guessing I should expect that from any Hale book- and twice was enough.
It was fine- but not great.

I can't even view my pictures at an event, because the battery wears out so quickly.
ONE TIME!
the amount of charge wears out too fast.
i bought a very cute digital camera at target.
horrible rating for a horrible battery.
i have ordered many online now.
between pictures i have to turn off the camera.
this battery is awful!
when i asked for a spare battery, he told me they dont sell them there!
duracell, you can do better!
it sucks.
on top of all this, you can't find this battery anywhere!
STUPID.
(unless you order it online) it is too expensive for how it performs.
not a good battery to need.
the guy didnt tell me about the battery until i agreed to purchase the camera.
i wish i hadn't bought the camera for 300 bucks!
one battery is between $11 & $14..ordering online gees..$15 to $20.
the only place i have found this battery is at wolf camera.

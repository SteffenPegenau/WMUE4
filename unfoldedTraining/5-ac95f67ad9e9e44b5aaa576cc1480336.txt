All the other baby name books were the same old names.
It's really a fun book to read too.
How many books can you say that about?
Ho-hum BORING!
Talk about magic!
We wanted something different when choosing a name for our baby.
I'm not a Wiccan, just an open minded person.
We both will get a kick out of telling our baby where her name came from.
This book had TONS of them!
I know, who reads a baby name book, right?
I really like this one better.
I guarantee she won't be able to put it down.
But really, it was fun.
Plus I actually learned a ritual to help me get over turning 40!
I learned a lot of neat stuff and Wicca sure looks like it's an interesting religion.
If you know anyone who's expecting, give her this.

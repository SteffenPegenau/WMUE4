Decent sounding Wah, but no on & off switch!
If you bring your foot all the way back it turns off.
If you step on it and move it forward it automatically comes on.
So here are the two main problems with this design.1.
No Fun!2.
Steve Vai must have this position memorized, but those of who don't, can potentially keep turning it on and off.
If you take your foot off, it springs back to the upright position and turns itself off!I'm selling this thing.
If your moving your foot quickly it doesn't seem to do it, but if you are playing a soulful slow solo it cuts in and out every time you move your foot all the way back...Annoying!
What the Heck?
A lot of players like to play for a while with one of those cool tones in the middle.
Ever like to leave the pedal somewhere in the middle?
Take your foot off and play for a while?
Not on this one.
It doesn't do the things that Wah pedals have always done!
If you move your foot all the way back while playing it cuts out!

Nothing at first, but wait!
I thought maybe my TV was messed up.
Went and tried it on our HDTV.
Went through the same troubleshooting.
No picture at all.
Everything was hooked up fine.
Colors were off and the picture was scrambled.
Nothing.
The price was the only good thing about this crap.
Who knows?
Double checked the connections.
Laptop recognized the connection, but nothing.
A picture appears!
Product is garbage.
Hooked this up to the component hookups on my tv.
I'm not wasting another chance on this again.
Maybe I got a bad set.

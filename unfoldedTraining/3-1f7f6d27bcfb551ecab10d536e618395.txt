And a few of the new arrangements are just so so.
It is quite possible I have been listening to them on a daily basis for over 30 years.
There is no passion in the playing.
I recently saw them in concert early October and Ian's voice was even worse.
I'm so dissapointed I am ending this review momentarily.
They gave this CD as a freebie.
Even on a bad night, they are more entertaining and have more talent in their little pinkies than 99% of the perfomers who make it popular today.
I'm a Jethro Tull junkie.
The money is going to a great cause.
With deepest regret, I am being generous by giving this CD a 3 star rating.
I guess, just making an attempt to recreate some early magic is worthy of this recording but.., Ah forget it.
All this being said Jethro Tull is still the greatest musical group of the century.
Buy the CD anyway, if your a fan.
This remake of Aqualung with a live feel to it, is borderline boring.
Ian's throat problems have returned making his voice pretty shoddy.

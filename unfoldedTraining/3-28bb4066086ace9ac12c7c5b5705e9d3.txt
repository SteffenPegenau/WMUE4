I have found that if you put it behind the front license plate with styrofoam over it, it works fine for the outside temperature.
At first, I couldn't get the thermo to work at the right temp.
So I moved it back and everything is OK.
AHA!
So I change to 5 stars!
The compass works great, though.
Battery seems good enough.
Then I changed the location to the front grill and it works!
Does anyone have a suggestion to stabilize the temp?
However, when I am at a light or stopped, the temp then goes way up.
It was always 7 deg higher.
It said "distortion".
As soon as I drive, it goes to the right temp.
I tried to move it closer to me - on the dashboard not on the windshield - and it wouldn't work.
I have not installed the hard wire yet.
I bought this product after seeing the reviews.

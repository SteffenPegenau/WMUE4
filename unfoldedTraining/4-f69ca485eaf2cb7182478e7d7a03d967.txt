I would then edit it and re-record it back onto the camera.
I own a Macintosh also.
I have the 4MB and it holds 32 pictures.
You may also want a larger memory stick if you want to buy one also.
It now records forever before the battery dies.
The resolution is only 640 x 480.
A 16MB would do fine for everday pictures.
The camera has been in Korea then back to the US and then over to Afghanistan.
This camera allowed me to take video footage and import it to my computer.
It is not made for taking pictures but more for recording.
Because it has held up to all of that I give it a 4 star review.
I would either send the movies out over e-mails or put them onto a DVD disk or record then onto a regular VHS.
I did buy a larger battery for it.
I bought this cxamera while stationed in Korea.
This camera has had no problems what so ever.
I hope this review helps someone out.

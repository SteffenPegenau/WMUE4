Indiana Jones--this man is not.

I'm not a brainy-iac, so I don't know whether the wrong latin word was used or whether historical facts were misrepresented.

For a smart man he doesn't a lot of dumb things.
Okay,let's get to the Mach 15 plane.
Plus, these people can run across towns in matter of seconds..maybe a minute.

And I simply didn't believe the whole premise of anti-matter.
First of all, for the first third of the book I didn't understand why the hero in this story was contacted in the first place.

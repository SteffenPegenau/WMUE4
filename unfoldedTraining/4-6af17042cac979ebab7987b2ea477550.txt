If you just like good music performed well... its not perfect, but I'm glad I bought it.
Is styx after money?
If you are a Styx purist, avoid it (but don't whine about it's existence either).
No.
It is worth the ticket price for Man in the Wilderness and Castle Walls alone (tho there are many other highlights).
The guy taking DDY place does not sing as well, but isn't as dramatic (a plus in my mind).
I watched this dvd back to back with Return to Paradise.
Does it matter?
Yes- like it or not, rock music is a business.
The music is great.
Tommy Shaw's energy and guitar playing, not to mention his seemingly unchanged voice, carry the whole show.
Other than that, this is a great set for only 15 bucks.
I don't care much for JYs gutteral singing, but to re-create PoE, I suppose it was necessary.
Both are good, but neither is really superior to the other.
I read a lot of the reviews of this dvd, but must say I don't know what all the hoopla is about.

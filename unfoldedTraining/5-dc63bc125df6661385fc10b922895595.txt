Heck, I've even ended a friendship with someone who said they hated this movie; anybody with taste that bad can't be a good person to have as a friend.
Go watch Mean Girls!
It's my best friend's favorite movie.
And again!
Here's a dumb review: how could you not already know how incredibly perfect this movie is?
Why are you still reading this?
If you're still here, thanks for listening.
Go watch Mean Girls!
Now, go watch it again!
Go watch it with someone you love -- even better, go watch it with someone you'd like to love you.
It works.
In case you haven't figured it out, it's my favorite movie.
Trust me.
It's my mother's favorite movie.
It's my wife's favorite movie.
I sure have: I'm over thirty viewings now, and life is too short to waste time reading something so obvious as this review.

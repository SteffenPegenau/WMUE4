I can only hope they correct their mistakes and put out another live CD.
Who selected these cuts?
As I listened to this CD, I wondered if I had hyped it too much in my mind.
Why not one of his trademark rants?
Where are the elaborate intros to Sweet Child, Paradise City, Knockin' On Heaven's Door.
This CD does not have 1/10 the energy of that show.
What about Coma, Don't Damn Me, Double Talkin' Jive, Garden of Eden, Civil War, etc.
They blew the roof off of the Assembly Center.
Why do we hear Axl asking the crowd to move back from the stage.
This time I will listen to it first.
Across the Universe?
Where and when were these songs recorded?
I saw GnR in Baton Rouge in 1992.
What is that?
They rocked for 3 1/2 hours.
Anything but Move to the City.

It is very intimate music.
The band still survives though.
Lily Wolfe plays the organ and makes a lot of noise.
Before they were like a lot of New York bands who grew up on David Lynch and Nick Cave and wore suits.
Now they are like an American Arab Strap, very personal and very original.
Maybe before they sounded like this weird atmospheric band.
Now they incorporate more American roots music.
Their music has a lot in common with those bands.
They are romantic and tragic.
Parker Noon and Lily Wolfe have been a couple for ten years too.
Parker and Lily have played with Interpol and Future Bible Heroes.
They have retreated to their neutral corners.
Parker's signature vocals have a lot of echo on them.
This album was so intense in the making that they broke up afterwards.
Parker and Lily are a band from Athens, Georgia and who have spent some time in Brooklyn, NY.
This album is much better than the previous ones.

But if you turn off the printer, expect to wait another 30-40 seconds when you press print.Can I person wait that long?
I wish I liked the printer more.
30-40 seconds later, it's ready and actually starts to print the document.
It prints good and crisp.
When I put something in the queue to print, the printer does this "pre warmup" routine.
I've had the printer for over a year now.
Nothing to complain about that.
Then if you print another document, it loads up and prints without the buzzing and whirring.
Little motors start a turnin'.
But there is one gripe that I'll mention.
How long does his sanity last?
But waiting so long to print a document is tiresome.
It hasn't failed me yet.
Whirring, whirring and more whirring.
Works great with my Mac, too.

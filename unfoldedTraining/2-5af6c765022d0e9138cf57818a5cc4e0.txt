put together in another country and probably by someone not entirely familiar with the English language.
i fear that today i will waste more time trying to get it to work.
do you carry the manual with you.
i never could get it to sync with outlook.
price-wise, it was great.
however, it would appear that the designer of this organizer tried to put so many features into it that it ends up doing nothing well.
.
don't purchase this, you'll be sorry.
Punch this button to get to this screen which will take you to the next screen, ad nauseum.
in this case, you get what you pay for.
truly disappointed with this worthless plastic.
Just not worth it.
they are extremely difficult to follow.
the directions are terrible.
Seldom am I this disapointed in a product but this one is truly the exception.
i owned one of the first palm pilots and it was much easier in comparison.
i bought this one on ebay and thought i was getting a good deal.

It sounds like someone is choking her on every song on this stupid CD.
Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage!!
She does the same thing over and over again and people keep eating it up.
It just asks to be made fun of.
!
Buy here albun, Try This, instead.
She is not a pop star and she is not the next madonna.
God only knows why she would title a song "Me Against the Music".
Britney Spears is probably the most awful thing to hit music within the last 20 years.
Pink is awesome.
She cannot sing at all.
She is so terrible that it is painful to listen to her.
Like "I'm a Slave 2 U" is so much like "Me Against the Music".
She is so afraid to try new things.
Pink is the next madonna, becuase Pink keeps re-inventing herself, where as britney is too afraid to even change her hair color!

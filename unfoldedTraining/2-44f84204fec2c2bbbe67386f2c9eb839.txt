I do think of Forgive Them Father quite often.
The lyrcial content is nice.
It sounds more natural.
I alos like her vocals but they are so constrained by lay-overs like in Ex-Factor.
To say that she put so much of her soul into it is a joke!
A real upper, but nothing new or innovative.
I give it 2 and 1/2 stars.
Peechy album, but there is quite a few others I would take to a desert island.
She should only be singing one line at a time.
That's arrogance!
This is one overatted album!
It is no classic and will not be remembered as fondly 10 years from now as it is today.
There is a few good bouncy doo-wop songs, but that's about all this album offers.
Some tracks almost make it.
Very pleasent.
That's no soul.
Most of the time it's just stuff like Superstar where Lauryn bitches about how fly she thinks it is.

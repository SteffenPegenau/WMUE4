Anne Archer: Where is she?
I see and feel boredom all the way through.
Elliott might have made this for some money.
I have yet to see a morepredictable or boring film.
But this is not a movie that he would list on his dossier.
I see a young teen sexy bikini girl who gets hot for a lifeguard, must have him or at least make love.
I see a boring film that is thin.
Some like to see lifeguards rescue stranded people and enjoy photos of sandy beaches, with a few bikinis thrown in.
Ho Hum.
I see a rookie lifeguard trying to fit in withElliott.
This movie is part of the Joan Collins series.
You will enjoy either more.
Sadly it is the opposite of the glamorous image that she portrays.
Why?
Read a book or watch TV.
I see a classmate trying to lure a lifeguard to sell Jaguars and make money.
I have a good copy that will go for $2.00 plus postage.

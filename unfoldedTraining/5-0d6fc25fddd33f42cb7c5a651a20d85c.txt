Their beautiful and they can really move you if you listen.
The songs themeselves tell us so much about the character without saying a word about him.
Be you fan, or music lover, it's a great investment that you won't get tired of.
P.S.
As for the vocal songs, they are just fantastic.
I could be in a quite room listeneing, and suddenly suspence music goes on and I am suddnely on the edge of my seat!
Not tug, more like yank.
Also, it has the ability to pull at your emotions.
I have had the CD for about two years and I never tire of it.
There's another one on the way!
Lori Yates has a beautiful voice and it is just right for the songs that are sung on this soundtrack.
A fan to the end, and beyond, I am able to hear the show in the woderful music of Fred Mollin.
I suggest you check back soon!
The music is great!
I DEFINATELY suggest to anyone who reads this to buy the CD.
It's perfect in it's portrayl of the main character, Nick.

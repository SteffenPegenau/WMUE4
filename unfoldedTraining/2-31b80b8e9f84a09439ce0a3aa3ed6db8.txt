It's really bad 80's pop and it sounds outdated.
But the song overall pretty much gets overplayed way too much, even today.
And I love 80's music!
(its like mj with thriller,it gets old quick!
It would be great to see them do an uptempo song together.
Well, it just plain sucks.
I'm not a really a big fan of this album.
Like a Prayer is ok, the video and concept are great.
I was expecting her duet with Prince to be off the chain(boy was i wrong).
)It's really not that great of a song.
I mean her other 80's stuff is a lot better then this crap.
Other then that I would not waste two cents on this CD.
It's got sort of a rhythm nation feel to it.
The only one that I really like is act of contrition.
Other then that Express yourself(well the album version is really crappy compared to the version i heard on the radio as a kid).
It's very good and creative.

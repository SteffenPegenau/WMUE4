I do not baby my garden implements.
Who knows, but like I said - that's how I treat my garden tools (not overly well).
So, if you baby your tools, skip this review.If you don't baby your tools, then skip these pruners.
They get dirty, they get wet, and I want to just rinse or wipe them up and them put them on the shelf until the next time.
I have to use my hand to open them all the way.
So, I bought these fancy, expensive pruners, and now they are worthless?
Maybe I put them up without drying them off sometime?
That style pruner is what I will stick with from now on!
In the meantime, my good old Corona pruners with the spring that shows still get the job done.
First, let me disclaim.
LIfetime warranty?
How do I file a claim?
The "spring" that opens these pruners doesn't quite spring anymore.
Maybe I attempted to cut too big a branch one day?
No idea.

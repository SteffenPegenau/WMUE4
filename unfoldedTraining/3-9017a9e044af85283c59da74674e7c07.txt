Tight beats but alright flow.
If he was he might still get respect but he lost all of that.
IT don't beat All Eyez on Me, THe Chronic, or DoggyStyle.
Anyway is game the best rapper now?
I didn't see what was great about it.
Being from Long Beach there's alot of hype with game.
He gonna slaughter Game.
It got the West Coast back on the map but it ain't a classic.
Songs like Westside Story, Put you on the Game, How we do, and Hate it or Love It were cool songs.
I got the album when it came out.
NO far from it.
But for the guy that said 50 Cent is a Crip man what you smokin.
Probably but wait for Lil Eazy the True Prince of Compton.
But is this a West Coast Classic.
50 ain't no Crip, he wishes he was.
This is alright from game.

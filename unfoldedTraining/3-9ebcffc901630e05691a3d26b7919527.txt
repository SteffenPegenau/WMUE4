I think I WILL go to the park.
Where is God?Ah- should have stayed home and read this book instead!
WEDNESDAY MORNING'S POINT OF VIEWIn a meeting with the boss, while my rig sits at home reading this book which is about ME!
does this mean I am a frankie?
Who's the hero?
All the rules don't apply.
Sigh!Meanwhile my rig is still reading this book- which i really should get my hands on.
I'm confused, this really shouldn't happen to a dit.
But I am only a dit.Woah, this is getting really strange.
Am I a hero?
Oh dear, someone is trying to kill us.
But thems the breaks, dittos don't complain, there's no time really, when you only live for one day.This meeting is really getting on my nerves, i feel an bearable urge to go to the park.
Who is God?
But only if I can read the whole thing in one day.
Oops, i'm out in the park- oh!
If only life extension for dittos was being developed... but there are ethical reasons for that.Might as well go see some people.

You will gasp and laugh, maybe, as they unravel before your eyes.
Their daughter, caught between these two is equally unhappy.
This is a hot sizzling look at life.
Enter the cheerleader.
High-powered money making agressive realtor Mom (Annette Bening) dominates temporarily, wimpy laid back inept Dad (Kevin Spacey).
Visually perfect.
This film is startling, shocking, graphic.
One moment you're looking at a "perfect american Mom, Dad, Daughter- apple pie in the sky smiling photogenic family" in suburbia, then POW!
Dad starts building those muscles and Mom---- No I won't tell you everything.
It's adult, entertaining, humorous, provocative.
The characters undergo major transformations.
No wonder it won all those awards.
See the film.
Excellent cast.
the action and the "games" begin.
Fantastic script-writing.

Dealing with death badly.
This book is a sympathic view to teenagers making bad decisions and acting badly.But it's well written and interesting.
Underage sex.
I don't think teenagers should be encouraged to read this.
Like older teenagers accepting younger teenagers into their cliches.
Teenagers tend to be very status conscious at this age.
It steers into directions that would never happen in real life too.
And boys don't cry.
Gay lifestyles.
He would be hounded relentessly for displaying these weaknesses.
It has a certain realism that many adults could relate to.
That almost never happens.
So I give it 3 stars.
Reality is much more poignant for teenagers.
Basically everything you don't want a teenager to get confused about.
Giving in to peer pressure.
Experimenting with drugs.

"The Tracy York portion I have used once.
Blanks focuses only on the upper body.
The stretches are uninspiring.
He only does one lower body exercise.
Billy Blanks offers suggestions on how your form should and should not look at exactly the same time when the camera is panning on one of the background exercisers.
The few times I have used the tape - I respond: "Cheated!!!!
A complete waste of time.
While she tries to offer instructions, they are shotty at best.
I ended up relying on her music and routines from my past exercise classes to use instead of hers.
Absolutely the worst video around!
No sweat at all.
Plus, he likes to flex his muscles and say "don't you want to look like this"?
He gives little or no direction and periodically he likes to ask - how do you feel?
The background hooping and hollering is annoying, not to mention distracting.
Where to begin...the tape is slow moving, boring and completely uninspiring.
But then, I am no fan of Crunch or of Billy Blanks

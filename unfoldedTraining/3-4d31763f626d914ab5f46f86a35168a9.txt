I agree with all reviewers about stale ideas, etc... Why didn't Berman ever take the next logical step???
First off, I've got to say I'm a huge Star Trek fan.
Why didn't the Borg make it earth, ala the Wolf 357 tv episode???
However, this is probably the first ST movie I've ever really been disappointed with.
I've loved STNG especially.
If not, I guess there will always be the hope of a Star Gate SG-1 movie!!
I just hope they get some new ideas and make better movies.
Same goes here.
!
I know some people will say they did that in First Contact, but that's NOT the same thing, nor is it what First Contact was all about.
I mean, ok... there was 5 with the god thing and everything, but...
Or, if Deep Space 9 was along the same time line, why didn't the Dominion make it to earth???
I've never thought they threw up an airbal until this one.
Its like the idiots with the Alien franchise.
Why didn't the Aliens ever make it to earth???

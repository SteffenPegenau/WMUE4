No.
Effort.
what the F?
a lot of shock value humor, and he isnt even trying in the 2nd season.
and as far as the 2nd season is concerned, he puts no effort into it.
who has a BEST OF episode in their first season?
this show will die by season 4. i win.
Game.
i feel that since everyone is giving him 5 stars cuz they love the show, that someone needs to speak the obvious and say this show is the same repetitive lack of trying skits.
am i the only one who realizes that this comedian puts no effort into his show?
by the end, he'll have a best of season 2 episode that includes 4 charlie murphy skits and 3 lil' jon crap skits.
Funny, but no where near great.
All.
Blouses.

One moment is when .
I can not say ANY of them.
Everything else is good except the script.
They are all obscene.
One movie that presented difficult situations excellently is Black Snake Moan.

I have a feeling the film's writers wanted these bold scenes to be cathartic and freeing.
She did not ruin the movie; the script did it for her.
I have never before seen a movie like this.

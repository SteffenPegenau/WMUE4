Pinobee is a cute little bee with attitude.
At first I also thought it was easy but if you really want to beat the game it takes awhile and there's plenty to do.
Now I have played it all twice and this time I made it to other levels that wasn't there the first time.
At first I thought the game was no big deal but when I had finished it the first time I realized that that was only one of the endings.
This game is great as you can play it all over again and get a different story.
If you like Rayman you'll like Pinobee too!
And yet there are more endings to it.
The more you play the more you get into it and you'll realize that you can play this game for a long time.
So it is not just for kids (actually, it might be too difficult for some), I'm 28 and I'm having a great time with it.
How many there are I don't know yet.
He's fun to play and easy to move around.
So check it out, it is worth it.
There are more!
Fantastic!!!
And the graphics...

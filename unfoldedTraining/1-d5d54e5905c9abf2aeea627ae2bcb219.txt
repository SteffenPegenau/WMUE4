Don't buy this.
Falling on you back, and, well, your back in a different way.
Grinding will lead to such rages that you have never imagened.
When at home, get on your skateboard or any thing else that rolls, and go full speed at a wall.
The only thing good is the music.
Unless you are in this game.
The physics in this game are outrageous.
Not evan the best skaters could sustain such a hit.
Try this.
This is a bad thing.
In this game however, you just stop.
Also, when you do fall(and when attemting tricks you will do a lot of)you only have two bail animations.
Oh, and don't evan think about doing any other tricks, not that there are many to try.
No clue as to when you are going to fall off.
Do you know what happens?
You fall down.

Brought back a lot of memories both good and bad.
It was also very short.
I can't remember if Brian interviewed me or not.
Anyway back to the film.
I know because I was there.
Well it wasn't a ground breaking film and I was a little confused on where Brian Palmer was going with this.
Funny how I stumble across this.
A true warrior and honorable Marine.
I may have saw myself in the background once or twice.
It did have some graphic things in it but so do most of the videos on Youtube.
Semper Fi.
Like I said, could have been done better but was still an interesting watch.
C'mon Brian, I know you had tons more footage.
I'm glad I had the opportunity to serve with him along with all the other Marines that were there with me.
It was interesting to watch my unit in action.
So the title doesn't give it justice.
SSGT Marino is the man.
I do remember I thought he was working for MTV.

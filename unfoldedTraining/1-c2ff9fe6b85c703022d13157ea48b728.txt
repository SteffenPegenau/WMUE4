But writing well and living well are entirely different.
For those who want to understand what is was like to be a soldier in Vietnam, read "We Were Soldiers Once... and Young" or "Steel My Soldiers' Hearts".
He started complaining about Vietnam before he arrived.
Every page is filled with criticism, cynicism, griping, complaining, and self-serving tripe.
Caputo wasn't much of a marine.
We served.
Many of us who served in Vietnam believed there were many things that made no sense.
He wanted to be a hero, but he didn't have what it took to be anything but a whining wimp.
Sure the rules of engagement were stupid, but a soldier serves.
But we didn't turn tail and run.
Certainly he writes well.
Sure the war was politicized, but so is every war.
He doesn't understand honor or duty.
Caputo did not serve; rather he whined.
If you want to know what is was like to be useless in Vietnam, read this book.

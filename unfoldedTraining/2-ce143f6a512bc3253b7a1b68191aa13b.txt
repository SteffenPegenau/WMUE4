Youll probably love it.
Thing is, its a shame to say, but its party rap.
This tries to combine both....once again......no thankyou.
It really is.
I dont see the point of this CD.
Its better rap than your P Diddy's and Mase's but.....nothanks.
NOT J5, but nearly at the very bottom standard of it.
Try out Lewis Parker or Deltron 3030.
Yeah, they can breakdance.
You either go out and buy hip hop, or you buy a remix of a dance song.
Get J5, or Illmatic by Nas.
Its like, there are things within it are could almost be J5.
Its not even good party rap.
Thats pretty cool, but its not worth a CD, just a handshake.
I have more respect for BEP than a lot of other groups around.
If youre thinking about getting this....eheh, dont.
If you DONT care about borderline RNB/HIP HOP, then get it.

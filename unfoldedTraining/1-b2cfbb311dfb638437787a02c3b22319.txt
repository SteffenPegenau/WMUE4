The tv auto shutsoff in 10 minutes.
I called every 3 days and they told me that it's 'in transit'.
It will be my last Phillips Television.
Stay away from Phillips Television if I were you!
Go figures.
The Phillips 27PT643R is the worst television ever based on over 10 televisions I have brought in the past decade.
First Phillips Television.
Just today when I call in, the customer service rep told me that the parts is in back order.
It's over 3 weeks and the television have not been repaired.
Since I got my Television on November 29, 2003, half of the time is in the shop.
This television craped out on me in a 2 1/2 months prior to the factory warranty expiration of 90 Days.
Took 10 days to schedule an appointment with a Phillips Technician.
As of now, I still have not gotten my television back.
It's not in transit.
When onsite, Phillips Technician was unable to repair it.
So he brought it back to the Factory Store.

Earphones are nice, but hurt your ears after a while.
Comes with belt clip.
Doesn't skip.
Really easy for people who haven't ever used one before.
The Back lite screen makes it easy to see in the dark.
Hey hows it goin??
The sound is great.
Software is very nice.
Also comes with batteries.
Battery life is ok, could be better.
Good little player for those who are new to mp3 players.
Has a lock on the buttons so don't worry about switching tracks while its in your pocket.
Very small and durable.
Well i got this player for christmas and i am very impressed.
Buttons are easy to press.

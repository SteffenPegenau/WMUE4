I've looked everywhere for a canopy for this product to keep the cats off it but can't find one.
However, the canopy does not stay on very well.
I do like all of its features (music, vibration, nature sounds, etc).
It is an adorable item.
I use it every day.
I received this as a gift for my baby.
You'd think they could make a better canopy for how much this cost.
I opted not to take this with me while traveling.
But on the upside, it is great to wheel around the house when you need to roam from room-to-room.
When my baby is old enough, I am sure he will enjoy it more.
Though it does pack up nicely, it is still a bit on the heavy side for me.
My baby is three months now and enjoys the sheeps dangling from the canopy.
It seems to be constantly popping up even though I snap it down.
Any ideas where I can find it??
?

STOP PUTTING SKITS ON RECORDS.
I'm so very sorry but i really liked his first two albums.
NOBODY LIKES IT
And last but defenitly not least JA-Fool and Nelly.
Dmx,Snoop,Drag-on,Slim,Game,50,Dre MAKE GREAT LP's not just 1 great song every once in a while.
I'm trying to give al these rappers a wake up call.
Why is it so hard to make an album whit 20 great songs on it?
If i'm gonna spend money make it worth my wild.
I've got a question for al rappers out there.
Darkman X.
Both of you please stop what your doing.
All ya rappers know who i'm talking bout.
Sh*t man even dr. Dre is more renewing then Russel Simmons and that guy is what 50 years old.
Stop wasting my time whit f*cked up albums whit only 3 great songs on it.
Nowadays all i hear is the same ol sh*t. Is there anybody outthere who can tell me what is the use of all those stupid skits.
Please stop putting your sh*t out there.

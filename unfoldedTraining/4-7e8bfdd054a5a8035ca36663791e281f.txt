I like their dance moves.
I also like the song "Someday".
Maybe she'll have it by SUMMERTIME'My friend & I LOVE the song This Madness.
They sing the song "Footloose" (I love that song, too) & it will get you pumped up.
But for right now, Carolyne needs to work more on her back tuck.
Pure NRG is great!
Pure NRG might be for you.
I like "Pray" & "Live my life for you".
I bet later on, they'll all be doing full tucks.
I want people to listen to the band, then see if they like it or not.
They may be young, but they are fun.
So far so good!
Anybody that likes a lot of excitement will like Pure NRG!
People always try to find some type of music that they like.
Jordan Ryan Yates, Caroline Grace Elizabeth Williams, & Laura Carolyne Joyce Myers all have great singing voices.

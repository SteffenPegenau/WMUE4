i'm surprised this album never got attention, little long their last album.
but, it will grow on you.
i bought this cd for 5 bones used.
its a real big step compared to their last cd.
then one day i tried to give it another chance.
try it out.......
the first spin of this album was not a good spin, after experiencing their last album.
so after the first spin i let it sit in its case for awhile.
the songs have the heavy distorted guitars like the last album, but more than that.
i still really couldn't grasp it, so i kept trying.
the vocals are diffferent, at first kind of annoying.
eventually, it grew on me.
i read the review here before buying also.
just give it a few spins.
there is so many elements in this cd.

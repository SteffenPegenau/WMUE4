Hello Amazon, The Wonder Washer is a miracle for people who don't have room for a regular size washer.
!
Even though the lid sometimes may come off while in the washing cycle, but it hardly ever happens.
Or for that matter if you don't have the necessary plumbing as well.
Maybe a locking mechanism isn't a bad idea.
I still would buy the Wonder Washer again if these changes were made.
The washer sometimes spins loosely on the base unit.
Maybe a heavier lid is needed.
The knobs on the washer could be redesigned so turning them would be a little easier.
It is necessary that rubber matting is shown on the video.
On the underside of the base unit there are holes that water drips through.
On the video of how the device works doesn't show that you should put a rubber matting under the washer.
Thank you Wonder Washer!!
It is really nice not having to go out in the cold or hot or rainy weather to do ones laundry.
The lid should fit better.

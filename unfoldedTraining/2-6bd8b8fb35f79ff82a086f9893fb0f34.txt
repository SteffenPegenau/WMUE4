This movie is nothing like "Silence of the Lambs".
But this went beyond it and seemed to have no point.
He's different, less interesting and original, more like a common criminal.
Too bad, "Silence" could have had such a good sequel.
I like horror movies, I've watched many films both physically and psychologically disturbing.
So, we're down to three stars.
Thus, I end up with a 2-point rating.
It's sickening and disturbing.
It's also gratuitous.
I can't emphasize it enough.
First of all, don't expect a good sequel.
This movie is average in the thriller-like category respect.
As a matter of fact, everything about it is average, which might have gotten it 4 stars.
However, the character of Hannibal is not the same person we met in the first movie.
The original was a very suspenseful psychological thriller, the duration of which you spent on the edge of your seat.
However, the ending is Horrible.

The black light bleed is very bad.
The picture was terrible.
I bought a new card XFX geforce 7600 gs, for another $150.00.
When I tried to play a movie, DVD DISC, MPEG, AVI, ANYTHING.
Amazon was great about refunding shipping.
If you watch films on your monitor, you can't help but notice it.PS.
Same quality on films.
Very bad pixilation.
I hooked my old 15 inch monitor back up, the picture quality for movies is great.
I tried latest driver from XFX, from nvidia, etc.
I was told it might be the video card.
Changed screen resolutions, everything you could think of, I tried.
I have returned this monitor, now I have to wait for a refund before I will try a different monitor.
The picture for viewing movies was terrible.
Viewing the internet this monitor was great.
Amazon is the best online store there is.

Next day 9:00 am it was at half-charge.
I always felt my ear wasnt THAT trained to be fazed by some noise.
- never used it for the 12 hrs.
!
I know better now.
still went down.The "DVR100" module:Remote stopped working on the 31st day.
(just kidding - it actually worked for 2 months - and then stopped)very satisfied with the video quality for my recording, just as the product review says.audio quality of recording - poor.
In brief:Dont like it.
dont recommend it.
too much static noise.Audio quality overallHorrible.
otherwise go in for a piece with less features (if need be) but do not compromise on the audio quality!!
dont want it anymore.At length:Battery life:Set to charge at 7:00am.
unplugged at 9:00pm.
After using my CD player, I cant hear the same song on this system!!
!Advice to potential buyers:Please check the system to see if you are ok with the reduction in quality.

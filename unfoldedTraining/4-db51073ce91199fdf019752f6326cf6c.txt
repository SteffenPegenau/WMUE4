Bad DVD's just happen.
A real popcorn and soda pop and chocolate Saturday afternoon Western.
Saddle up your Orville Ridenbacher or Paul Newman "Real Movie Popcorn", shut down your brain for a little while and relax.
My particular disc came with flaws.
I think I'll buy the sound track.
The music is great.
No problem.
The actors, including Kevin Costner, don't get in the way too much.
It's always a pleasure doing business with Amazon.The movie Silverado is FUN.
They even informed me when they received the returned disc and assured me that I wouldn't be charged for the replacement.
I reported this to Amazon and they replaced my disc with a smile.
I couldn't get rid of the French subtitles and the last fifteen minutes of sound was bad.
The scenery is terrific.
It's fun.
Maybe I'll visit New Mexico or Big Bend this year.
Doesn't have a nodding acquaintance with fact or reality.
A word about DVD production.

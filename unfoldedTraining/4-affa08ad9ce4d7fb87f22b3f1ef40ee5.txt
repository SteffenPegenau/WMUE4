I was totally confused for the first several pages.
I did not like the beginning.
David Nash is great as a defense attorney.
Where were about five different stores going at one time.
I gave it four stars for a couple of reasons.

No one could follow that bunch of numbers.
What a book.
It was very, very good.
His morals leave a lot to be desired, but he is a good attorney until he meets his match in Tom Gault.
I did not want to put it down after it really got started.
I really liked the book except for those two things.
It will keep you reading fast in order to see what is going to happen.
If you like legal thrillers you must read this.

i would still rather play any of the games mentioned before.
we were lead to believe that all of your actions were going to effect your good or evil.
nothing to offer in a game new.
someday someone will be able to copy the freeform world and sheer number of quests of morrowwind, the story of kotor, the graphics of kingdom hearts, and make a rpg that is truly worthwhile.
its not.
beautiful graphics?
play knights of the old republic.
you want to see true free form, play morrowind.
hardly earth shattering.
we were led to be it was free form.
okay graphics.
this is the most disappointing game i have ever played.
it does, but it is very poorly done.you want to see it done right?
my copy was traded in for x-men legends.
that would of been kingdom hearts when it came out what, 4 years ago.
no major advancements here.

You will become addicted!
Once you start it's impossible to get them off your mind.
I didn't want to play this dumb little girl game!
I promise you these games will become a part of you.
Most people think this game is just for preteen girls.
!
But, that's not true.
It doesn't matter if you're male, I didn't think I'd like it either.
Believe me, it will be worth your time!!!!!!
But I played it, and now I can't stop!
Men!
You've already heard about how great this game is from other reveiewers, so I don't need to say much.
It's for you too!
You have to try this game!
I'd like to say one thing though.
Curse of Blackmoor Manor is no exception.
From children to elderly, including men!
Curse of Blackmoor Manor, along with all the other Nancy Drew Games are games that are for all ages.
I am a male, one of my friends had me try one, and I have become a huge fan!

Ian, why did you make this album for an audience of one?
I do like the anti-tax rhetoric, though.
Rant but just don't curse me mum!
Please stick to subjects that other 'morons' can relate to AND ENOUGH AIRING OUT YOUR DIRTY LAUNDRY!!!!
See ya in October!
Reclaim your throne and save us all from another Aerosmith commercial or Kiss farewell tour!
I'll be the LOUDEST one again!
Yourself!
I don't think so!
Don't get enough of that from the artists!
You Love England, You Hate England.
Still got Overend's beeper number?
"Go tell the Superstar that all his hairs are turning gray!"
I'll listen any damn thing you put out!
Rant into a dictaphone instead!
Chained to this stake?
Love Ya!
Try the Bahamas!

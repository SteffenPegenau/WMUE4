I no longer have to take the pain meds.
I no longer have weeks that I have to walk crooked with back spasms.
I was diagnosed with a herniated disc.
I got the DVD and it worked.
I feel better.
The program relaxs, strengthens, and stretches.
I would recommend this tape to anyone with back problems.
I have flexibility I never did before.Mimi is a great instructor.
For the cost of one co-payment at physical therapy, I can now just put on the DVD and get results I never got at physical therapy.
I was sent to physical therapy and pain medications.
As a result of following the program my back pain is relieved.
My wife suggested I get Mimi's DVD.
When I started the exercise program on the DVD, I still had back pain, but the exercises were gentle enough that I could still make it through all 30 minutes.
I hope this doesn't sound like an informercial.
I am so glad I did.
My back pain was still there.

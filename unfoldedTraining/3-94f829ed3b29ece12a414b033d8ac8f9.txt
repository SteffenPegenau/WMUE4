These tapes are awesome.
I do like the new firm tapes.
Allie is a great instructor.
Now these new tapes arent like the old firm videos.
They are truely the best on the market.
I get a nice workout.
But if you want something more exciting and different you might want to get the older firm tapes.
My favorite is Cardio Sculpt.
The older firm tapes had different music, which made them stand out even more.All in all, these tapes are fun and challenging.
Ab sculpt is the tape i use the most and I dont think its worth more than 10 dollars.
The music isnt that motivating either.
I own about 30 excersize videos and they all have the same songs on them.
Though I do like Lisa Kay, this workout is just boring.
And the instructors dont face the crowd like the old ones.
The background is really really boring and so are their costumes.

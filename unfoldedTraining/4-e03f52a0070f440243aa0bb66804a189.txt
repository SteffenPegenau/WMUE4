if you are a beginner i recomend a beginner pack just like this.
but the cables and guitar straps that came with it sucked.
about 5 monthes after i bought it the thing that attached to the guitar strap kept coming off.
if you want cooler picks than the ones on amazon.com i recomend going to hotpicksusa.com.
it is a really great guitar and can play any kind of music.
i have a rat fink "surf all day" guitar strap.
at a local guitar store i bought a planet rock guitar like this.
rick guitars way better than that one.
but i like b.c.
but you can at least buy a guitar here to make mr. amazon happy.
so i super-glued it and it works fine.
so do it!
take it fom me an innocent child buy it if you think it is the right thing to buy.
for this guitar i recomend a levys leathers guitar strap.
so i bought some more and they worked perfectly.
for this guitar green cable look good with it.

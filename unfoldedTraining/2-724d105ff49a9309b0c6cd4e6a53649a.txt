No examples.
What does that mean?
It was just babble.
I wouldn't even suggest this book for general fitness.
No routines.
I finally got a copy and I am disappointed.
No technique explanation.
Many people in the strength community gave it praise.
The only redeeming value is he introduces odd-object lifting i.e atlas stones, kegs, huge rocks which is actually helpful and functional, but he doesn't explain why it works or how to make your own.
LIFT HARD, LIFT HARD, LIFT HARD!
It is all just RANT, RANT, RANT, I stopped reading it.
No anatomy or bio-physics explained.
I was hoping this book would help me transition from powerlifting to strongman competitions, but I will look somewhere else.
It was hard to find do to it being out of print.
I've heard about this book for many years.
This book is like MEIN KAMPF for weightlifters.
It was like a motivational speaker with a 6th grade education.
I would suggest 'Power to the People' if you want to get strong.

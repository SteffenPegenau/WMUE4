I read the instructions and thought perhaps I had a dirty gasket.
I do not try to make too much, nor do I try to make more after frothing.
I had similar trouble with the ESE pods.
The automatic milk frother was wonderful!
Wish I had read the reviews...
I was so excited to get my Krups Novo 2300 Plus.
I cleaned everything and was unable to get it to stop leaking.
Great crema on the espresso and nice flavor.
It took a bit of time to get used to the settings, but once I had it figured out it worked great.
I guess frothed milk sans coffee could be OK...Just kidding.
As I continued to use the machine on other occasions, I began to experience the dreaded LEAKS.
It just leaks.
I am trying to decide what to do next.
No.
Now it leaks on every cup.
I had tried two other brands and was disappointed.
When I used the machine the first few times, it was wonderful.

I wanted to wear some heels since my new job and thought who better than Dansko?
I LOVE Dansko.
In fact, some shoes are too wide for me.
Well, I loved the look of the Remy the best and bought a pair at my friends shop.
Unfortuneatly, I do not wear them for more than an a couple of hours at a time.
I didn't even know your toes could get cramped.
They are my favorite shoe.
Other than that the arch is fine.
The only problem with this shoe is that my toes literally get cramped.
And I don't have wide feet.
But I couldn't get past the cramped toes.
I don't wear anything else to work (since I am on my feet ALL day).
When I got them, I wore them around a little on my day off.
Especially if they have been tried on too many times and have been stretched out or broken in.
If it weren't for that, they would be the perfect heel!

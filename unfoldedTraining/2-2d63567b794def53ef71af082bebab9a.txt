I feel that I fell for the hype when I preordered this with overnight shipping.
She started out as a radical liberal and is moving to the center for political reasons.
I got this through overnight shipping, hoping that the hype matched the book.
Her respect for the truth is shaky.
She looks the other way when it comes to Bill's adultery.
She likes power.
And that is the gist of the book.
No bombshells.
No new revelations.
What this actually is is a tepid rehash of other Hillary books.
I think I wasted my money.
Nothing new here.
She has had rumors dog her that she may be gay.
She wants to be president.
Since I already thought that Hillary was a values empty yuppie who lusted to be president at any cost, this book did not offer me anything new.

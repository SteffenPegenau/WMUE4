The Sheryl Crow song is nice, and on her debut also.
Therapy is ok, and Soup Dragons add a song I never heard.
No reviews in 18 years?
I always liked this film.
East 17 is hip-hop or R&B, kinda odd choice.
Nice and dark.
Good pop-punk.
They only ever released one 1993 album "Indianism".
This soundtrack had more potential.
Love the X song.
The Indians have two songs here.
Quicksand is a good fit.
They have a heavy sound like Helmet or Kyuss, and the song here is also on their great debut "Slip".
A bit of dialogue from the film would have been sweet.
It seems whoever put this soundtrack together purposely choose unknown bands, to most people anyway.
Wild At Heart and True Romance had better songs, but this is decent.
Very Soup Dragonsy though.
Cool early role for Brad Pitt.

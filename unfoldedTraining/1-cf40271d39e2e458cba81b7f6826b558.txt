Duh, how do you find out a product doesn't work if you don't try it?
And I still need a new vacuum cleaner.
Lots of noise, no suction.
So I packed it up in the box and went back to Target.
I now have $100 worth of plastic in a box in my basement.
Sounds simple.
Total time: 5 minutes, tops.
You'll get more enjoyment if you just burn $100.
Switched attachments and headed for my carpeted stairs, same problem.
It doesn't suck!
It doesn't suck!
THEY WOULDN'T TAKE IT BACK SINCE I OPENED THE BOX!
I took it out of the box, plugged it in, aimed it at my hardwood floor.
Call a psychic??
All I want is a vacuum cleaner that uses a vacuum to suck dirt up to make my place clean.

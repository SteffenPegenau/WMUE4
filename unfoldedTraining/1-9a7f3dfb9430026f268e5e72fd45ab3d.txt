I can never understand what all the hype was about.
Within 10 minutes, I was bored out of my mind and ready to sneak into another movie.
I've seen Clueless and Bring It On ATLEAST 10 times each, so you know I know my fluff.
This movie was just a disgrace.
It was BOUND to get better right???
Blah, blah, blah.
Maybe at the Nail (or hair) salon, but it was a FORCED chuckle.
But, I stuck it out.
Goes after boy.
A blonde girl gets dump by boy.
Finds out boy isn't worth it.
Just because Reese is adorable doesn't mean the movie is.P.S.
Throughout the whole movie, I didn't "laugh-out-loud" for one moment.
The plot was completly predictable and unfunny.
Finds a better boy and gains self-confidence.
There wasn't even a chuckle.
I was really excited about going to watch Legally Blonde the first time.
WRONG!

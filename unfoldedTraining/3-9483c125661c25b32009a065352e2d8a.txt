I then pressed it really hard and it turned on.
He loves buses.
However it doesn't look like a button.
He'll keep pressing the "On" window over and over, and because his fingers are small and doesn't hit the exact location of the button, it doesn't turn on.
The buttons on the side and top also have to be pressed with a little force in order for it to speak or make the sounds.
However it is difficult to press the buttons.
My son sometimes has trouble with it.
I just wish it was a little easier for small children to operate.
When it does work my son loves it.
There is an "On" sticker in one of the windows of the bus.
He'll then bring it to me to do.
It took me a while to figure out how to turn it on.
I pressed it several times and it didn't do anything, so I assumed it was just a decal.
He likes the music and the flashing lights on this bus.
I got this toy for my 26-month-old son for Christmas.

We women are more independent now than we've ever been.
Now, I'm beginning to wonder.
Create the life you want, than find a man to share it with.
Move on.
We're approaching the new Millennium.
I always believed that the Brits matured much sooner than we Americans.
Find it within yourself.
I wanted to say to Bridget, get over it.
For months I was anticipating sitting down with this book, and once I did, I have to admit I was a bit disappointed.
Especially, because it would be demeaning to finally find a man to take care of you for the rest of your life.
I'm now 34, and couldn't find a single issue of hers relevant to my own life now.
Don't depend on a man for happiness.
You're in your 30s; take responsibility for your own life.
Yes, it is very funny, yet I find Bridget's obsessions to be something I experienced during my teen-age years and early 20s.
Otherwise you'd still be miserable.
Only depressing and unenlightening.
I just couldn't find this book funny.

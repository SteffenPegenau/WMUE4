Now this one only 6 months.
Exactly what I wanted & correct size.
But that's what I do.
It is a tad loud, but it heats the water fast & it sure gets hot - - perfect for tea.
The American brand died after a year.
Problem is - after six (6) months it's just died.
Now I guess it's still under warranty.
Problem is - I have to find the paperwork & I have too much to do to deal with that.
I had none of the reported odor issues.
So - would I recommend this one - No.
I've had Krups & something else before.
Bad trend as far as I'm concerned.
The Krups lasted for about 18 months.
I can not do that, six months is not long enough lifespan for this item at this price.
OK I realize these may not be made for a three to four times per day use.
I have loved it until it just died.

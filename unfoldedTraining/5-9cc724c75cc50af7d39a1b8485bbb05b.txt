I spent exactly two weeks in still another outfit, was formally assigned to it, and can tell you almost nothing about it.
Consequently, I dont get invited to their reunions.
My criteria for any book is simple.
The information in this book is consistent with my experiences and the experiences depicted in similar books about Vietnam.
The story must be plausible.
They were volunteered for temporary duty elsewhere, and there is no formal record of it.
The writing must be excellent.
I cant argue if Roberts wuz or wuznt in the Walking Dead Battalion.
I do know that me and my friends from Vietnam argue about events we experienced together.
I dont know.
This book satisfies my requirements and gets 5 stars.I was in the military and served in Vietnam.
I served several weeks with one outfit in Vietnam, but was never formally assigned to that unit.
Some of my friends had similar experiences.
So the issue of "assignment" is irrelevant to me.
And the subject has to be absorbing.

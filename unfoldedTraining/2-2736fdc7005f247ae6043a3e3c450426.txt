But wanted to splurge so i order these MDR90.
These MDR90's sound way muffled campared to the 71's.
Bigger driver blaw blaw blaw.
Iv been pulling my hair out trying to figure out why my 71's sound so much better.
My brand new MDR 90's are just ornaments now.
I dont get it.
What are you thinking.
Go with the 71's 0r 80's.
All you five star people!!
I hate getting riped off.
This is the only review all you need to read.
Buy the EX71 or 81.
All that tech jargon is worthless TRUST ME!!
It seems like none of these reviewers have actually tried both models (71's vs 90's) I have!!!!!!
No No No I dont care what any of you say.
I have been using the EX71s for a year or so now.
with the same player ,same song.
Its plane and simple.
Thes DO NOT sound as good as the EX71 buds.

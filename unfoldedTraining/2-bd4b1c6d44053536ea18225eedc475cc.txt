Sorry my friends, you have failed.
They make too much noise which is very boring after some few of their attacks.
When I heard that a mutated band from Japan who is even dressing a bit Devo-ish has come up, I was pleased and very curious.
His screams are hidden behind the noise wall of the musicians.
.
The Polysics, compared to Devo, are awful and terribly bad.
But that noise made sense, it made people go mad on the dancefloor.
And they know how to keep the inheritance of Devo properly!
And then forget about the singer.
The Polysics from Japan refer to Devo when it comes to describe main influences .
It's not Punk, it's not New Wave, it's not Devo.
well, compared to the japanese people even the wonderful Devo where more sort of a pop band.
He cannot sing at all, maybe that's why you can barely hear him at all.
That's a great band.
I mean, they also made some kind of unusual noise, as we all know.
.
Now i must say, that Devo fans better listen to The Network.

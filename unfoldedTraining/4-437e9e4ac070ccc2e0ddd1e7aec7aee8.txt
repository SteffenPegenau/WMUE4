These are plastic card cases.
Do not let your expectations run wild.
Probably not.
Yes.
You could put an SD card in them, but I don't think they were especially designed for such use.
Will they hold a standard CF card and give it a minimal, basic level of protection from the other stuff in your bag?
They do that very thing.They arrived on time, in good shape, and none have broken yet.
Are they sand-storm-proof?
Probably not.
They do not even contain memory cards.
Are they crush-proof?
Are they proof against extremes of heat and cold?
Probably not.
I am content.NOTE: I am using these for CF cards, not SD cards.
Probably not.
They are not filled with magic, or the secrets of the universe.
These are just the cases.Are they waterproof?

I don't know if the regular packaged CD is colored the same, but you should be able to read the tracks.I bought this mostly for its lower price.
Where's the "eco-friendly"?
Loved it.The packaging is a huge disappointment.
I have no issues with the music.
The yellow CD has the songs listed in a background gold.
The depression the CD sits in is styrofoam.
Ha!
I transferred the CD to a "genuine plastic" cover.
I really enjoyed listening to the hits from 1964-1981 in the order they were released.
The sides are open.
Won't make that mistake again.
The cover has a huge "1" punched through it.
Ha!
The CD is exposed to dust if you leave it in this packaging.
You can only read it when you tilt the CD so the light reflects just right.
Usually albums are not arranged that way.

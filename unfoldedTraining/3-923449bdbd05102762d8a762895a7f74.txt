He does sound alot like Sammy.
Remember 5150 CD.Im a die hard Van Halen Fan and I will give them a chance.
Im not sure about VHIII.
Best song is FIRE IN THE HOLE.
We all have bad days.
And this album not bad.
I hope Ed and Gary get better with time.
Its like they recorded a album and just needed a body in the group for lead singer.
You can hardly understand Gary.
I not sure if this is on purpose or not.
I didn't like the album the first time I listened to it.
Its just not thier greatest work.
Maybe the next album will be better after they have a chance to work with Gary.
It does ROCK.
I wish you could bring back the past and David Lee Roth back in the group but you can't.
Van Halen fans don't give up.
But I like it a little bit more each time I listen to it.

But I certainly expect more from such an expert.
Nice try, Mr. Fremer.
In addition to being a well respected audio equipment reviewer, Fremer is, no doubt, an expert in the vinyl field.
But you can do better.....
From the perspective of providing info on vinyl, it did a reasonable job.
It seems to me that Mr. Fremer was terribly bored by having to set up all these tables.
Well, I "guess" I could.
Did I learn something I don't know before?
Can I set up a VPI Scout all by myself?
But the details are exactly what the newbies need.
As a "how-to" guide, it skips some glory details -- several sections were cut short.
Unfortunately, the video is a bit disappointing.
Yes, it is only video I know of.
Would I recommend it to someone who wants to set up his/her own table?
It certainly makes perfect sense to learn turntable set-up from the very best.
Absolutely.

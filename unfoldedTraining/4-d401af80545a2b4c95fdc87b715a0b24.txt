My problem with the velvet rope was that it followed the same formula as janet.
It's a good cd, somewhere between 93's Janet and 97's velvet rope.
Peace.
Got till it's gone = That's the way love goes, I get so lonely = anytime anyplace and so on.
Got it?
I don't really care for the first song, i don't know why, maybe it will grow on me, but it gets better from there.
If you are a janet fan, you are going to like it.
It's janet.
Anyway.
so when it comes out on the 24th, go buy it.
Not so with this album.
Writing this on April 20th.
I think their using some knew production techniques cause the cd gives my stereo a sound I didn't know it possessed.
I like every track from 3 to 11.
I got the Janet cd early because a store in my neighborhood started selling it early.
Almost every song on the VR had a similar song on janet.
It goes it's own route and comes off nicely.
I haven't really listened to the rest of it yet cause I want to take my time and enjoy it.
Good.

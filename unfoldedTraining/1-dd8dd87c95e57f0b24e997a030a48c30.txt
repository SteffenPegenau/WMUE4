i dont mean to go against all swiss army knives or anything but a couple of years ago i got a Victorinox knife and it was the biggest piece of crap i had ever owned.
it was being held together by extremely weak glue.
I will never buy one again.
If the blade wobbles, tighten it.
so much better it was absurd.
But the way Victorinox makes it's knives...
I got a wenger later on and it worked PERFECTLY.
it was like 8 bucks i got at walmart.
I got a gerber Winchester knife and it lasted me for three years.
a victorinox costs like at least 20 and lasts 1 day???
Literally 1 hour after i opened it, WITHOUT using it, the crappy plastic outer shell came off.
like i said... go with a solid steel real folding knife, NOT SWISS, and make sure that it has a steel handle.
If you want a great reccomendation, go with a solid steel gerber knife.
Its that simple.
i think not.

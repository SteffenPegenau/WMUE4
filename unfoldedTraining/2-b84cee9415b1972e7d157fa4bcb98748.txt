There are SO many other fitness DVD's out there that are better than this.
What a WASTE of $30.
She gives you little to no tips on form, no motivation, nothing!
GREAT!
I am so angry that I bought this!!!
Good luck trying to copy her moves in your living room.
I would have given it only 1 star, but I'm sure there are women out there who having dance backgrounds and they might think this is a good DVD.
This is seriously the worst workout DVD ever made.
You just hear the music and see her dancing around.
If I could break it down for you: Tracy Anderson dances around in a basement fitness room (looking totally, utterly bored and trying very hard to look sexy & sultry).
Then, Tracy tells you how she came up with all of this nonsensical garbage.
That will help me look so much better in a bathing suit!UGH!
Terrible.
I kept waiting for her workout to get better and it just didn't.
Seriously, don't buy.
To top it off, Gwyneth Paltrow speaks at the end, and talks about whoknowswhat.

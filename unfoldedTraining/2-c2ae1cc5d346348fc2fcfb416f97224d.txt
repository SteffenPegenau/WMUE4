Number of sex scenes: two.
The characters did not interest me as much as I would have liked.
She and the police chief Knox work together and fall for each other.
It wasn't that interesting for me.
Setting: 1985 and 2005 small town in Kentucky.
Genre: time travel mystery story with a little suspense and a little romance.
Nikita is an FBI agent from 2200 who travels to 2005 to stop them, but doesn't know what they are looking for.
Knox says she might "split".
Sexual language: moderate.
For example, instead of calling someone a "big baby" she calls him a "large baby."
The author toys with Nikita's lack of understanding of slang.
I much prefer Ms. Howard's other books.
She doesn't know that means "leave."
There was not much in the way of romantic or emotional development.
Some people are murdered.

Story brief: Bad guys from around 2200 time travel back to 2005 to get something of value.

Coelacanth is frustrating to listen to.
Thankfully, the original group got back together, maybe a little too late to save.
The album is not good nor bad, but at least interesting.
The new direction changed the sound of the group.
Just no album.
Let us be glad the album was not released in 1987.
Wayne Famous's various keyboard styles are extensive, maybe overly done to cover very weak musical material.
However, for most Producers fans, The Producers just wasn't the same after the departure of Kyle Henderson.
There is a lot of controversy where Coelecanth is concerned.
Tim Smith is credited with giving the group another direction.
You hear the familiar hooks, but then it goes into completely somewhere else.
Certainly, it would be disappointing to say the least.
For Producers fans, Coelacanth was one of those mysterious albums.
This certainly changed the formula that made the Producers such a awesome group.
We all heard the tunes.

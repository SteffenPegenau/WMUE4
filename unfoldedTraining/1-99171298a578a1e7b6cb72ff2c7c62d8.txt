I think she is a light coloratura, and should stay with singing Fledermous's maid.
But otherwise, her voice is just too shrill.Why do you think she's call Beverly Shrill?
Her voice is too thin and has too much air and cutting edge.
Her "Baby Doe" is superb.
She is only good before she was famous.
Her high notes are pathetic.
Sill's voice is way past it's prime.
The operas are boring.
It is terrible.
Sorry, that's my opinion.
It's too long.
The sound is not bad though.
I don't recommend.
But the Sills voice never sounds so effortful and just thin.
But although her coloratura is excellent.

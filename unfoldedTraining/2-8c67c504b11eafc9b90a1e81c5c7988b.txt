The setting was great I really felt that it was just as the book.
The only character that was really the same as the book was Johnny.
The actors from the movie did play their part right, but I have to add they didn't show that much emotion as the characters in the book.
Like when Ponyboy was sick and everything.
I think the book was so much better!
That made it confusing if you had already read the book.
The message of the book didn't get through the movie.
It didn't discuss the themes in the book correctly.
Even though of that mistake it was just as I imagined.
It missed so much stuff.
There was one tiny little problem.
The book is awesome I seriously recommend it.
I also missed Pony's voice over in the movie, what happened with all his thoughts?
In the movie Greasers are south and Socs are north!
In the book the Greasers are east, and Socs are west.

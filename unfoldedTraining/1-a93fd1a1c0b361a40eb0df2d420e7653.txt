For now, I still am convinced that iPods are a waste of money.
'_' <Whoa!)
If you want an mp3 player, get a creative nomad!
This 4 GB iPod is more expensive than a 40 GB Creative Nomad Zen Xtra Jukebox.
Any serious music listener knows that 4 GB is hideous!
If someone can explain to me why, I will stop making fun of them.
Nanos still stink!
Who cares about what Eminem uses or what the trend is?
GASP!
Those are even better than iPods!
4.
Why do people think that iPods are so great, anyway?
That is it.
4 GB.
If you don't believe me, go ahead and compare the prices!

Legacy should have been an entirely seperate book which explores the planet of Lamarckia.Lamarckia is such an interesting idea.
Then the story becomes about sailing and biology.
The plant/foliage/being/queen thing was explored thoroughly.
Yes.
But for Legacy to be part of The Way series, I was disappointed.
From Legacy, we get to know that he's a ladies man.
That left me satisfied, at least.
which is down The Way a bit.
The story starts off well enough with Olmy having to go on a mission to Lamarckia.
Sailing?
The only time I want to read about sailing is if the ship is a huge solar sail.Another redeeming factor of Legacy is the depth in which we get to know Olmy.
Again, such a let down.
The simple idea for a Eon prequel is fascinating and using Olmy as a character in a book makes me giddy.
Unnecessary?
Olmy was a great guy in both Eon and Eternity.
For being a prequel to the great book Eon, this was a huge let down.

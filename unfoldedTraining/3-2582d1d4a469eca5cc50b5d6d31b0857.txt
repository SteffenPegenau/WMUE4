Those with Widescreen HDTV's and Home Theatres know what I'm talking about.All in all, however, the show itself is great, so it's worth picking up if you're and L&O; fan.
Was it that hard to find other pictures of the cast?2.
They are much better!
That's disappointing.
I just wish Universal would make a more quality DVD package.
FINALLY, no more double sided discs!
If this was in 5.1 surround sound and anamorphic widescreen, the set would be much better.
This set is 5 single sided discs packaged in 3 slim-cases.
Still no widescreen aspect ratio and 2.0 sound.
I love this show.
The box art is identical to season 2 with Benson & Stabler reversed.
My review is not about the show, however.
Thank God!
DVD seasons.
It is about the DVD itself.1.
A huge improvement.3.
Look at CSI, Lost, The Office, etc.

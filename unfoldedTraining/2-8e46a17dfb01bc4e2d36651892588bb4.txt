For example, the Pacific Ocean is right next to Europe (Asia doesn't exist unless you are lucky enough to hit the 1mm spot that the globe will register as Asia).
However, I did learn some new things.
As a mother and teacher, I couldn't think of a better toy.
I expect better out of Vtech!
The toy registers the correct locations now.
It's great.
I played with it while in it's box and it seemed to be great.
Much more accurate.
My children like to toy..and it's educational.
Oh well..another toy that looks great, but is a waste of money!Update: While in the store, I saw this again.
I guess we just had a defective one before.
We've had the newer one for about a year now.
When I first heard of this..I thought it sounded great.
So, I returned my defective one for the new one.
There is only South Africa..the rest of the continent...nonexistant!

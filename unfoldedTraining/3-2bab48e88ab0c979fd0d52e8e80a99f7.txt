Amoung about 100 pics I took, I bearly remember any one that does not have red eye, even though I used red-eye reduction flash.(5).
To me, this is unacceptable.(2).
This is unbelievable inconvenient.(3).
My friend has a Sony digital camera, when it is connected to PC, you see the camera like a hard drive or CD.
I think mpeg format is better.
It is very easy to download/upload files.
There is 30 seconds length limit on each movie clip.
Think about it, if you are recording a important event which last longer than 30 seconds, you are going to miss something you do not want to miss!
Only AVI format for movie clip is available.
I wouldn't have bought S40 if I knew this limit.
When reach 30 seconds, the recording stop automatically!!
Distortion on the photo edge, as you see in all other small cameras.(6).
(1).
After you start shooting movie, you can't zoom.
In S40, you can't do it this way.
File size will be smaller.(4).

It does answer the questions the veiwers have when they watch the movie.
They make understandable decisions.
If there is a conspiracy, how big is it?However, there were quite a few holes in the plot that left me with a bad taste in my mouth after the movie.
Many aspects of this movie work well.
Why would they kidnap the daughter?
Is the husband's death related in anyway?
It is fairly convoluted.
The movie just did't click for me at the end.
The pacing is good.
Why would anyone do this to Jody Foster's character?
The setting using a jumbo jet works.
Jodie Foster raises this movie above the conventional thriller.
One never has to ask why a character would do such a stupid thing.It is with the plot that I have the most trouble.
You get to see parts of the jet, for example, the cargo bay that a typical passenger never get to see.
The characters themselves are well written and believable.

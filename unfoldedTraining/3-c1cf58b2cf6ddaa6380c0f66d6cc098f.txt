Apparently no one proofreads these books.
I had read the first 2 books in this series.
First: Nina picks up a cell phone and hears a dial tone????
Shows lack of respect for the reader.
In addition to all that, the character "Paul" is a true pig.
Not sure.
In one memorable passage, he wonders to himself why he did not rape "Kim" while he had the chance.
OK it's trivial but it bothers me.
Second: Nina spots Joe the gardener wearing a straw cowboy hat, minutes later Joe and Nina are talking and Joe is holding his baseball hat in his hand.
Third: The trial begins and the name Jason Thomas De Beers is announced.
Then came this one.
I liked Nina and Collier and specially Sandy but not sure I will read the next entry in this series.
Towards the end of the trial his name becomes Jason Quentin De Beers.
OK maybe if there is absolutely nothing else for me to read...maybe...I may consider it.
I liked them.
Sees women as his inferiors who would never dare resist his sexual demands.

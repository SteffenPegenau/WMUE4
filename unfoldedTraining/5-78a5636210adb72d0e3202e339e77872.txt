As with 'The Sims : House Party', i went the first day to the shop to get it!
!
I have all the expansion packs, and they make it even more fun.
I have bean waiting 4 that.
But, with 'The Sims Online' i taught it was there.
So now i don't have to wait 'till 2002, when TSO comes out, bot only 'till Fall 2001!!
It's the best game EVER!
I didn't order it at Amazon, 'cause i live in Belgum, it's more convinient to go to the shop.
If you have TS, then i really recommend to buy one (or all) of the expansion packs.
I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!
I am so exited, and i can't wait to buy it!
I had heard about TSHD, bot i did not now if it was treu.
'The Sims : Hot date' has lots of new features, that means mor fun to play.
If you do not have 'The Sims', BUY IT!!
You can finally get in to the city!

I will say that, but, he has the biggest ego ever!!
(Why shouldn't she?)
Please try to forget the past as Loni has and get on with your life!

The book was entertaining at the beginning.
The parts I didn't like were when he started being snippy over Loni.
I loved reading about his childhood and growing up years.
Burt, other than the low-blows you wrote about your ex-wife, the book was very entertaining.
Burt's book is good.
Only fair because I read Loni's book last year and was curious to read his version of events.
Burt can be a very funny man.
How she wore a skimpy bikini around the poolman.
Okay, saw the book on the cheapo shelf at the bookstore so figured I'd read it.
Loni never once put Burt down in any shape, form or manner in her book whereas Burt seemed to think it was okay to nitpick about her every chance he got.
How she spent hours putting her makeup on.

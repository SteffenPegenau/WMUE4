Just amazing.
Start with "Golden Days", the single.
Where does that come from?
Wow.
Hopefully, this is the future of music.
Catchy to the nth degree.
I hear Queen, Whiskeytown, Lennon, Westerberg, Replacements, maybe a little G-n-R (uh-huh - that's right), Jakob Dylan (I've heard Bob in the Damnwells too, but not so much on this cd), Fleetwood Mac, Gin Blossoms, Goo Goo Dolls, Del Amitri & more.
It's infectious, well-written love.
This is big, BIG music.
The talent here is astounding.
The masses will be talking about these guys in a heartbeat.
Sounds like?
Lyrics to break your heart.
I'm in.
Favorite lyric at the moment is from "Shiny Bruise", which is a startlingly sincere song: "For every time I doubted you, I give myself a shiny bruise."
It moves you.
Just astounding.
Wow - every song is so different.

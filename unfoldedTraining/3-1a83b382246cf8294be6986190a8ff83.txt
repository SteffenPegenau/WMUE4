No more than 20 minutes into the film Bud Fox's partner, when speaking about Gekko, says that Gekko sold Nasa stock short after the Challenger blew up.
Why greed has such a bad connotation is puzzling.
!What works is Gekko's little 'Greed' speech.
More men need to start wearing suspenders (braces) again!
First of all, the little subtitle at the beginning says that the year is 1985.
I did like this movie.
The Challenger didn't explode until 1986.
Life is not a zero-sum game.
Gekko's other little diatribe toward the end of the film is pure [trash].
It's true.
If this is Stone's belief, which I'm sure it is, he's as dumb as a box of rocks.One more thing, Bud and Gordon wore awesome suits!
Plus, I didn't know that Nasa was listed on the NYSE!
However, it is full of gross exaggerations and biases that we have come to expect from Stone.
All humans are motivated by their self-interest.
Just because you make more money, for example, doesn't mean that I will make less.

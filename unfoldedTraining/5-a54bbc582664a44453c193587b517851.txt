Yet, he perseveres.
My heart goes out to him in this film.
You will be missed.
You have made a difference throughout your life and you don't realize it.
He just seems so sincere.
You may have more to offer than you ever knew.
Thank you so much for this film.
Someone somewhere does care.
Mister Capra, there is no corn here, just heart.
You made a difference to the ones you loved and loved you.
Stewart conveys the torment and despair of hopelessness brilliantly.
You made a difference no matter how insignificant to many you have made contact with.
When your back is against the wall and it seems hopeless there is still a ray of hope.
Perhaps is worth living after all.
When you are down and out put this film in and really see what it has to say.
You never know what's around the bend of life.
This is a classic film without a doubt.

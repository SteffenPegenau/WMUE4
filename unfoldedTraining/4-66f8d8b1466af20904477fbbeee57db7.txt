It's like if Usher suddenly gave the performance Jamie Foxx did in Ray.
It's as good if not better than Coal Miner's Daughter or The Buddy Holly Story -- very well-written and directed.
And then it hit me.
Yes, it glamorizes Billie and ,more significantly her man, but it really holds up as a film.
Today, people talk about Dorothy Dandridge getting nominated more - for a musical where she didn't even do her own singing.The eerie thing about watching this.
It's odd this movie isn't held in higher regard.Diana is really amazing.
It's all here.
I kept thinking, "Who does she remind me off?"
It's astonishing she never went on to have a big film career.
Why doesn't she get props for this?
No, she doesn't sound like Billie, but watching it I felt she captured something essential.
"Oh yeah, Michael."
Why has this been essentially forgotten for 30 years?
No, she doesn't look like Billie.
You can see the birth of the whole affect of Michael Jackson's various screen / video performances.

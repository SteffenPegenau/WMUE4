A Metallica song without a solo is no song at all.
They should hang it up with the new stuff and bring back the past.
The only reason I was nice enough to give this c.d two stars is because the songs where heavy.
Was that really James singing.
It sounded like some punk band lead singer who cries like a baby.
The awesome riffs, the great lyrics, insane solos.
My advice to you, buy the c.d if you like heavy stuff.
Where are the insanely good Kirk solos.
That is one thing that stayed the same.
If you love the old Metallica don't expect the same quality.
I am in love with the old Metallica.
You say that name and what do you think of?
Metallica.
I think the Metallica bus has run out of gas.
You think of the insane Metallica that I used to know who played their hearts out.
I love them.
Don't get me wrong.
Even if they redid their old stuff it would have been better then this ...
Wow.

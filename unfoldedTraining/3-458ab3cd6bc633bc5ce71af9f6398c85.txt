So good luck!
It was okay though.
This book is okay.
It was kind of hard to follow, cause a lot of things were going on at once.
I really think younger kids should read it.
I wouldn't read it more than twice.
I would recomend this book to kids from ages 9 - teens.
Read it if you would like.
In my opinion, this is book is not very exciting.
I just didn't like it.
Because then I could read a better book.
I was so glad when I finished it.
Then it got good.
But that is just in my opinon.
Rebecca has a life that i would never want.
I don't like that.
She is so happy and bouncy.
It was really boring till the end.
I don't think it deserves a classic.

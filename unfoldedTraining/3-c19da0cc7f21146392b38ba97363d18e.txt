Mark Wahlberg is the one who is doing all the talking.The DVD comes full with extra.
5 stars for the DVD.The movie is just ok to me.
After I finish the movie, I have a strong feeling that I have seen this before.
This movie is pretty scary.
The only different is that lesson from War of the World is that you should always fully cook your chicken before you eat it.Mark Wahlberg is great in this moving.
Good people find out good people are just as bad as the monster.
War of the World with Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning just come to mind.This movie is exactly the same as War of the World from start to end.
Zooey Deschanel and the other little girl do absolutely nothing to this movie.
The end.
3 stars.
Monster goes away.
I finally have the chance to see this movie.
Lesson learned.
Much much better than Tom Cruise.
Good people meet other people.
Monster comes.
Good people run.

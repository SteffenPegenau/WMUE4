The journey itself seems aimless and pointless, and no sub-plots provide relief.
3) The female characters are bland and restricted.
Result: Robbins' use of language (as fresh and agile as usual) is not enough to make me overlook the basically disappointing content of this book.
And Robbins can't seem to deny him anything.
But as soon as I start across it, I notice the scratches and dips; I hear the squeaky creaks and ominous groans.
Some protagonists you love to hate.
What is with the annoying repetition of the title phrase?)
(P.S.
Metaphors aside: 1) The book's plot wanders and stalls in a thoroughly nondelightful manner.
2) The male characters are selfish and short-sighted and not very interesting really.
It's like the hardwood floor in my living room.
Robbins most recent offering is deceptive and ultimately disappointing.
Switters just bores me.
It looks solid, level, polished.
A babe buffet for middle-aged men.

Are you growing up, Wiggles?
I also think, music recording/mixing seems screwed to me: vocals fade while instruments too loud on many songs.
And, yes, too fast on that one mexican rythm.
Children need more distinct vocals to learn the songs.
This DVD does not touch my 3 year old at all.
And too busy.
Guys overplayed in the studio.
He is a great actor and singer.
I do not rate the second half of the video, we never made it there.
Wows to Sam, though.
We love Sam and Captain.
They gave up the skivvies, traded them in for more fancy looks, there seems to be more budget for DVD, which should've been good... "wobblie camel" and "barking dog" from years ago sounds better.
I mean, we like all the guys, just not this dvd.
And offered better dancing.
We do not keep up.

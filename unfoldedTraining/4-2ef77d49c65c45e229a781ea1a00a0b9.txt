All that's missing here is the need for a pocket ful of change and the dart players that would bump into me at some critical juncture of the game.
I was never a master of the original.
.
but my friend was the best ever.
We both played this new game.
.
That was 20 years ago.
Plenty!
Just as i hoped it would be.
Good news?
Bad news?
.
Great graphics.
I spent way too much time at the local pub feeding quarters in to the arcade version of Missile Command.
it had something to do with my main activities at the bar.
.
Greatsound.
You have to keep your kids away from it if you ever want to play!

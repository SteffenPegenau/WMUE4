It has been an ongoing mess since them.
I have been escalated.
It is now August 28th.
All the products are refurbished units.
(Note: I have seen a complaint where the customer was told they do inventory for the whole month of December)They want me to pay the $20 shipping expense for a different model than I purchased.
It worked for 15 minutes.
Let it cool several days-ran for a few minutes.Called ViewSonic May 5.
They have promised me this and that.
"It's in the mail" to death...I have been told they take inventory for the whole month of July.
Any suggestions?????????
Once they sent the right model, but it worked for 15 minutes.
?
Let it cool -worked 10 minutes.
They have my money, my asset (Pj458D)...my money spent sending units back and I have ZERO, ZILCH, NADA.
Without my approval they sent me twice the wrong model.

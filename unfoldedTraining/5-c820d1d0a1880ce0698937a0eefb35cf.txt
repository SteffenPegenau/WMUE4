Who needs a handicap when the CPU is on weak?
It makes the game more fun.P.S.
If this game were easy like the other Mario Parties, it wouldn't be fun.
It is better than Mario Party 6.
But if you think it is too hard, there is something wrong with you.
Pathetic.
It isn't!
The more people, the better.
This game is by far the best Mario Party game ever!
Punching and kicking without gore is not violent.
I see some people are complaining that this game is too hard and that it is too violent.
Get used to it.
The Bowser Time is a great addition.
However, it it more fun to play with human players.
Also, this game is much harder than the other Mario Party games.

After 24 hrs of charging, the battery started crappin out after 20 mns...yes it was taking me 20 mns to shave what would normally take 5-10....not impressed and on my way to the store to return it after first use.
NOT.
Constantly flipping and turning to trim spots.

Cool design.
Outta the box i was thinkin alright.
Ridiculous.
Trimming in itself was a painful hair pulling(literally) experience.
Unless u like little nicks and pain.and now that i think about it, im taking away the one measely star i without thinking gave this sad excuse of a razor/trimmer.
BOGUS.
The razor will nick ...oh yes it will.. 4.
With every swipe, attachment or not, this thing was pullin my hair out.

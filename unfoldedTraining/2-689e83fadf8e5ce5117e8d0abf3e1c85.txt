And it rinsed clean!
I dilgently rinsed the shaver under the faucet after every shave.
Hopefully, my refund will be processed soon.
The design of the shaver heads made it virtually impossible to replace them properly.
However, after a few weeks, it needed hand cleaning.
I finally gave up and returned it to Norelco.
I purchased the Remington as a replacement.
I was initially impressed with this shaver.
Its shave is not as comfortable, but it is adequate, and it has its own cleaning system which doesn't require hand cleaning.
I opened the shaver, and cleaned the the heads.
I finally got the heads in correctly, or so I thought!
Or so I thought.
The shave was very comfortable and close.
I struggled for quite a while and could never get it right.
The shaver never operated correctly after that.

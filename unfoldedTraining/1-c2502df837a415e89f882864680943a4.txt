Because He loves Tedd a great deal.P.S.
Go ahead.
Would Jesus get a paddle to beat Tedd Tripps behind?
Think about this: Could the rod be spiritual?
Read "Spare the Child" by Philip Greven.Proverbs 13:24 He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to discipline him.Because of this verse, millions of kids have been physically abused.
Most people think that the "Rod" is a stick, belt, paddle or something physical.
Tedd.
Can you discipline your children with love, care, encouraging words, non humilifying consequences, truth, courage and by your own example?
He may want to, but He won't.
Where did Jesus tell us to beat our kids up?
Better get that millstone off from your neck buddy!
This is an epidemic.
Spank your kids so that they begin to hate you and ultimately the Lord.
You know why?
Kids grow up believing in violence, hate and aggression towards others.
You want to use yor time wisely?

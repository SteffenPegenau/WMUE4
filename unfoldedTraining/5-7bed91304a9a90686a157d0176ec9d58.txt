It is because of Lloyd that I have started making my own damn movies.
Yes, I really am making my own damn movies.
Long live Toxie... Long live LLOYD KAUFMAN!!!
This book is a MUST for learning the "ins and outs" of low budget film making.
Even if you are not making your own damn movie, it is still a great read for any Troma, Toxie, or Lloyd Kaufman fan.

(OK, I am still a little lost, as making movies is hard work, but Lloyd has helped me out!)
Lloyd Kaufman... What can I say??
I love Toxie, Tromaville, and everything about Troma.
Absolutely PRICELESS.
He IS a GOD as far as I am concerned!
It is a great read and above all - It is funny!!!
Also - I was lucky enough to meet Lloyd Kaufman recently and now I have an autographed copy of this book!!!
Without this book - I would have been lost.
That makes it priceless in my eyes!!
Nothing dull and boring here - Lloyd makes it fun to read this book.
I have learned so much from Lloyd and this book.

It was a breeze to install.
With my 5 mb Sony digital camera, and this printer, I hardly use my 35 mm SLR camera anymore.
Just bought it.
Remember to set the paper type before you print photos, otherwise you get messed up photos.
Good ink system, that will hopefully save me some money.
Definately better than the HP Photosmart 100 that I bought last year.
Recommend for home use.
Normal text printing is quite fast as well.
This one does not have a memory stick interface, so you will need a computer to print.
Plus Canon ink cartrdiges are cheaper than HPs.
Printer technology is improving dramatically.
Canon has 4 ink system with visual indicators.
Prints great 8x10 photos on matte paper.
With HP, U have to junk the entire cartridge, even if a single color is out.
so you buy just the one you need.

A plus is the quietness.
The rifle itself is a mixed review.
No problem hitting a tin can at 20 yards, but not precise.
Also there is no recoil like a springer so it is good for practice shooting.Update, the company contacted me.
Accuracy hard to assess with standard sights.
The 5 round clip is soft rubber , it also binds and doesn't always index and pellets fall out and jam action.
Also the bolt would not close once.
Effort might be too much for youngsters.
The same rifle is available elsewhere as a kit.
Ok for plinking only.
this is just the rifle with a single shot and 5 round clip.
The stock and feel of the rifle is nice.
This is not the kit as on other sites with included targets, sights, pellets etc.
The listing is not their error, they are aware of the problem.
It is the quietest air rifle I have out of several springers, a CO2, and another pump up.
The issues are the cocking arm is flimsy and binds on cocking.

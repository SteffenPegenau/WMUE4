Big disappointment.
Very nice, but not something I like hearing in August.
You need an album of originals, with maybe a cover tune thrown it.
Honestly I like Clay alot, but he won't last long making people wait three years and still not do anything orginal.
What a great CD that was.
Three years have passed since the debut from Clay.
You have done well with them, but I know all the tunes and won't be playing them over and over.
It was the followed by an album of Christmas tunes.
Come on Clay.
THREE years and we get a pile of cover tunes?
You're kidding right?
A new album from Clay.
But what the heck, it's all covers!
Finally!
You're a big talent, don't be wasting it churning out remolded cover tunes.
Talent =10, Originality=5.I can see it now, November 2009 and Clay's next album will be a greatest hits collection of all the covers from this, covers from the Christmas album, and maybe one or two originals from the debut album.

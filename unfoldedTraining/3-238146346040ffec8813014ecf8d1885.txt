If I had to do away with one, it would be Hotspace.
If you really want to get the full Queen experience, start with Live at the Beeb.
Get them all.There's no way around it.
By the way, Metallica redid Stonecold Crazy, not the otherway around.
You won't regret it.
An amazing performer.
American Idol sucks!
Til then "The Show Must Go On!!!"
Queen has so many songs that were not showcased in the popular music genre, but were nothing less than fantastic.
Saw him in San Antonio a few years ago and he brought the house down.
Get all others.
Oh, if Queen were to go back on the road they need to get that Miller guy.
Just wanted to state that.
Can't remember his first name right now, but he's Freddy Mercury re-incarnated.
Just thought i'd share that.
Then Queen, Queen 2, Sheer Heart Attack, so on and so forth.
Had everyone on their feet throughout the show.

These are generic (who knows if they work) garbage.
Some people are happy with that.
Amazon should remove this seller and relegate them to eBay where you can be assured to be ripped off.
These are not Hoover filters as advertised.
I will attempt to return.
They come in a bag with newspaper around them with no protection.
At least buy and resell fake filters with Hoover stamped on them.
Completely unhappy and I have only had this problem with one other 3rd party vendor on Amazon.
Mine are bent.
This vendor borders on fraud.
If you sell a generic item STATE THIS.
Shipping took forever.
I am not.
Well over 2 weeks and vendor lied about shipping date.
Then maybe people like me might be duped into thinking this is the real thing.

"The Ruins" gets my vote for the most overrated book of 2006.
It was always just words on a page.
But my biggest complaint is that Smith TELLS us everything.
A half-hearted attempt is made to imply that one of the group that sets forth for the ruins might not be all that they seem, but it never goes anywhere.
The four American characters are indistinguishable from each other.
It's predictable.
This is one of those books I wish I'd stopped reading about halfway through.
And the writing itself is paltry.
It's boring.
It's pretty plain.
Someone has curly brown hair.
Plants are green and red.
A hat is blue.
Very little is SHOWN.
The end effect is like listening to a very long-winded acquaintance tell you about the bad vacation of someone they know.
Very little description of the world which resulted in my never crossing that boundary where you start to live out the events happening in the book.

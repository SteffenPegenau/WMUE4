I love period pieces, especially Jane Austen and MOST especially P&P.
; But I cannot even finish this.
The writing is bad - even the authentic Jane Austen dialogue comes across poorly here!
I do not know what people who like this version were watching.
But it is HORRIBLE.
I tried.
I really tried.
But this Darcy is DREADFUL.
(I don't understand the reviews calling this the most authentic version; I strongly disagree!
HORRIBLE!The acting is bad.
Blech.
)and don't even get me started on Mr. Darcy.
When I read reviews stating that this version was better than Colin Firth, I thought that I was in for a huge treat.
I couldn't even watch this all the way through.
None of the characters come across they way Austen described them in the book.
huh????

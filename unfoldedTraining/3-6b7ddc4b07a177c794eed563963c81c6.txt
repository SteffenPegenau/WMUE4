MOMO's "grant me a miracle" had me wishing for a miracle.
anyway I still have not completed the game and I plan on it just needed to get that off my chest.
Graphic are amazing!!!
I would like to start off with the good things about the game.
WOW!
All things aside who play tested the games and said that the combat was ok?
(which I still have not had the heart to beat).
Not to mention the endless one liners during the fight.
The story is very good.
Combat.....WTF XENOSAGA!Had to start a pharagraph for this one.
Very deep plot with epic twists and crazy characters.
Music lacked a bit but not going to cry.
New character models were unneeded but I'll take it.
The whole "stocking up" before you can do damage is just not fun.
This game is so fustration when you have 6-7 minutes fights that you cannot avoid.

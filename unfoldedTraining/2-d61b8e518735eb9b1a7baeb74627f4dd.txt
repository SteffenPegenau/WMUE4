Calling is out of the question because the phone number is for the company in Korea.
At first it bunched the tape inside.
That was a mistake!
I purchased this in Jan 08.
It was easy to get the tape out this time.
That took at least 2 hours with tweezers to pull it out.
After reading through the manuel (finding 4 spelling mistakes) I got it working and it was great.
I tried to email the company and still have not heard from them.
A couple of cassettes later I tried it with a hard to find cassette.
By July I was no longer able to use for fear of destroying my cassettes.
I thought it might have been just a freak occurrence, so I tried it again.
When I pulled it out of the box and installed it the cassette door was broken and slid down so I couldn't insert any cassette.
It bunch up the tape so bad it took a couple of hours to finally get it freed just to find out it also broke the tape.
It worked fine.
It has sat unused for 3 months.

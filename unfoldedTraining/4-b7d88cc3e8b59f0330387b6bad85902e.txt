Oh and I saw a review that was labeled "Too Fast".
I finished it in 2 days!
It was really hard to guess who the culprit was this time.
I didn't read the review but I think that this game did go a little too fast.
I didn't hate ANYONE because they were all pretty cool.
I mean not too fast for you to follow but you finish it too fast.
It's not really scary at all.
I definitely think you should buy this one.
The first Nancy Drew game I finished took me 7 days!
Big difference.
This one might be a little bit too easy or maybe just to some of us.
Nevertheless, this one was FUN!
This one was one of my 2 favorite Nancy Drew games!
The new added feature this time is a cell phone!
Just a little.
It's not extremely spooky so you don't have to get too scared about it.
Once again, this is another one of the better Nancy Drew games.
Nancy receives calls while she's out and about and she can make phone calls anywhere she wants!

there are about three enemys that dont look the same.and there are only 4 hard fights in the entire game.
once i ran into the center of a group of enemys and i stood still.
Ive never been a big fan of dynasty warriors.
But this game is just bad.
and either way it is still garbage.
And one hit kills petty much all enemys.
Also THIS GAME IS REPETTATIVE.
First off on easy mode you can defat an entire army by yourself.
you have 6 attacks per character but they all do the exact same thing.
Also all of the soldgers look identical.
Now this game is long but so what.
If you have a huge pile of garbage, is it really any better then a small pile of garbage.
This is because the enemys never attack.
I didn't get attacked for ten minutes.
just like this game.

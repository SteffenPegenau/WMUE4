Damn thing can't get in connect mode.
And Yes I am in ECP mode!
The major problem is that if you have one you are screwed.
Do not buy this product.

I got the Cabo as a present....a present from hell.
The company who puts it out - Best Data - has the worst tech support and customer service that I have ever encountered.
You will get screwed, you will pay for horrible tech support, you will say I should have listened to that guy from Amazon.
Do not buy anythig from Best Data.
They charged me to help me with exactly nothing.
What's worse is that you are forced to call them because the manual (best use for it is picking up after your dog) is terrible and their Web site is equally awful.
Still got errors, errors.

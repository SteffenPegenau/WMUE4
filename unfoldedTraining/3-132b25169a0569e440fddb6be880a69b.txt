These are all words that accurately summarize Otherland: City of Golden Shadow.
Few books, of this genre especially, bring me back to buy expensive sequels.
They are vibrant.Slow?
Like the world it depicts, this novel is consuming to the nth degree.
This isn't a novel that is served well by a fast pace.
Tres bien, Williams.Best attributes: the characters.
Maybe I would have gotten more work done.
I just wish Williams' editor had convinced him to axe about three hundred pages.
To a certain extent, this is forgivable.
Not this one, though.
Other novels with more ... predictable structures can lose me as a reader if I'm too busy.
This book may have been painfully slow, but that didn't stop me from taking a day off from work because I couldn't put it down.
Awkward?
Meandering?

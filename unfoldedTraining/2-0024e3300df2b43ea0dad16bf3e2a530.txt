I passed 22 cars at once because they were stopped going into 1st turn, backed up all the way down the straight.
So why only 2 stars?
All the tracks are fantastic, the graphics are great, the cockpit view is superb.
Well, if the car in front stops, then all the cars will stop.
If you hit the grass, your speed instantly drops to 40 mph, no matter how fast you're going.
This game could have been great, but the unrealistic (lack of) racing on the computer's part coupled with the silly physics of no crashes and no spinouts ruins this title for me.
This game could have been great.
Sounds realistic, right?
Also, there are no crashes, you just sort of bump off your opponent, bump off the wall.
The cars take 1 or 2 paths around the track and rarely pass.
Literally.
It is good for a rent, but I'd recommend not buying it.
Stop, dead in the track.
The computers AI is horrible.
You never spin out.

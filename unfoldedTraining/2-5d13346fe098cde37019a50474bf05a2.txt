Dissing Snopp and Dre.
The unrealesed Pac videos are exactly the same but with a few scenes changed.
When i ordered the video i couldnt wait to get it.
Some good X-rated stuff.
Let me start off by saying iam one of the biggest tupac/death row fans in the world.
NEGATIVES: Only about 3-4 of the videos are finished properly.
The video is all hype.
Now that i have it i wish i had my money back.
Behind the scenes pac material.
I WISH I GOULD GET MY MONEY BACK.
Let me tell you all what happens in the video: POSITIVES: A few Tupac concert performences that are cut short anyway.
Nothing really exciting.
BUYERS ARE BETTER OFF BUYING A BACKYARD JOB OFF OF EBAY OR SOMETHING IF THEY WANT FULL FILM CLIPS.THE BOTTEM LINE IS DONT BUY THIS TAPE, ITS A WASTE OF 2 HOURS, AND A WASTE OF CA$H.
AND THE CUTTING OUT OF THE VIDEOS.
All the videos are BS and cut-short.
Bunch of mark A$$ tricks who sit in a car that think they know what death row was all about.

!Since I am a market investor, I would like more information on hedge fund investing.
!
THERE NOT!
Start with basics, then build on these.
ALL acronyms (wordS into 1st letters) and ALL hedge fund concepts should be in the "Glossary" in minute detail.
There are other references with no way to learn the details!

This is so that the average investor can understand the hedge fund concepts and ALWAYS have a place to go to to lookup the meanings.
Then explain how and where they are appropriately used, taking into account how to judge risk.Since hedge funds are not advaertised, how do you learn of the names & contacts of different hedge funds and their style or objectives in order to evaluate?How do I find the "Capco's recent report", Chapter 4, page 53?There is no detail reference!
!
The text can then explain IN DETAIL how the concepts are used.The text should be rewritten like a course primer.

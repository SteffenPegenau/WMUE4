They are so interesting and once you pick one up (even if you've already read it) you can't put it down.
AWESOME WRITING!!
It's not like some of the other fantasy books I've read.
They have almost real life characters and they are so interesting.
I mean J.K. Rowling wrote them so well you feel like you're in the book.
I can't wait for the rest of the books to come out.
I'm not a person who likes to read a lot, but boy did those H.P.
By the time you are done the book you feel like you know the characters as personal friends.
books grab me by suprise.
They are the best books I have ever read in my life.
I love the Harry Potter Books.
I can't stop reading and loving them.
J.K.Rowling... just want you to know...
These are way better.
You can see vivid pictures in your mind of what you're reading.

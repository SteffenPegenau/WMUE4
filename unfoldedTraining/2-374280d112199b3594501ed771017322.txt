NOT A SINGLE NEW FIGHTER WAS INTRODUCED.
BUT TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS NOTHING I HADN'T PLAYED BEFORE YEARS AGO.
I LIKE USING BUTTONS TO CREATE COMBOS.
BUT BETTER GAME.
MY REVIEW HAS A HAPPY ENDING ATLEAST FOR ME, NOT THE GAME.
IT IS ALSO HARD TO PLAY A FIGHTING GAME THAT REQUIRERS YOU TO KEEP BOTH THUMBS ON TWO JOY STICKS.
THE USED PRICE FOR "SUPER MONKEY BALL" JUST HAPPENED TO BE [X] SO I MADE AN EVEN TRADE FOR A SLIGHTLY OLDER..
I ENDED UP PATTING MYSELF ON THE BACK.
I PAYED [X] FOR THIS GAME.
I PURCHASED THIS GAME BECAUSE I LOVE THE FIGHTING GAME GENRE.
I LOVE STREET FIGHTER, BUT ENOUGH ALREADY!
I RECEIVED [X] CREDIT FOR IT AT A LOCAL TRADE IN GAME STORE.
THE BUTTONS ARE ALMOST UNUSED FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN THE FIGHTING GAME GENRE, AND WHILE CHANGE IS GOOD..
IF IT ISN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT.
2-D IS FINE, BUT SOME 3-D FEATURES WOULD BE NICE.

He hated everything about America.
One day he took his family to an island called Jeronimo.
allie Fox always think that America was an awful country.
But there an explotion happened.
But in the end when Allie was died, his family realize how much they loved allie.I like this story because the plot of the story was very unpredictable.
He always wanted his family to do what he told.
This story taught us that we have to hear everyone opinion.
In there he and his family started a new life.
The people, the bilding, everything.
The story is about the Fox's family.
They had to find a new place.Allie was very stuborn.
His family was suffer in there.
The character were very unique and unusual.
Allie was happy in there, but not the rest of his family.
Sometime his family really hated him.

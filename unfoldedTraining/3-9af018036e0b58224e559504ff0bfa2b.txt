So this is a great TV, but you may have to do a little maintenance to it occasionally.
So you have to choose which device you want HDMI??
The picture quality was crystal clear, even at 15 feet away where I normally view it.
It is a great TV, until recently.
The DVD will freeze or skip in the middle of the movie.
Blue ray or cable box?
I will do it myself for $70, but the repair man told me to always stay away from LCDTV/DVD players because he always gets calls on them freezing or going bad.
TV Repair est.
He told me to save some money and replace the main board on my own and he showed me how to do it.
was around $310.
I bought this TV 5 years ago for around $700.
Another downside, there is only 1 HDMI port.
I haven't had any problems with the audio.
The DVD player is really frustrating and I would suggest staying away from TV/DVD combos period.
This TV recently had a bad main board in it, which from reviews on the internet I find is normal for this TV.

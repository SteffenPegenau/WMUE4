The story just did not draw me in.
I have liked most of his films.
I was very disappointed in this film from Scott.
I didn't think the action scenes were that impressive.
I did think Crowe did a good job in the film.
That film had heart, while this film seemed cold and distant.
I am sure Scott and Crowe will bounce back with their next projects.
It was to expected after standout performances in LA Confidential and The Insider.
Russell Crowe's character was never really challenged throughout the film.
A similar film is Braveheart.
Everything looked too easy for Crowe's character (I know I am repeating myself here).
That film thrust you into the battle scenes and made you care about William Wallace.
It is just disheartening when a good director and a good actor get together and they make a mediocre film.
The first battle, you couldn't see what was going on in it.
Braveheart is a much better film than this.

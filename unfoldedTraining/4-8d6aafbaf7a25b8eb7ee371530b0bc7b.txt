I doubt that I can improve on other's reviews so I won't try.
I have owned other releases of this and this is by far the best one.
Was this a reference to Swan Lake?
When Elizabeth escapes to the, what should I call it, shelter near a lake during a rainstorm and Mr. Darcy follows her and they argue was a great scene.
Judi Dench and Kiera's rapid fire repartées are beautiful to behold.
Well, who doesn't need that?
The musical sound is exceptionable.
Jena Malone's turn as the silly fifteen year old sister.
I especially like Kiera Knightly's efforts.
Brenda Blethyn as nearly insufferable Mama.
The transfer is top notch.
All the actors are invested in their role.
Clear and bright.
I received the Blu-Ray version today and was totally unprepared for the audio track.
A suggestion that Elizabeth was a "swan" who needed love to become human?
Donald Sutherland as long suffering Papa.
At the end when the view of Mr. Darcy's home across the lake was shown, there were swans swimming about.

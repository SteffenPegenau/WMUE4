This is absolutely NOT what I was looking for.
I found this CD in the World Music section under TIBET.
Sounds like New Age music.
OH NO!
I looked at the booklet and what jumped out was ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENTS.
All I had to go on is the front and back cover information and photos.
There is a disturbing lack of information on the performers or musicians.
I bought it.
If I had only listened to samples of the music FIRST!
Are they even Tibetian?
I feel like I was suckered into buying this.
As soon as I opened it and started to play it, something seemed seriously wrong.
Where WAS this recorded?
Are they monks?
There is a photo of a monk but he is not identified.

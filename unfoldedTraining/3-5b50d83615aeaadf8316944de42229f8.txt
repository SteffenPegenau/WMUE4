I would say 95% of the movie workedin 3d.
I have been a fan of 3d movies my whole life.
You can find this movie on amazon and ebay for a buck.
I have seen horrible 3d movies on dvd like The Polar Express.
I hoped I would get the same experience when I got the dvd.
The movie itself would be fair to good if not for the 3d effects.
I am the first one who will scream about a bad 3d movie on dvd.
I am going to buy another copy for my brother who is also a big film buff, and I know he will agree.
Great movie, but what they did to the 3d in polar express was a crime.
I was amazed.
The 3d does workand it looks great.
that's how much I paid for a used copy.
Very close to the way it looked in the theatre.
Not all the 3d effects worked.
I saw MBV in the theatre and loved the 3d.

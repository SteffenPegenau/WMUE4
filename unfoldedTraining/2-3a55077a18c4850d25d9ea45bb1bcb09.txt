When Halloween came insteas of trick-or-treating, they sneek out to go play the game.
Then a murder happens in the neighborhood which causes them not to be able to go outside and play thier game.
Two annoying 6th graders caught them.
Then they make up a game calledThe Eggypt Game.
So at the end all the friends finished the game.
Then they tried an oracle .
And a new girl , Elizabeth joins in .
It wasn't all that exciting , but it was o.k.
After that, they created a new alphbet and rituals/cerimonies .
They ended up joining.
They found out that one of the 6th graders did it.
It starts out with a girl named April who meets a girl named Melaine and her brother Marshall.

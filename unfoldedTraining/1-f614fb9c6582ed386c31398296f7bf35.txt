Bought a philps 5982 and have had no problems.Pros: Great picture.
Performed very well with the divx test cd 2.0.
Could be region free.
Screen saver a plus.
I would lower my rating to 2 stars ** if I could.
Great picture.
Manual fails to mention you must have the dvd player hooked up via standard video mode for initial setup.
So far it has played every disc I have tried.
Plays divx, and xvid.
Automatically sets picture format.Cons: Very flimsy cd/dvd tray.
Addendum.... Well after a year of low use the toshiba has become quite finicky and freezes on many dvds.
RGB Composite mode hookup out of the box only shows a blank screen.
Search videohelp.com sd-3990.
Plays dvdr+ and dvdrw+ although the manual does not state it.

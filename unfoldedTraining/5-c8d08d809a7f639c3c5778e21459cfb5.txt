In war the winds of death blow each way you turn and it holds true in everyday life.
Somebody always gets hurt.
They were lucky.
In my case I made it.
But with a little help from your crew mates you can make it.
Some of us will make it, some wont'.The crew of the Memphis Belle was a team and a team has to work together in war if you hope to win the battle against an enemy you can't see.
The guys on the Memphis Belle made it.
I was lucky.
If you make it call it luck.
We've got to work with the team, not against it.
Whoever wins turns out to be a loser.Call it luck on a plate of ice.Best wishes.
Nobody knows if you're going to make it.
The Memphis Belle says it all.
It could have gone the the other way, like the plane that got cut in two by a damaged enemy plane.War is the great enemy.
In war you live or die.
In war life and death are always staring you in the face, telling you don't count on anything.

Buy The Way of the Green Witch By Arin Murphy-Hiscock if you want to learn about green witchcraft.
If you are looking for a book on being a green witch this book is not for you.
This is just my opinion so feel free to read it and form your own.
I am glad I only paid $1.20 for this book.
Green witchcraft is not about ceremonies or casting circles or reading tarot cards.
So in that case I suggest you read Scott Cunningham.
Planting flowers and herbs and veggie gardens.
Really where is the Fairylore and the info on herbs is really sketchy.
Most of the book is the author rambling along about the history of witchcraft and repeating herself alot.
I have no idea what tarot reading has to do with being a green witch.
Tending nature.
This is just about witchcraft.
If you want to learn about the history of witchcraft buy Green Witchcraft.
It is about nature.
Trees and flowers and animals and getting in touch with them.
The book has some pretty illustrations but that's about it.

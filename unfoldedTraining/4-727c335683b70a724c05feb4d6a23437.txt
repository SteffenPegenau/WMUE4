Love it to death.
They have toned down their sound going from post hardcoreish to complete indie experimental bliss.
I can't stress enough how much people should get this.
I would say tracks 2-5 are the best.
What a great talent.
It is really a great album.
I really think he has one of the best voices in this genre.
If you are into bands like the appleseed cast, you need to own this.
I feel very strongly that this CD is one of the best of 2006.
The only complaint would be that the vocals might have been recorded too low?
I don't know much about that type of stuff though.
Gabe's vocals soar on this album.
So buy this CD.EDIT:18 months later, I wish I gave this CD 5 stars.
Albert React has always been an underappreciated band.
I am very saddened that Albert React didn't get signed by a better label, no offense to CI but the world needs to be able to enjoy this music.

If you want an entertaining read.
If you are looking for a survival book check into SAS survival handbook or something of that nature.
So why no 5 star rating like most of the others?
He doesn't know much about combat for another.
But it is a very short book, the information contained is inaccurate and it comes off as a little silly.
Yes I am into the zombie genre of fiction.
And lastly he knows very little about survival.
Yes I have read World War Z.
Beyond that it really is just a misinformed author giving advise on topics he has no idea about.
This can kind of give you that.
So in a tongue in cheek sort of way it is entertaining.
This was an interesting read.
Well the author doesn't know much about firearms for one thing.
I couldn't give it 1 star because it does actually have some entertainment value.
I guess in a tongue in cheek kind of way.

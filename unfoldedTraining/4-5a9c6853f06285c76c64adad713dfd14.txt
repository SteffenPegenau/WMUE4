Having a digital watch without a backlight is a bit dumb.
I remember thinking "Holy Cow!"
" A hundred bucks for a watch?"
It is comfortable and and keeps steady time.
If you have fat fingers forget about it.
I also remember the $99.00 price tag that was on it!
If you have a flashlight handy in the dark and a free hand to use it well then I guess it's OK.
The calculator is functional unless you have trouble seeing small things.
I thought this one had one but I guess I didn't see that in the description.
The rest of the watch is good.
The only problem is it could use a backlight function.
It has two alarms and they work well.
I remember thinking how cool!
I spent about $16.00 on this model and it is well worth it.
I remember being a child in the late 1970's growing up on the east coast in New Jersey and going into Manhattan on the weekends with my Father.
I remember seeing the Casio Calculator Watch in all the electronics store's window displays.

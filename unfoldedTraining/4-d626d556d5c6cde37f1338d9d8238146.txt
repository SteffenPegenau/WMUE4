This was the version I've always liked anyway.
Then later on, he will ask to see it again.It is really a cute cartoon, and the dvd shows great.
It has continuous playing as well.
He likes to watch those as well.
He will sit and watch all the shows if you let him.
This show can be costly, so I do shop around.
My grandson really likes the Berenstain Bears.
I will buy more dvd's.
The previews are a nice addition.
I bought another dvd before, and his mom said he liked the show.
The smile on his face is worth it alone.
Though there are some episodes on that one I feel are for older children after watching it, he started liking the bears.
Everytime he visits, he wants to see this show.
I bought the newer version later on, which was more kid appropriate.
There are six episodes to watch.

But here it just seems like, well, like bad grammar!
Smoky the Cowhorse is a boring book.
Or in a book written in the first person.
I mean it.
"I suppose writing standards were different back in the `20's; this book won the Newberry Medal.
And it keeps changing tense!
I guess it's "the life of a cowhorse", but Black Beauty was way more interesting than this was.
There's little conversation-at least in Black Beauty the horses talked to each other.
Or "He looks at the horse, and then he walked away.
But this one, well...It doesn't have much of a plot.
And I usually love books about horses.
I'm a very patient reader and I don't give up on books easily.
Still, I wouldn't recommend it.
It'll say something like "`I'll go over there,' he says, and then he got up and went to the barn.'
I really didn't find it at all engaging.The grammar is awful.
Sure, I don't mind that in conversation.
It gives it a certain tone.

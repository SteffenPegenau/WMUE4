Perhaps it may worth the time due to drawings.
Emotionless.
It won't be the next Star Wars hit.Story.
There are better things you may buy:Superdimensional fortress Macross, Sol Bianca, Bubblegum crisis chapter 1 to 4, Wings of Honneamise.If you see this movie on the shelves, leave it there and warn your friends.
1 star.
Impressive.Sound.
Animation and drawings.
Surprising solutions came from nowhere.
3 stars.
Relationship between two main characters (both female) seem like an affair, not like a friendship.Feeling.
Good but not outstanding.
5 stars.
Except for topless it is not quite interesting.
Just for rent.
No drama.
Too fast.
But if you spend money...

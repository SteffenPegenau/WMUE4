was very funny to see.
fought there way through a mine field.
British submarine.
and fighting their was best action of the movie.
running low on oil.
WE Dive At Dawn Was not a very good movie.
and then I sub-net that they pushed through.
an ok movie.
but sound was bad.
movie was very poor.
goes to denmark to take on some germans at port.
was better..
there crew were after a german battleship.
of denmark land.
"brandenburg" Not sure if they even got it.
stick with run silent run deep.

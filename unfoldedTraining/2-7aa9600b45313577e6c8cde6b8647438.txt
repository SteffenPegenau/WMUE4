I can't tell you how disappointing this is.
Some other method would be better.
There recommendation was to turn the system on for 6 hours and then run a full tank of Distilled Vinegar to clean it out.
Now the good part...
Finally called Breville Support.
Had some issues with the filters clogging but solved that with using filtered water.
So, buyer beware!Breville ESP8XL Cafe Roma Stainless Espresso Maker
They also said the the unit is no longer manufactured and there are no spare parts in their pipeline.
That's it.
Even with doing regular descaling procedures, two weeks ago the heating element stopped working.
They'll give you a 20% discount on a new unit at the $500-600 range.
I bought this unit about 3 years ago and have been very satisfied with the flavorful espresso it constantly produced.
Tried running another descale,....same result.
That didn't work either.
The water reservoir level is impossible to see, so you might just as well not have it there.

She's needy.
Dependant upon him to protect her (which, by the way, he doesn't do very well).It was a decent read with a good plot.
Strength with compassion.Where I get caught is with Claire.
But without being able to identify with the heroine, the book was just flat for me.
She avoided further scandal and sheltered herself away from life.She doesn't come to Jacob as a woman on her own.
She was weak.
I just didn't like her.
She ran away from her problems.
You find yourself in love.It sounded great on the back of the book.
Get married, inherit the money, and help the woman who raised you live for a few more years.
Only, in the middle of the plan, the unexpected happens.
Strong, competant, rich.
She married Jacob, a complete stranger, to protect her.
And everyone else is right - Jacob is a hero's hero.
It even sounded great for the first few chapters.
He takes in strays, makes them well, and sends them on their way.

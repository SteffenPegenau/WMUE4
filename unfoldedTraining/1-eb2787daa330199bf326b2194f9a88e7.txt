Mom to 4 kids under age 5.
I am soooo pissed.
If I gave this for a gift, it would look like I perused my kids' play room, grabbed a bunch of used stuff and threw it in a bag.
No instructions.
This was supposed to be a convenience.
Not anymore.
I ordered this as a present and it came all in pieces in a plastic bag.
And I was planning for this to be my go to gift for all my son's friends.
Like I have time now to return this mess of a present to UPS.
No box like described.
Now I can't gift it to him and have to get myself up and out with the flu to get another gift.
This company I will NEVER order from again.
But I will be...How dare this company really send out something like this?!!
My son even told the little boy what his gift was going to be.
Bad business.

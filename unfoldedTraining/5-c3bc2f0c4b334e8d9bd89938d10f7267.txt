We used it so much over the course of a couple years that it finally just tuckered out.
Before I had this one, I had the Bissell Litte Green Machine.
I also use the manual mode to clean up larger messes or the carpets in my van.
Got Puke?
Pets?
We replaced that with this one.
It works well for cleaning up any of the messes life brings you.
I don't doubt we use this for something at least 5-6 times each week.
I loved that one too.
My husband even commented he loved it and that it was worth the money.
That says alot!
Pee?
You can't go wrong with Bissell's Compact Deep Cleaners.

Are you a bit of a klutz?Then you NEED this machine.

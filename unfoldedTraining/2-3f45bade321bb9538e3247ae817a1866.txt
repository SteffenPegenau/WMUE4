So they turned to covers songs to try and reach the masses.
Then I realized that this is serious.
That is all you need in this band.
But I can't stand the CD.
Guitar, Bass Guitar, Drums, Vocals.
No Sequencers!Anyhow, keep putting out new CD's.
There is not one song that makes me want to play this again.
I understand that after soooo much time off they needed to change a little.
Perhaps the next one will be better.Good to have you back.
Why the cover songs?
I just can't get into it.
Cuz, there tain't nothin worth playing on the radio.
I hate the "Back in Black" cover, Yikes Corey!At first I thought it was a joke.
I dig how heavy Vernon's guitar is but the songs just don't work for me.
And what is with all the electronic noises and crazy rythyms.

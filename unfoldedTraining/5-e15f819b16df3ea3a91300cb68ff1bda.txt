I literally closed the last page and said WOW.
I would take some time to read this book, it has some crazy twists.
Ok, I picked this book up 6 months ago.
Once I got over the hump of 100 pages I couldn't put it down.
First Helen the mother in law, then Kent the son in law.
This book is two stories that constantley over lap.
It is a page turner.
Helen can actually see and hear heaven.
Kent is in a battle for his soul.
You really wont know if Kent choses God or Satan until the last few chapters.
I don't want to give to much away but I have never read a Christian book where someone goes off the deep end as much as Kent does.
I see and hear God everyday but Helen actually saw Heaven open like a seam in the sky.
I read the first few chapters and then put it down.
Well, a few days ago I ran out of books to read so I picked this one back up.
A little much for me to swallow.

I think I must have all the really good ones now (all early) except for New Jazz Conceptions (1956).
I really don't like that one at all.
I did not realize that all of the tracks but two had been recorded before on other albums (which I already have).
The last three albums have been disappointments in various ways.
35 minutes?!
So I was not listening to anything new, except in the sense that Bill never plays any tune the same way twice.
Also I felt rather cheated by Verve in that the amount of music on this CD amounts to about 35 minutes.
This one as already noted.
Based upon the other reviews I bought this album.
The Paris 1 concert for example - not the classic Bill Evans.
I should have done "due diligence".
I think I've reached the limit on my Bill Evans buying.
I might go for that one just to see what REALLY EARLY was!
Bill's earlier albums were all generous with material, with most coming in at 50 minutes or more.
And 'You must believe in Spring'.

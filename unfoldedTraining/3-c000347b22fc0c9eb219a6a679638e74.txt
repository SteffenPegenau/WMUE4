My memories feel a bit soiled as well.
I'm giving it three stars just for Burt's gutsy approach.
Now about that cover...
Though it is a must read for any real retro-Batman fan.
Who knew these sexcapades were going on?
But I did snicker a few times (along with some grimacing).
Sigh.
WHY?
I don't even know where to begin.
WHY WOULD'YA DO IT TO US????
As much as I have grown to love anything retro - the cheesier the better, in fact - I did feel a bit dirty after reading this.
You know, I loved Batman - the original series with Adam West and Burt Ward from watching the show religiously as a child - this was amazing, campy brain candy.
WHY?
Well, let's see... to begin with, it's not a non-fiction masterpiece.
Great guests, funny (yet crazy) plots, all of that Holy Batman dialogue and animated "POW" and "WAM" nonsense.
BURT!
Just be prepared... Be very prepared...
I'd better stop here.

If you want to check out the mind of Shorter as a COMPOSER where he exerts control over all aspect of the music, you must check out this CD.
Not a lot of room for expression of the sidemen.
I'm saddened that it's not available for download.
Almost through composed.
.
It's very tight.
If you're looking for blowing and those great Blue Note sides of Wayne Shorter the player and giant COMPOSER, of his jazz classics, this is not the one for you.
But this CD is not ABOUT those recordings.
I have it on vinyl.
OK, I know fellow jazz heads, this is not Speak No Evil or Schizophrenia, Ju JU, Adams Apple, etc.
Not a lot of blowing.
It definitely takes listening with new ears.
This CD celebrates his writing for larger, post Weather Report, ensembles.
This is a GREAT record.
Endangered Species, Three Marias, .
for this style of Shorter this is his great one -- much better than High Life or his more recent Alegria, as far as I'm concerned.

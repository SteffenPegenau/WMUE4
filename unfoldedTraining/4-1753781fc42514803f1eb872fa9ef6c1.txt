These headphones could easily double for DJ use or reference listening purposes.
Lifetime warranty included.
They are well constructed and most of all comfortable.
I have heard many headphones... Sony MDR-V500's, MDR-V700's, and MDR-V600's.
I'm an audio enthusiast.
Highly critical of the sounds I listen to and through the headphones delivering the highs, mids, and lows.
We'll see.
These offer a suitable replacement without the high cost.
The single wire conncetion to the left side makes them even more less likely to tangle and are reinforced to make sure they last a long life.
These are very good headphones.
Nice isolation of removing the outside noise... but really warm low ends (deeper bass response) and nice mid and high end frequency responses.
Hmmmmmm.
Initial impression?
Very surprised by the cery good sound and affordable pricing.
Not the best but perform solidly.

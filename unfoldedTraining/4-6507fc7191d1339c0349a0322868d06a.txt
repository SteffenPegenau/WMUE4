I finally got this book and both copies too.
I see her on VH1 and E Entertainment all the time these days.
There are so many stories and so many photos.
Nothing wrong with that!
The original hardcover and the reissue paperback.
This is one book that will be talked about for years and years to come.
I would tell anyone to get this book.
It took me two days to read and I LOVED it.
I await the follow up to her story and hearing about her life now.
The photos are so great.
Bebe Buell is a stunning woman.
All of it!
All I've got to say is I was not at all let down by the book or how it was written or the content.
She loves herself too, lol.
I'm sure it is as exciting as it was in Rebel Heart and if not it will surely be as interesting.
I was pleasantly surprised how sweet and candid Bebe is.

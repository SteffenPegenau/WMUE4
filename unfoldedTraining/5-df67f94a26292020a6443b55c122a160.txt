I visited friends over the holidays and simply took the SD card out of the camera and let them have their pictures prior to leaving their house and coming home.
The SD card slides into one end and there is a cap to cover it.
No big deal.
Carry an extra SD card for your camera.
It's simple and works.
It fits in the pocket of a shirt or pants.
The USB plug is the other end.
No software needed.
(see pic on Amozaon's page)
It works...that simple.
There are two caps and one central (body) unit that holds the SD card (cap #1) and contains the USB plug (cap #2).
You can use it to store documents as well as photos.
Don't loose the caps.
I received the product and couldn't find anything I didn't like about it.
I read a couple of negative reviews prior to ordering.
Three pieces to the unit.
XP recognized it on four computers so far with no problems.

Dig is nice and fast.
Then, i see them on mTV, okay, now everyone likes them.
Its horrible.
Whats a good song?
wtf?
these guys are pure noise.
Bad CD, save your money for Spineshank.
Dig, because its the only one you've heard and you dont know a thing about music.
The rest is slow, and copying off tool.
Songs like Prod, Everything and Nothing, Cradle suck.
Call these guys original?
they rip off of Tool and Slipknot.
So you buy the CD so it makes you look cool, only problem, when everyone has it, its WONT make you look cool.
Okay.
A great up coming band.
the only songs that are actually in the style of Dig are Internal Primates Forever, and Under My Skin.
and not to mention 5 of the tracks are fillers.
Bad.

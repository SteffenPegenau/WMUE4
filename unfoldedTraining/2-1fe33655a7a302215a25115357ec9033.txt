What the hell is that about?
What was 50 smoking?
Then he sings with Dre and you think it would be a classic, wrong.
Then a duet with Justin Timberlake?
Robin Thicke?
Its repetitive and boring.
The first four songs are really good, surprised me.
A very embarrassing and forgettable song by two good artist.
I dont know why maybe because they made a movie about his life or MTV plays only the sugar coated, teen friendly songs he sings.
Are you friggin kidding me?
Then Nicole Scherzinger duet?
The first four songs are good but the bubblegum hip pop duets are stupid.
Thats when he does his best work.
Talk about a gangster.
I cant believe that I bought this cd.
Then a few good songs then a duet with Eminem.
Skip.
Cd is a mixed bag, he should sing solo.
I never liked 50 cent.
The rest of tracks are alright but nothing stands out.

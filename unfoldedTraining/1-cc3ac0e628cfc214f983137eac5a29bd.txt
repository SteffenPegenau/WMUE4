So I returned it for the 56400.
After several minutes, most of the ice cubes were still just that - cubes and and although the yogurt did blend with the raspberries, there were still some whole strawberries!
I used a spatula (once the blades stopped, of course).
I used a straw to suck up whatever I could, cleaned it and returned it.
He encouraged me to try it out and return it if I wasn't satisfied.
Nothing!
The salesperson suggested I go with the 14 speed Hamilton Beach, as it is inexpensive and popular.
I waited and waited.
Wanting to make smoothies, and knowing nothing about blenders, I did some research online and asked for help from a houseware store that I shop at frequently.
I used a spoon.
Although it made a lot of noise, nothing was happening!
Once I added my yogurt, fruit and ice cubes, I turned the 56400 on.
Now I'm in the market for a blender once again.
I wasn't (I realized I wanted to be able to crush ice with without having to add liquid.)
I sure could use a margarita!

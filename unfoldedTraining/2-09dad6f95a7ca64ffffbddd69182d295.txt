I don't know.
I gave this book 2 stars, because it's a book.
It also is, frankly, irrelevent.
You really don't know what you're reading.
This is a hard book to comment on.
As they exist to her.
Is the writer writing this as a vehicle for poilital persuaion and advancement?
All books have some merit, good or bad.
The main failing of the book is the delusion of the writer, as the real living history has proven.
Is the writer trying to include us in a world that we aren't involved in and situations that we aren't privy to?
The point of the book is questionable.
This is how the writer sees situations as they exist.
No one really knows.
Too much manipulation in the past gives the writer no credibility.
I really think the book is a waste of time, because of the reputation of the writer.
The author is not really an author, so the writing is flat and incoherent.

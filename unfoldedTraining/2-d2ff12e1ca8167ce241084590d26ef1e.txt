I had to take it to a person to cut the elastic and re-sew the arms just to fit my 2 year old.
This won't fit my 3 year old at all.
This costume is very cute but I was disappointed for many reasons.
The workmanship is very poor also.
The seams around the crotch area are all crooked.
The arm holes are VERY small and tight.
The size is VERY small.
The skirt is definitely not as long and full as the picture shows.
Definitely not top-notch product here.
It will fit my 2 year old.
It's fine for dress-up around the house.
We did fluff it up after shipping, stretched out the tulle, but still no where as shown on the picture.
Probably would have helped me decide on what size to buy.
Sizing on the packaging would have been helpful if it was listed on the amazon listing.
I don't know what 3 or 4 year old could have worn it.

Want a real taste of Real Gypsy violin playing???
More importantly, he imported the great Gypsy Violinist - Stephane Grappelli.
SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
Ahh... Music at it's best!!!
Grappelli's performance is awesome.
Grappelli and O'Connor play twin fiddles on Tiger Rag.
;-)
!Also note that shortly after the film Grappelli & Grisman teamed up for a live album on Warner Brothers.
In the movie he performs with several members of his quintet/quartet.
It should not be missed!!
Grappelli is the noted violinst who performed in the 1930s and perhaps into the 40s with the legendary Jazz guitarist - Django Reinhardt.
All the other reviews here talk about the story of the film.
It may be out of print now.
I enjoy that as well, but what they miss is the music.
Hidden in this film treasure is a sound track scored by Mandolinist David Grisman.
It also features musical greats Mike Marshall and Mark O'Connor.

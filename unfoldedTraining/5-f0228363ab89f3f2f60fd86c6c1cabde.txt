It would have to be between Wait and Bleed, No Life, Diluted, or Scissors.
Slipknot is the BEST band there is out there, and always will be.
I just think he has a great and amazing voice.
They just definetly know how to play.
Where do I start?
They sing about the craziest stuff.
The vidoes are so interesting to watch because you never know what they're going to do next.
There lyrics are also exciting.
I listen to them at least 3-4 hours a day.
I am a total Slipknot fanatic and they are the only band I listen to, except a few others.
Yeah, they might be a little scary looking, but thats one of the things I love about them.
Even though I am totally obsessed with all nine guys, I would have to say my favorite is the lead singer, Corey Taylor.
All of there album's are great.
They make Limp Bizkit look like a little sissy, girlie band.
This CD absolutely blows you away.
I love all of the songs, but I don't know which is my favorite.
Wow!
How there so crazy and outgoing.

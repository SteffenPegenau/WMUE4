Unbeleivable.
It will grip the shank like a vise.
This saw kicks hiney!
I liked it so much, I bought 5 more so we would never be short on the job.
You can't imagine how useful it is until you have one in your hand.
The saw is great.
S0 fast and easy to use.
Those old Japanese woodworkers really know their stuff.It doesn't matter if it's a fine cut or a rough cut.
It pales into insignificance next to the prybar!
Better get a bunch because your friends will want one too!
I love this tool!
It makes a fine scraper for everything from glue to paint to concrete.
Both sizes are perfect.
We all know they outperform all other hand saws.
But you know what ?
The tip is so sharp you can easily slip it in behind delicate trim for easy removal.
All my other pry bars are gathering dust.
The claw is so sharp that you don't even need a head to pull a nail with it.
The design is much like the exhumer, but the other end is much more useful.

You simply cannot last in the music industry by being stagnant.
48 minutes is a little short for a CD these days.
(Fill her up) Buy the CD, play it and enjoy it.
Stop complaining that it doesn't sound like your favorite Sting CD.
Who else in pop music today can capture the essence of country and gospel in the same song?
People need to stop comparing this CD to their other Sting "favorites."
Sting has truly evolved from the time I saw him in concert in Houston, Texas in 1982.
It's simply not fair.
Look how much the Beatles evolved over time.
Sting is doing just that.
It's like comparing one of your children to the others.
Sting is moving on, let's join him for the ride.
However, in the case of this CD it is the quality and not the quantity that counts.
We as fans must evolve as well.
A reincarnation of Regatta de Blanc wouldn't cut it today.

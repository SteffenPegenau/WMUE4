I WOULD HAVE GIVENTHIS CD 5 STARS, BUT, THE ORCHESTRA THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR, ISNOT HERE ...
.
!
.
The search go's on .
THEY HAVEPUT IN HARRY JAMES' VERSIONON THE CD.
By the way,VIVA' UPPER-CASE LETTERS !
BUT,"SEPTEMBER SONG" FROM;"THE JOE BUSHKIN STORY" CD IS NOT THE VERSION FROM THIS MOVIE.P.S.
!
THIS IS BOGUS.
I SHOULD SAY, THE MYSTERY ORCHESTRA.
IT'S GREAT OLD TIMECLASSIC AMERICAN MUSIC FROM SOME OF HIS MOVIES.
THE MUSIC (26 TRACKS) ARE FROM 1927 TO 1949.
THE ORCHESTRA THAT PLAYS,"SEPTEMBER SONG" IS NOT HERE!
JOE BUSHKIN PLAYS IN THE LOWER REGISTEROF THE PIANO.

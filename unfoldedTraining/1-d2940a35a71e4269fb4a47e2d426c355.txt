No one is ever there.
Their hours are 9:00am - 9:00pm EST.
I get home about 7:25 pm.
I want to spend time with them.
I have to restart my computer and reflash modem every time my computer goes to sleep to make the modem work.Tech support is terrible.
That means if there is a problem, I have 35 minutes to try to get a hold of someone.
if it were possible, I would give it zero stars.
I work 7am-7pm (CST) mon thru friday.
I bought this modem 48 hours ago and plan on returning it.
I have a family.
I should be able to deal with my modem on my time.
SOMEBODY IN INDIA IS BETTER THAN NOBODY.
If I am paying for the call (that's right it is NOT 1-800) and I paid good money for the product, My modem's company should not dictate when I have to get a hold of them.
Auto configure DOES NOT WORK.
Plan on it taking about 30 mminutes to self set up if you already have your pertinent info (VCI, VPI, and Encapsulation).

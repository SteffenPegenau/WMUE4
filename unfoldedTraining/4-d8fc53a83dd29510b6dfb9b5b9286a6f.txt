I initially was put on to this author by a friend who visited from Canada.
The Griffin books keep reintroducing the same characters, a technique which made me feel that I was staying tuned in to old friends.
He is a Canadian Army Officer.
I read the story on my Kindle Fire.
.
I was in Army Aviation on the tail end of the Korean War .
I am just finishing the Captains .
Griffin is very accurate in these historically-oriented novels.
Because of the enjoyment, I have purchased three additional books by W.E.B.
Griffin.
excuse the mistake, "the Korean Police Action."
this book did not have the impact as the others, although it did tell the remarkable experience of "The Duke."
When I read the Aviators by Griffin; it brought back many memories.
.
The other two of the four books I read are the Generals and the Majors.I intend to order another later tonight.Respectfully, a very satisfied and grateful reader.

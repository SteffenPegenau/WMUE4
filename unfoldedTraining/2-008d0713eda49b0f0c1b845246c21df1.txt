My complaints about this machine are many.
The dust chute (which you have to pay extra for) gets in the way and one has to flip it around everytime you need the collector on the other side.
I'm not sure why all of the trade magazines gave it such a high review.
Poor dust collection.
I bought this planer over a year ago after a lot of research and decided it must be worth the extra cost.
So after a year of frustration I bought a Dewalt DW735.
Lastly the "blade zero" switch is not accurate.
I have it hooked up to a jet 1,100 cfm collector and still get a fair amount of debri.
Now this machine is worth the money.
It is really too bad that delta has really gone down hill in the last few years.
Hope they can step it up.
This planer is a sure winner.
The two speeds are a gimick.
I love it.
The knives do not last very long and are prone to little chips.
There appears to me to be no difference in the quality of cut.

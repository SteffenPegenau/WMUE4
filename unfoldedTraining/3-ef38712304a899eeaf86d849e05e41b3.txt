WRONG.
If you don't read the book more then likely you wouldn't understand the movie though.
This movie is a good example of why you can't make a 600 page book into a two hour movie.
Even though i found many differences between the book and dvd.
The actors do do a very good job in the movie and Robin Williams was incredibly.
The book was an incredible piece of literature and this movie came no where close.
I won't say what happens, but thats just my opinion.
Read the book, much better then the movie.
Right?
FOr instance, I found the end very dissapointing.
I'm in the 11th grade and I just read the book and i thought that it was incredible.
If you want a real treat, read the book.
I figured maybe if the book was so good then the movie would be good.
Compared the book, I thought this movie was trash.
The movie on its own was ok.
I felt there were many scenes were dissappointing.

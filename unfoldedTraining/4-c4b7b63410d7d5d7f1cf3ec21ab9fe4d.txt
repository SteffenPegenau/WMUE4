Usually that means, theirs more in it.
But, I can't tell what's different.
I mean i enjoyed it, but wasen't quit what I thought it would be.
I liked House of 1000 corpses, better.
Because you laugh more than you do anything else.
I was like, that's it?
I must not remember the movie to well.
Then when it came out on dvd.
For some reasone, it just gets better the more I watch it.
This movie is not a horror movie.
I went out and bought it.
When I saw it in the movie theater.
Then what you saw in the theater.
Good movie!
I got the unrated version.
So, it's great!
It's more of a violent comedy.

too bad.
only went through 2 sets of batteries.stopped working suddenly.
only used 10-12 times.
paid $50.00 for the toy.
never dropped.
she loved playing her own music.
really fun for my granddaughter.
she loved it so much that i am risking buying another one but i am keeping the packaging.
grandbaby loved it.
very unhappy.
only played with it one night a week.
it was easy for her to use and worked well in every respect.
well designed even had volume control.really fun with two working microphones.
didn't last a year.
i'll write back about how long this one lasts.Sing Along CD Player
this toy was at grandma's house and did not see much use.
supposedly designed especially for young children.
the disc would spin and them shut off without playing.

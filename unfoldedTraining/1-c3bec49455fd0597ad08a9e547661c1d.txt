And they require you to use two boards!!
It tells you what birds like bird houses.
There is only ONE plan.
I bought this book based on the Stokes name and reputation.
All things that are much better explained in other books.Do yourself a favour.
Wow.
Or, since you can always return it, buy t and see how pathetic it is for yourself.
What a disappointment.
This book only includes ONE plan.
Don't buy this book.
The rest of the book is fluff.
!Let me say it again.
Bad move.
I've read a number of books on building bird houses, and I've built dozens of them myself.
It's the standard "single board bird house" design.
This book was so incredibly bad, it's hard to imagine.
It tells you other types of houses that you can make (if you go out and buy a real book), and it tells you a little about the birds.

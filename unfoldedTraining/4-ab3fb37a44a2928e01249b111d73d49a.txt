I could not believe how good they sound and how much road noise they block out.
I guess Im lucky.
All other headphones have to have the bass almost maxed out.
These buds rock!!!
I used the foam plugs that fit my ears best and have had no trouble.
I have read where others have to readjust them to get them to fit correctly.
I would have to listen with the volume at max at not be able to hear very well, but I would be able to hear.
I use to use a pair of behind the ear clip on headphones.
I love them.
I now use them when I run, ride, or just am hanging out.
They are well worth the 14 bucks
What suprised me the most was the amount of bass that these little buds kick out.
I can listen with the volume turned down to half.
I bought a pair of these headphones in the hopes of being able to listen to music/news while riding my motorcycle.
I had to turn the settings for bass down to get it to sound right to me.

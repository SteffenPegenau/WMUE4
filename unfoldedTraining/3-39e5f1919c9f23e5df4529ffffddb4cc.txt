This movies tries too hard to be scary at the wrong moments.
It throws you into a nightmare before you really have a chance to care about any of the characters.
And somehow manages to be somewhat powerful.
Great line.
Unfortunately, that's the scariest part of this movie, where and how it takes place.
It does happen along the way towards the end though.
But in the end, turns out to be a decent story.
This was a cryptic but entertaining ride, one that's worth seeing.
The idea (for me about watching movies) is to escape reality for a while, and this sure took me away (to a place I wouldn't want to be for too long).
It could've been so good (if it weren't for the many unanswered questions and plot holes).
Near the end you kind of have a feeling what might happen (even if you can't quite predict exactly how).
"You can't trust someone who thinks you're crazy."
But it seemed to be lacking something.
This stayed with me a while after seeing it.
What a spooky setting.

The moves look like nothing ive seen today.
I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone who's 20 like myself or older.
Her moves are stuck in the 1980's.
OVER ALL .... NOT A GOOD DVD.
I expected Rap music ,not techo.
it didn't make sense.
She also teaches way too fast.
1st off you called this "hip-hop".
get QUICK FIX -CARDIO KICK ( KICKBOXING).
She shows you once and then adds more to it.
The music is out there too.
From what i saw i didn't like this workout at all !.
I happened to see one of the segments from this dvd on Exersice TV on digtial cable.
The only people who like this dvd are people who are stuck in the 80's or maybe pre-teens.
If you want people to learn you have to show us at least 3or 4 times.
THAT DVD IS MUCH BETTER.

Milkweed is a book by Jerry Spinelli.
He can steal realy well.
The kid finds an older kid named Uri.
Because I am not going to tell you his name.
The kid lives with Uri under a barber shop.
Uri tries to tell him that he should not want to be a Nazi.
BAD!
The kid says he wants to be a Nazi when he grows up.
You might not know Jerry Spinelli, but he is a realy good author.
Milkweed is a book about the time when the Nazis are taking over.
So read the book to find out.
I know I am probably aggravating you with this kid stuff.
The kid finds out he is a gypsy instead of a Jew.
Uri has no parents either.
It is about a kid who lost his parents by the age of 3.
The kid becomes a pro stealer.

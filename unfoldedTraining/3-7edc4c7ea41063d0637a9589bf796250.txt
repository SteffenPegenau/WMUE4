If you like the old Korn music, this isn't for you, but if you like their newer image and music, it's pretty good.
Hollow Life- 9/105.
Blame- 9/104.
It's my least-favorite though.1.
Alone I Break- 9/1010.
Here to Stay- 10/102.
If you like hard but slower metal, this is easily the best album for you.
Beat It Upright- 4/1012.
Some of their great new songs are in this album, but only a few.
Bottled Up Inside- 8/106.
Only half of the album is great, some of the others are good, and then several are just not good at all.
Thoughtless- 10/107.
But if you like their older music, this probably their worst.
Embrace- 5/1011.
Make Believe- 9/103.
No One's There- 10/10
I'm Hiding- 8/1014.
Hating- 7.5/108.
One More Time- 8/109.
Wake Up Hate- 2/1013.

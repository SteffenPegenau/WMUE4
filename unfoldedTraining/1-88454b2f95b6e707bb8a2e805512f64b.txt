Wouldn't make any money would you, Redfield.
Every reviewer who ripped on this book are exactly right!
Do not WASTE your MONEY!
!
Their writing must be just as bad.
ANY high school English teacher would have MADE you rewrite this book with characters that have DEPTH and a PLOT.
If your "insights" are so damn important why didn't you write them down in some fancy brochure and mail them out?
Come on, Redfield!
I REPEAT, DO NOT!
Although you (Redfield) could have wrote the insights down on ONE PIECE OF PAPER and stood on the corner handing them out.
And who are the editors who "okayed" this book?
HERE'S AN INSIGHT TO ALL POTENTIAL BUYERS OF THIS BOOK >>> DO NOT!
And on top of all this there is a tenth insight?!?!
I hope they make a time machine before I die so I can go back in time and PREVENT Redfield from writing this book.
<<.
This was supposed to be a story, RIGHT?
Granted the "insights" have some interest I suppose.

Slayer is the greatest character in this book.
If he wasn't killed, he could have easily destroyed the kingdom of Phlan.
And oh my goodness, I love the part when Sirana goes "Here, let me help you, little sister."
And, Not only that, he could've been the ruler of the world.
He's a character that would have changed the whole world if he hadn't been killed by Sirana, that devil.
When I read pages 50 and 51, I was soooo outraged when Slayer dies.
Oh my goodness, I totally love the part when Kern goes "Begone, spirit of evil."
After all, that is my last name.
I'm sure a real ghost would jump and run at that!".
and Listle goes "'Begone, spirit of evil!
Oh my goodness.
Other than all of that, the book was hilarious!
Oh, that was great, Kern!
Oh my goodness, I've got the giggles just writing that.
and Listle thinks to herself: I'm not your little sister!
I can't believe he dies.
Come on.
That would have changed the whole entire book.

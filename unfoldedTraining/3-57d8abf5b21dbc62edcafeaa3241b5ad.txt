This set is very surprising.
Though a handful of tracks seriously do not belong, the rest fit together to perform a true and solid rock album.1) Confessions- Deep, but not original.
6/10.10) Edge Of 17- Though not as good as the original, it is very dazzling.
6/10.9) Fastlane- Just okay.
8/10.3) I Live For...- Slick and edgy.
9/10.11) Who Loves You- Does not fit; but okay.
6/10.12) La Bella Vista- Good, but plain.
8/10.4) I Want You...- Does not fit; very strange.
7/10.82/120 - 68%: ***
7/10.8) If You Were Me- A little strange, but okay.
8/10.6) A Little...- Does not fit, but good.
I expected the 'my childhood was horrible' portion (I am not bashing this topic, but singers do not have to belt it out in a song), but I surely did not expect such a solid album from Lohan.
7/10.2) Black Hole- Grungy and light at the same time.
4/10.5) My Innocence- Moving and light.
6/10.7) If It's Alright- Good, but a little boring.

I just had to pay for tax because I live in Florida.
I was so impressed with this TV that I got rid of my 51" Sony HD downstairs and purchased a new 56" Samsung DLP TV.
It's not that big of a deal because it's just for the bedroom, but if it was my main TV downstairs, it would almost have to have a surround sound system hooked up to it.
It was replacing a 36" Phillips HDTV.
I was watching basketball on ESPN HD and thought I was looking into a window and I don't even care about the NBA, it's just amazing.
The picture is out of this world.
So true.
Just like that little girl with the elephant says "It's the mirrors."
I bought this TV for my bedroom upstairs.
The audio though is a little weak.
The TV weighs less than the 36" one.
Free shipping.
They contacted me a couple of days before coming out and they were there when they said they would be.
No problem with the delivery.
I got this TV for about $800 from Amazon through TigerDirect.

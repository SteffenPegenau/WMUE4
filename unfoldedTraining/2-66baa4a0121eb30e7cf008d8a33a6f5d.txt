Just silly.
God, I hope this isn't "The" book on calculus on manifolds.
I guess it was tough proof reading a hundred pages with 10 sentences on each page.
What a dis-service to the subject.
A Font so small that indices are lost on some equations.
Mulitvariable calculus in a book that is only 5 inches across?
It can barely contain the full definitions for tensor products.
It is no Differential Geometry.
Not at all the quality you would expect from this author.
It seems to be a bunch of class notes cobbled together.
Lacking examples or much of anything for the reader to bridge the gap his terse prose leaves.
It's format is so concise as to be practically useless.
The difficulty is not within the subject matter, but with it's meager presentation.
I never knew that f(a)= f(a)+ f'(a)*h...oh wait it isn't, but f(a+h) is!
What a bunch of hype on this book.
Not to mention the typos.
Get the cheapest version you can.

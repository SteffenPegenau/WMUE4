I am very disappointed.
ARGH!
~ a little here, a little there.
I received Sacred Treasures 11 some time ago and of all the others (ST3,4,5,1) this was the best.
There was a passage (which was unmistakeable) where the basses sounded like the Australian "didgeridoo"??
This is not a shadow of the other!
~ I don't have my spellcheck.
I cannot find my copy, so I ordered another one.
Can someone identify the Sacred Treasure this one is?
Was I wrong or mistaken?
The cornets dominate, very LITTLE choral, and there were some unmistakable very low bass voices in the first one.
if someone knows, email me.
It is NOT the same!
(where is the CHORAL?
In short, it was magnificent.

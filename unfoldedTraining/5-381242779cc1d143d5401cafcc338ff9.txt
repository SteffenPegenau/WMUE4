Everyone was "Oh, it's all gross!"
My favorite part was when Paul was stuck in the shell-hole with the French solider he killed.
Maybe if they read it they would.
Wow, that was gutwrenching.
Of course it is!
I don't think it was too gross to show.
How else do you think it's going to be?
I'm a fourteen year old girl and I like shopping and dressing up and writing and poetry but I definitely still got something from this book that a lot of kids in my school didn't seem to get.
It's showing you war.
I felt really weird, because I thought it was awesome.
I think about three of us actually read it.
This is wonderful.
It made me cry.
My Freshman English class read this book about three months ago.
And the other two were complaining about it savagely.

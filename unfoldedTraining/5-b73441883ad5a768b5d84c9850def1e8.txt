Really?
The furminator pulls out so much loose fur it's amazing!
Without a doubt.
Slicker brushes just weren't up to the task.I saw a gadget on TV (not the furminator) and decided to see if I could find something that worked.
But the reviews were stellar so I decided to give it a go.Simply put: best pet grooming product ever!
That much for a brush?
If you have a dog that sheds, you need to have this item.
I initially balked at the price.
I was able to pick this up for $32 last fall from Amazon.com, and it was some of the best money I ever spent.
One has fairly long fur for a Lab and sheds pretty much constantly.
The other sheds like mad for a few weeks a couple times a year.
There are two Labs in our family.
win-win!
And they like it because they don't have to be brushed so often with a harsh wire brush.
After reading poor reviews of said gadget, someone recommended the furminator.

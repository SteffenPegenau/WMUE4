Let this hairball ride on out of town.
We don't need Walter Mitty's inventing such nonsense.
Important work, but the NSA has nothing at all to do with the kinds of things Perkins describes.
I suppose the CIA was too old hat for you.
For the information of everybody out there, the NSA is the electronic intellgience and code-breaking arm of the U.S. intelligence community.
The book is rubbish.
Geeks with earphones and computer nerds.
John Perkins is a complete fraud.
Worked for the National Security Agency, did you?
He is a typical gringo goofball who drifted down to Latin America (in this case, Ecuador) and picked up some half-baked nonsense from some leftist books.
Want to know what Perkins is?
He then got the bright idea of inventing his life of darring-do and selling it.
The USG and the big banks do enough dirty work.
Sure.
To All:Do not buy this book.
You find these lost souls all over the place in South America, Central America, and Mexico.
Whew!

Overall this seems to be a good quality copy.
The colors are dull and blurry.
Again this is an engaging, interesting story(with Wayne starting as a bad seed).Overall I would stay away, unless you want a good copy of Blue Steel.
This movie is unwatchable.Having said all this, there is another DVD in this two pack.
There are a few frames that are washed out and murky.
The story is engaging.Hell Town is Blue Steel's opposite.
I bought this by mistake.
It's pan and scan and a bad transfer to boot.
I'd say about 95% is crisp.
On it are Blue Steel and Hell Town(or Born to the west).
The image is dull and murky, but the sound does not have alot of hiss.
Having watched both, I have a new respect for John Wayne as an actor.The image on Blue Steel is very good.
For example, Wayne rides a white horse that is a vibrant white.
This copy of Mclintock is terrible.
There is alot of hissing and dropout.
The sound on this copy though isn't good.
I had never seen an early John Wayne movie.

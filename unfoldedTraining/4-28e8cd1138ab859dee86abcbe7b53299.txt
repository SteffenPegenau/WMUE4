Watch the movie.
The acting, directing, and writing were well executed.
Here we have a child ignored by his parents, and loved by a succession of nannies who abandon him.
It's a really interesting piece, but not my favorite movie ever made.
Other reviewers found this movie trite.
I might watch it again, but probably with someone else.
It isn't a touching story about how someone without hope overcomes the odds.
Perhaps the difficulties wealthy white New Yorkers face isn't profound enough social commentary for some.
That's the point.
I thought it was great.
The best thing, though, is the window it gives into the upbringing of the upper classes.
It might tell you why those folks seem so hopeless in the first place, though.I've given it four stars to be picky.
Of course, you might come away with some sympathy for the devil.
Paul Giamatti was especially good.
Why are those who've been given everything for nothing often arrogant, distant, and unhappy?

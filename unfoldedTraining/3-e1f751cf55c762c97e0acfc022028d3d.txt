They are supposed to be bad.
Not a well known Stanwyck movie but it's worth it just for her.
Nothing average about Stanwyck's acting.
Barbara Stanwyck is Dixie Daisy, the headlining lady at the old opera theatre, turned burlesque house.
For obvious reasons.
This movie stalls in several places as some really bad vadvillians get to do their bits.
Dixie is the main suspect & she has motive.
She is the only performer in this with a better than average performance.
She gets the close-ups & plenty of face time in this mediocre murder mystery.
Back stage scenes are fun but not particularly inspiring.
They are strangled by their own G-Strings.
That apparently is part of the charm.
Dixie has competition from other "ladies" who resent her recent stardom.
The actual murderer becomes quite evident & you will know that moment when you see it.
Everybody is aspiring to move up to the big time.

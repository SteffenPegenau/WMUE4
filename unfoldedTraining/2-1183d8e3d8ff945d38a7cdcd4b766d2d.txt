They make me want to laugh, if anything.
Plus, this CD has a much greater Christian undertone than any of the other wannabes, which repels me quite a bit.
There is nothing unique about them.
The music is pretty bad, especially the cheesy wailing electric guitars.
Or nothing good.
The lyrics are so ridiculously cheesy, too.
I wasn't expecting much in the first place after having bought CDs like Era and Industrial Monk ages ago and pretty much loathing them.
I do like the chants on "Mystic Spirit Voices," but that's it.
Enigma's lyrics are deep, original, and heartfelt.
'Nuff said.
And the English vocals...AWFUL!
These people are not the prophets they think they are.
These are not.
All of these groups ARE cheap imitations of great bands like Enigma and Delerium.
They got some woman to try to sound like Sandra, the main Enigma vocalist, making them even more of a cheap imitation of the King.

Makes a similar noise between subsequent pages.
You can hear the motor and the rollers as it spits out each page.
This can easily be corrected by switching to a higher quality setting.
With black & white text in draft mode, the text is good... clear and sharp.
Photos are pretty awesome.
Makes a loud whirring noise when beginning a printout.
But between pages, it's kinda noisey.
It is quiet as it is actually printing.
Text quality is fine in spite of what some people have said.
So, I can't make a judgement on other papers.
4 x 6's look like they came from a lab.
I have only used Canon photo paper for photos.
May not be the quietest printer around.
In fact, the text can be rather jagged.
But any "colored" text or text imbeded within color graphics is not as sharp in draft mode.
But for the price, it would be hard to beat the i850.

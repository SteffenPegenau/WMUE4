NOTHING sounds original with this "band"!1.
...
Wouldn't want it too heavy or it'll hurt everyone's ears!2.
Add in a rapper(make sure he's white), and a DJ(who has no idea what he's doing)3.
It did sell a lot of records you know.
Who can sell the most.
Not TOO heavy.
And I'd like to thank my mom and dad and...")4.
Now I hate everything!

Get a singer who has a lot of "angst", and have him write songs about his horrible childhood.

This band'll disappear.
Oh!

Throw in distorted guitars.
The singer sounds like a member of N'Sync!But of course, this band will probably win a Grammy sometime or another.
After all, that's all the Grammy awards pay attention to.

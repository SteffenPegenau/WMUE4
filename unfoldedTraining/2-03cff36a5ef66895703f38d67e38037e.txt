If you like gospel music you may like this cd.
My favorites on the cd are 'Cry' and 'Beautiful' after that it is a very mediocre cd in my opinion.
I became a fan of hers first because of the music she made.
As much as I like her as a person I really didn't care for this cd.
The song 'Cry' is one of the faster songs on the cd.
You basically get a cd of a bunch of songs that sound like 'When the Lights Go Down'.
And in my opinion it's not even a good song.
On her cd's she had some uptempo and slower songs.
Is that a fast song?
And for what used to be an automatic purchase (buying a Faith Hill cd) I will have to listen with caution in the future.
I am sure by now most of you have heard 'When the Lights Go Down'.
And the song in my opinion sounded too similar to 'There You'll Be'.
I have been a big Faith's and really still am.
The only uptempo song on this cd is the first one on the cd - 'Free'.
It was country music than turned me onto her music.
This new cd is mostly slower tempo songs.

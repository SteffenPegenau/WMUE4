Spectacular.
I was going to buy it really soon, but guess what, I found it in a parking lot, in perfect condition.
Shazam!!!
Don't be discouraged by the first 2 or 3 songs, even though they're great.
Give it a couple listens.
"The Good Life", "El Scorcho", "Pink Triangle", "Falling For You", "Butterfly".
This album really grows on you.
This album starts to be great at "Across The Sea", which is about Rivers Cuomo's obsession with a Japanese fan that wrote him a letter.
Extraordinary.
!
What makes this even sweeter, is that it is great.
Rivers Cuomo is genius.WARNING: Do Not Expect What You Heard on Blue Album.
Rivers Cuomo, the only rockstar to dislike groupies.
This is a great album.
Happy listening!!
Jesus, this is great.
This is completely different, yet better.

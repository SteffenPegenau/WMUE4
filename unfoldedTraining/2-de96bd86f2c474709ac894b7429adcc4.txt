You'd think for the price you pay for them, there'd be sturdier concstruction an active lifestyle.
HATED IT!!
I love the sound.
The construction?
Overall my rating is 5 stars for sound and 2 for construction.
What can I say?
In my case it was always the right plug.
The connection where the plug meets the cord allows for too much movement at the joint hense the wire connection breaks inside the insulation.
Every single pair died within a few months of purchase.
I bought the Bling-bling Black.
This is my 5th pair of headphones in less than a year.
and hold up to V-Moda really needs to rethink this design flaw.
Results either the right or left plug stops working or both.
Where the cord comes out of the plug is the major weak spot and is not compatible with an active lifestyle.
Crisp clear highs and midrange and the low deep rich bass.

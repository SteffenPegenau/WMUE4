1) Gender determinism.
I wish I hadn't revisited it and it had remained a pleasant memory.
Certain issues about the series struck me.
Some pretty disgusting language is used to describe homosexuality.
While Card is weakly in favor of equality, he clearly feels that women are "naturally" going to serve certain roles and men will "naturally" fill other roles.
Coloring all of this is my adult understanding of Card's religious background.
Also, fair warning to parents, you might want to consider the negative messages in these books before giving them to children or at least talking over these issues with young readers.
Overall, the series is ruined for me.
But...in the larger context of our world, its really, really regrettable.
I read this series as a child and really enjoyed It.
Gross.
On the one hand, if viewed simply in the context of the story and the characters, maybe Card can get a pass.
I recently revisited it as an adult.
3) Arranged marriage of young girls.
2) Homophobia.

A piece of junk.
This machine is made by Home Ease.
It gave me a lot of stresses and headaches.
I brought it to Radio Shack to purchase the a/c adaptor and still not work.
So that I did not return it and I threw in the dumpster.
He said that only return my money for the cost of the product no shipping cost.
Then I have to pay the shipping to return the product.
The machine can not turn on.
I installed the battery and is no power.
A piece of junk.
I contact the seller.
No power supply go in.
I have try so many hours and methods to make it work.
It's painful.
So instead of I already lost $11.00 Now I would loose $16.00.
Still no power.
I'm thinking may be Home Ease the manufacturer put the battery directions wrong so I try 20 different ways to put the battery.
This product is not deserve one star since we don't have one star on the review :(

Of course, in this day and age, that could be considered musical suicide.
I mean, who wants to hear something new?
Tony, yes, but "Tommy"?
Yes, they try to pull of the whole goth/punk/emo rock look.
Most certainly not.
And write in a manner consistent with that of an elementary age student.
I just find it to be a bit humorous how other people can give such a straight forward review, and be such total idiots at the same time.
The music I'll admit is catchy but a little too repetitive.
Nevertheless, this band doesn't do much to stand out from the crowd.
Yes, they sound like My Chemical Ramance... kind of.
Only me...
That being just one.
I mean, who in the world is "Tommy Brummel"?
I sure as heck have never heard of him.
Or maybe the point was to be a joke.
I just can't take a review seriously if it has misconstrued major facts.
I don't particularly have feelings leaning one way or another towards this band.
Who cares...?

well done.
the license plate was an awesome addition.
for $90.
i got this before my reserve copy from gamestop so i ended up giving my reserve copy to a friend.
even as good as this game is.
surely there's better ways to learn how to run drugs, pimp hoes, and kill cops.
thanks amazon.
and new.
nicely packaged.
i wonder how many pedestrians u.p.s.
ran over to get it to me... i'm still laughing at the idiots on ebay or craigslist paying $100 or so when they could just get it from amazon.
i also appreciated the fact i was able to order this for $90 the day before release and get it upon waking up on the official release date.
after playing gta4, even after the months that will go by, i still don't think i'll last more then 10 minutes if i start killing cops in the real world.
with the license plate.
that said, the amazon pre-order was worth it.
i'm not the best gamer in the world but i just have to say glenn beck is an idiot.

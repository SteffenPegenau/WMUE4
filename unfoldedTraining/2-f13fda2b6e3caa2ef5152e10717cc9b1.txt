7/10.7) Reflections- Deep and emotional.
The few shining tracks are "Lead The Way," "Reflections," and "Never Too Far.
7/10.74/120- 62%: **1/2
6/10.10) Never Too Far- Great love ballad.
This is rock-bottom.
8/10.8) Last Night...- Boring, and again 'cheesy.'
Since "Butterfly" (not including it), Mariah's albums have gone downhill.
"1) Loverboy- Awful chorus and too many collaborators, but catchy.
2/10.6) All My Life- Just good.
4/10.9) Want You- Decent, but too plain at times.
8/10.3) If We- Good upbeat song.
As a true fan of Careys, "Glitter" is extremely disappointing.
7/10.12) Loverboy- Much better when excluding the many collaborators.
Collaboration not too bad.
After so many amazing albums (all until "Rainbow"), what has happened to her music?
7/10.4) ...Turn You On- One of the two 'cheesy' disco renditions.
5/10.2) Lead The Way- Good and soft ballad.
8/10.11) Twister- Good, but repetitive.
5/10.5) Don't Stop- Aboslutely awful and horrible.

I guess people really expect different things from a book.
I logged on to read the reviews out of curiosity and am bewildered by what I find.
Secondly, the stories are told in the best classical tradition that is as entertaining as a story by the campfire.
It seems very reasonable to me.
Unnecessary vulgarity?
To boot, there are many ideas in the book which I personally found to be thought-provoking.
I am amazed at the negative comments some readers have.
Thirdly, the characters are interesting.
Seems like it's either love or hate for the book.
Too boring to finish?
I'm in the "love it" camp, although I am only half-way through the story and haven't had the chance to experience the much discussed ending.
It's been a comfort to my spirit to read Inman and Ada's journeys.
Too violent?
I have, however, enjoyed EVERY PAGE so far.
The descriptions of the surroundings are so crisp that one feels as if one were truly present.

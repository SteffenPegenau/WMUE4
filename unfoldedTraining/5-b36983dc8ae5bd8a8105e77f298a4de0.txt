This is an intelligent movie for people who appreciate a feast, and after, you're left with dessert.
Wow!
Long after you leave it, the plot twists and "what ifs" spin around in your head.
Great screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie.
Brilliant.Fine performances from all involved, especially Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne and Director Bryan Singer.
It's one on the best films ever made.
"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."
I must confess, I put off seeing this film for sometime, just because of the title.
None of it happened.
To have missed this one would have been such a great loss indeed.
When someone finally lent me a copy during a spare moment, I reluctantly watched it.
What a great film.
It's a game played well.
It's also a film that stays with you.
The finest line from the film sums it all up.
Great fodder for debate.
And finally if you think about it, you get it.

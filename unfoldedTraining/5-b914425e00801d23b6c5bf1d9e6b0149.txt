Then I got an email about the dangers of re-using plastic water bottles.
Getting my 8 year old son ready for school had become a full time job.
I threw out my plastic water bottle and began using a Klean Kanteen.
I bought my son the 18 oz size to bring to school and camp.
3 months ago, I was on the verge of being tested for MS.
By 10am I was shot.
The email suggested using glass or stainless steel.
I figured it was worth a try.
I love the Klean Kanteen!
I woke each day in intense pain in my arms, legs, neck and back.
Its worth every penny.
I barely slept and at 48 thought my life was over.
In less than 4 days I had my life back.
Its durable, looks great, and SAFE!
As I had done all my life, I was drinking about 80 oz of water a day, and was using a large brown plastic Arizona Iced Tea bottle as my water bottle.

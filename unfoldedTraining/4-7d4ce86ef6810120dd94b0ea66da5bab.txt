So many questions, some answered.
One wonders if she had gone to a doctor as a teen, her condition could have been altered.
As a wee child, I wanted to be the Tammi Terrell that I saw on my aunt's album cover.
All in all, I enjoyed the book and it stays on my mind.
This is an easy read and I found myself crying at the end.
The photos could have been better.
Since this is the only book I've seen about her, I have nothing to compare it to.
Sorry.
By the way, I downloaded Tammi and Marvin's songs.
Actually, no one she interviewed did.
I did find myself disgusted by James Brown and David Ruffin, men who felt that need to beat Tammi.
It was Tammi as the main vocalist, not Valarie.
The sister does get some years mixed up and doesn't know an awful lot about her sister's life.
Decent book.
As a musician, I know the difference.

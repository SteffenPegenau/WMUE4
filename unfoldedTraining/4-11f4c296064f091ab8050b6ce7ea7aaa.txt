It has shown how Harry has changed and now has the courage to confront his uncle.
This particular book shows us a lot problems that actual teens go through.
The movie was good but, not that much information was shown.
A lot of the details were missing and important ones too.
The third novel of Harry's series there was way different than the first two.
Of all three books so far this one is the best.
People loose someone they love: Harry, Ron, and Hermione thought htey had lost Buckbeak forever.
I would say that this book was way better than the second.
There was no Voldemort for Harry to face and there was more excitement and more adventures in the book.
It shows when friends fight with each other or have an arguement and then make up; like Ron and Hermione.
Just that it was a good book.
oK.
It has a lot of sympathy.
overall both third book and movie were good.
So I'm not telling you read the book nor am I telling you not to either.

Steep strong coffee.4.
It controls it alright, no aroma at all!
I searched for a couple of months for a coffemaker that would do everything I wanted it to do.
Perhaps they should have not designed the "aroma control" feature.
Must be programmable.3.
Doesn't have a "gold filter"Please let me know!
I should have checked the other reviews just before buying this one.
Nope.
I hoped this would be the one.
Make at least 10 cups and still use a thermal carafe.2.
I miss the smell of fresh-brewed coffee that helps get me out of bed in the morning.
I guess I won't give my old West Bend away just yet.
I still haven't figured how much more beans I will need to make it strong enough.
The coffee tastes very weak.
Color available in black.5.
If there is a maker out there that will:1.

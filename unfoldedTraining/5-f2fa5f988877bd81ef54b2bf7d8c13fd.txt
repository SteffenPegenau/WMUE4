It was so much fun!
It's funny to know when he was in high school he was voted "funniest person," but also voted "least likely to succeed."
It keeps the inverview fun.
I just recently saw Robin Williams in concert back in October.
So much they know!
When Robin Williams is being interviewed, you know you will not be bored.
Ever since then, I've been seeing a lot of his movies on cable.
Ha!
I would recomend this dvd to anyone who is a Robin Williams fan, or even if you're not.
The man is a comic genius!!
I've seen this interview before on the Bravo network on cable.
I never knew it was on DVD.
It's fun to hear his side when he's talking about his family, the movies he's made, his life growing up, the schooling he had before he went into the entertaiment buisness.
If you want a good laugh, he will keep you in stitches!
During the interview, he does a lot of stand-up.
He had the audience in the theater laughing almost the entire time.

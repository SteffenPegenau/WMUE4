And found some of what is quoted inside to be of wonder.
This is a good read!!
Johnny Ramone is quoted many times.
And this is great!!
And with each story, The fish grow bigger!!
If Your at all a Ramone fan, Or even a fan of punk...BUY THIS BOOK!
I read it in around three days.
I was not there though.
But, So is My all time favorite bass guitarist Dee Dee Ramone.
I do wonder just how much of it was exaggerated!!
You know I think high of Monte!!
I bought this book being a long time Ramones fan!!
Many details about being on the road with the Ramones, Is revealed!!
But, Every fisherman has a story!!
So all I can do is wonder!!

These boots are all the same size 8 but they all fit a bit differently.
They fit.
No matter, they are all comfortable and a great value!Shoe city shipped the last pair...get some!
I recommend Street Moda as a seller.
I will not be able to tuck them in jeans.
I hope they are as good!I now have the white as well.
They are great looking and comfortable.
My calves are 16" and these barely fit.
So warm.
Both came from Street Moda,good seller!
Great prices and no problems with the shipping.I now have this boot in black and chestnut and so love them both!
My shoe size is 7 and I bought an 8.
I love them so much I went back for a second pair in another color.
These run wide in the toe area which works for me but they run short from toe to heel, thus a larger size was needed.
They are so beautiful.
I am now getting the white from another amazon seller since street moda is out.
My husband thinks they are sexy.

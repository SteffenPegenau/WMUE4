It could be that they are a little more melodic.
The end of "Liver vs. Heart" is pretty cool.
They definitely have a punky edge to them, but there is something more to them.
Whatever they sound like, it is awesome.
I dunno.
I like how "Boot Straps" begins slow and then all of sudden becomes a punk song.
Highlights include "Wha'd I Mean To Think You Said," "Feed Me," and "Heinz Von Foerster."
I don't know what it is, but it makes them good.
They are a little different than most of the other grunge bands out there.
Even though "Bag of Wood" starts off like a ballad it is still quite a good song.
To me it sounds like a mix of the the Toadies and Cell maybe?
Kind of.
I was pleasently surprised.
I had just remembered seeing them on AMG as grunge, so I thought "Hey, I better get this."
I had no idea what I was getting when I got this.

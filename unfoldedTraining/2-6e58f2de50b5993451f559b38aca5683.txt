But this time, Paulsen's show never got on TV.
What's the chance of your pilot having a heart attack, then you somehow land on a island, make fire, and survive 45 days in the wilderness?
This book got 2 stars from me because the end played in well with all the dullness.
Nothing ever did.
I suggest this book to old people who like action movies but not the books.
I had to read Hatchet in 6th grade and it was so boring.
You are a great author.
Every chapter I was waiting for something to happen.
What went wrong?
1/1000.
I beg your pardon Gary Paulson.
This is like Maury, he always plays the same show more that once.
Man gets on island, man makes fire, man gets saved.
The story is very predictable.
This story is just like the movie "Cast Away", except instead of the man talking to a volleyball, Bryan talks to himself.

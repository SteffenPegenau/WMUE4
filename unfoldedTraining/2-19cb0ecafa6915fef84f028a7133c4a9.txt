Everything seems to add interference.
Some days just turning your head a few inchs when I am a feet from the unit is enough for them to loose signal.
Now I have refurbished RS130s that work excellently, and they run in rechargable AAA's!
I would get the RS130s
In 2004 I bought the RS-40.
I have these at home for my PC.
Have owned these for a year now.
They worked great but I broke them by standing on them.
The surround sound on these is not that decernable.
I don't bother to charge them on the stand, I rotate batteries between a charger and the headphones.
I think reception quality trumps surround dound in the end.
At work I have had 2 pairs of sennheiser headphones.
I would not recommend them.
Its tollable but thats not the best thing to say about headphones.
Neither Senn's really have the "surround sound" but I can't tell the difference to be honest.

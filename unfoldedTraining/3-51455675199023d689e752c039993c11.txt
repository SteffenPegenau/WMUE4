after hearing the Entire "fragile album" (by D.O.A.)
another great song is ("I PROMISED MYSELF") it will simply bring tears to your eyes!
I am pleased, with what they have accomplished on this album.
"very disappointed") I hope they release a new album soon with all new material.
"a great classic" (D.O.A.)
but until then, I'll be dancing to "FRAGILE" over and over again...
), I love what they did to "BLUE CHRISTMAS" (it's simply a "beautiful song" D.O.A.
has ever did!
LOVE SONG!
(all in all) "FRAGILE" is in deed, a good album.
(really terrible "remakes" of there old stuff.
with some very good songs, (although,) the old classic songs they did on the album, is another story.
there are some very "catchy songs" (like for instant) ("I PARALYZE") 'a"great danceable energetic hipnotic song".
(and much to my surprise!
the rest of the album should have never been made.

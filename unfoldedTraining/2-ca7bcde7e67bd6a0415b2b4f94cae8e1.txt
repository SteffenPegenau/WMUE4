etc.
)But please, people, this is sell-out since it isn't thrash and Metallica made it to get more radio play.
Shame on them.
It's sell-out, face it.
I figured they deserved something for being better than the other mainstream bands, such as Taproot, Puddle of Mudd, P.O.D., Creed, Nickelback, Linkin Park, etc.
This band died with Cliff.
Is it thrash?
Um, this album WAS a sell-out.
It's alternative with a bit of a metal edge made by a bunch of Gucci-wearing, (...).
etc.
Let's call it for what it is.Why the 2 stars?
That's like trying to argue Saddam Hussein is not guilty.
It's sell-out.
No.
These guys may be sell-outs but they still play better stuff than all those other bands and they can still play live shows well.(...

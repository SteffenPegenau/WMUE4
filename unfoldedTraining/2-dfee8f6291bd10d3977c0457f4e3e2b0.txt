Sturdy.
There were heat discolorations at the tips from the rough grinding operation.
One is larger than the other: an eighth of an inch longer and about a sixteenth of an inch wider.
Just got the fork, and it looked good at first.
It would be like trying to pierce meat with a flat punch or a screw driver.The tines are different sizes.
Or maybe just send it back.
Then I noticed that the tines were not sharp, even a little.
I looked closer at the tines.
The design is good.
I may just use a file and a stone on it to make it usable.
Not what I expected from All-Clad, even if it is made in China.
The outside surfaces are polished, but the inside surfaces of the tines are rough, as though from casting.
Stainless steel.
Probably the latter.
Not much curvature in the tines, but usable.
The roughness and the flat tips would tear the meat, not penetrate smoothly.This shows very bad QC.
It's not usable as received.
The tips had been ground off flat with an electric grinder.

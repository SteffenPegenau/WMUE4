She has a natural sense of timing and emotional restraint.
You don't have to be male to wonder whether hookers can ever share genuine feelings with their customers.
Surely he can find more meaningful work for her in Hollywood.
The woman can act.
3.3 stars at best.
She knows how to be sexy without trying.
The greatest disappointment to me is why, when she has such natural acting ability, does Sasha Grey keep making porno films?
This film answers that question and the answer is yes.
The greatest surprise was Sasha Grey.
Steven Soderburgh directed this film for godsake!
It was only with great hesitation that I even decided to watch Girlfriend Experience.
She knows how to say more with less.
Would it just be more trash?
Let me say first off, it's a minor film, not very good.
The film was a real surprise for me.
But I had seen some of Sasha Grey's porno films, so I wondered: Would it be lurid and sexy?

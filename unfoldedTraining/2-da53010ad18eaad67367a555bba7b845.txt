I got the Mega 2 play land.
This should have been my first clue.
When I first got the package, I noticed that the plastic covering was torn.
I determined that I was going to get a different brand all together because I was unhappy with the order.
The balls, besides used already, were very cheap and squished easily.
I will be ordering a different brand all together from Toys R Us.
Infact, it's a cheaper one that costs 10$ less.
I'm sending it back tomorrow ( i got it today).
Without the addition of the balls, I set it up and my 1 year old loved it.
The balls that were supposed to come with the play set were opened and had hair on them.
The product was NOT what the picture is.
The tunnels don't even connect right...there are big holes where they attach.
The set is flimsy, attaches cheaply, and falls over very easily.
Overall this product sucks.
I found it at Toys R US for 47$.
I bought this toy for my 1 year old.
disappointed.....

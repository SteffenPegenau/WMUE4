This product is amazing.
Like, losing self-confidence bad!Tried a woman's razor with moisture beads but that didn't work either.
I still picked up ingrown whiskers but they were smaller.
Something happened in January 2009.
I could shave with a buck-knife, slap on some lotion then be good to go.
The Mach 3 razor plus BARC gave me no ingrown whiskers for the first time in six months!
Went to Amazon, found it then read the reviews: Eric M. is right on the money!
Ultra-smooth shave but my face exploded with ingrown whiskers.
It was awful.I went to a disposal which helped but gave a lousy shave.
I switched to the Gillette Fusion.
I was at a loss about what to do.
I mean, bad.
Finally, I read in Grooming Lounge about BARC.
No, I don't work the company
Most barely worked or worse, burned the skin.
I noticed electric razors gave me ingrown whiskers plus not a clean shave.
BARC works!
Spent over $300 on products which claimed to to prevent or stop ingrown whiskers.

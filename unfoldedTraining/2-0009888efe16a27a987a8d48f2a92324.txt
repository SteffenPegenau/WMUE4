And sorry to all the Diehard Slipknot fans out there who think this is their best album yet.
I was never a HUGE slipknot fan.
I completely sympathize.
Overall i'm pretty much speechless on how big a piece of trash this album is, which is why i heavn't written much.
WHY?
But this is not.
Duality is an ok song, but alas, the radio has ruined it for me by playing it over and over and over and over again.
We'd all be a lot better off.
This?
Opium For The People Before I Forget and mabye Pulse of The Maggots are the only other songs on this Disk that are worth mentioning.
I own Iowa and think that is a truly remarkable piece of work.
Who knows, i could've become one, but this album sure as hell didnt help.
WHY?
I don't know what to say to this.I've been to numerous Slipknot concerts and have enjoyed jumpingdafukup with them and this cd has ruined that.
Awesome screaming, growling, and singing as well.
Mabye Corey should've stayed with Stone Sour.

I have been looking for this CD for a while.
Solid drum playing.
There are some other bands used violin to great extend.
Eddie Jobson's UK and Kansas to name a couple.
Just not special.
Imagine Genesis+Gentle Giant), excellent arrangement...
Their music is good or listenable but there are tons of better CDs to buy in the world.
But the music of England is very very enjoyable (Strongly recommended.
This band reminds me a British band called 'England'.
FM had a violin player but I couldn't hear anything exciting or impressive.
Kinda not-very convincing vocal.
I like them a lot.
But good music anyway.
Not a level of master overall though.
Maybe too much expectation.
Good use of early synthesizer.

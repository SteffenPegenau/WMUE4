My mac cannot find the printer when I hook it to the USB port.
It makes a pretty good copier at least.
NO F'N way buddies.
However, the HP installer does crash my computer.
SOOO I figured I can just use the USB port.
Other than that its a rather expensive paper weight.
No such luck.
Soft PC does not seem to work.
I have an older HP (Office jet G55Xi).
I will never buy another HP product, and (especially if you are a mac user) I urge you to consider companies that actually make usable products.
So, I call them.
Its out of warranty.
It worked sort of ok for a year or so (each print job did crash the network), but when I upgraded my network well it quit working.
I have the Jet direct server, which can be upgraded, and presumably that would help, but it requires a PC (I have macs) to do the upgrade.
Please have your credit card ready to pay for support.

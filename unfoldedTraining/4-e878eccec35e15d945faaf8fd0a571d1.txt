I loved the characters although I never quite understood Forney.
I was so enthralled in this book that I wanted nothing left out.
Truly enjoyable.
This book showed me another side and gave me a true appreciation for my life and all that I have.
I passed it on to a friend.
Perhaps that says it all.
I enjoyed the author's literary style.
I couldn't put this book down and I am not sure why.
I laughed and I cried.
No one could capture the emotion and raw experience that the author filled us with on film.
That is what I liked the most.
Stick with the book.
I know that says alot about the author.
As far as a movie version.
I got angry and was happy.
The only thing that disappointed me in this book is the way it would lead you down a path and then skip to a time in the future.
The ending was quite abrupt but I was not dissatisfied.

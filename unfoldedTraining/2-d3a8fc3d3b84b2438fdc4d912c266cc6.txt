I wouldn't pay more than that.
I read all the reviews before purchasing this on Amazon for my 5-year old daughter for Christmas 2008.
The SAME questions come up time and time again.
They have movie scenes and seek and find stuff.
The whole concept is really fun.
My daughter thinks she is amazing at this.
Probably because IT DOES NOT ROTATE THE QUESTIONS.
That is the frustrating part.
i only paid $[...].
I wouldn't mind this as much if the game was less repetative.
The remote will NOT work.
If they would only have a shuffle to it the game would not be so boring.
It is quite fun.
You have all these "trivia" type questions they ask about the princesses in the disney movies.
We have to act like we don't know some answers because in truth we have seen the same ones over and over again.

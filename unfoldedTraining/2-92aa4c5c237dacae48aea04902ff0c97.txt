My copy would not allow me to use the English subtitles, so I watched it in German.
The sex scenes are very mild, I wouldn't even give them a "soft porn rating", but I'm sure, back in the day, it was quite risque'.
Runs 74 minutes.
Most of the violence or killings is mild , or the act is done off screen so you don't see it being done.
Soledad Miranda does have a wonderfull body, and you do get to see it from time to time [ just not enough ].
There is some female nudity, but no male nudity that I recall.
This movie is from 1970, which I like, but is very slow paced by todays standards.
This review will be a bit different.
It didn't detract from my viewing pleasue.
The transfer to dvd was pretty good, no scratchy or worn out spots.
They wouldn't even show her husband slitting his own wrists.
For blood or gore value, very little.
For erotic value, not much.
So, for historic value it is just fine.
2 1/2 stars.l

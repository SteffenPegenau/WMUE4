OK ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME AT ALL KNOWS THAT I LOVE DOLLS.
YOU CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!!
IF I HAD TO RATE THIS DOLL ON CLOTHING ALONE SHE WOULD BE A NEGATIVE 10!!!!!!!
AND ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME WELL KNOWS THAT I LIKE THE BRATZ DOLLS AND THAT SASHA IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
IT'S REALLY NOT THAT FREAKING HARD!!!!!
I AM GIVING HER A 4 BECAUSE SHE *IS* SO PRETTY & BECAUSE YOU *CAN* CHANGE HER CLOTHES.
IS SHE EVEN WEARING ANY BOTTOMS?????
IT SURE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT!
MY PROBLEM IS WITH HER NON-EXISTENT PANTS/SKIRT.
THAT BEING SAID I NEED TO SAY THAT THIS DOLL IS COMPLETELY INNAPROPRIATE.
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON THE DOLLS!
BUT COME ON MGA WHAT IN THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING???
I MEAN REALLY THESE CLOTHES MAKE THIS DOLL LOOK LIKE A WHORE.
!
GRANTED SHE IS A VERY PRETTY DOLL WITH BEAUTIFUL HAIR & GORGEOUS MAKE-UP.
NO ARGUMENT THERE!

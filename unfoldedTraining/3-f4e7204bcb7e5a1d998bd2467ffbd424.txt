The first four tracks are good, and I don't mind Virtue and Vice.
Their first three albums (Shake Your Money Maker, Southern Harmony..., and Amorica) easily top this effort.
Cliched and lame.
Now this album isn't all bad.
Here's hoping the Black Crowes reunion happens and they get back to their rockin ways.
Amen.
What hurts the most, I think, are the lyrics.
It is better than a lot of material out there today.
It is not.
As for the music, sure it's catchy, but that's all it has going for it for the most part.
But for truly great albums, check out the first three Crowes efforts.
The problem is I've heard the previous Crowes albums, which blow this out of the water.
If you have heard these albums and find them a but much, or if you like more radio friendly music, you may very well like this album.
I don't mind love songs, I guess, but this is too much.
I can't believe that some reviewers have said that this is the best Black Crowes album.

Haier does not repair these machines under warrenty.
Also, they advertise these as two level washing.
When the machine works, it does a great job of cleaning the dishes.
So, it is cost effective to just buy two or three of them and use the non-working ones for parts.
But, they do a good job on the dishes.
You have to be willing to do the repairs yourself if you want one that will work and last.
They just replace them and all you get is another machine that won't work.
However, getting one that works is a problem.
They are not!
Once you get the sloppy assembly problems fixed, the machine will last a good while.
Since there are very few dishwashers available in this size and none of them have very good reviews, I continue to buy the Haier dishwasher.
About one in three will continue to work after the first week.
I have bought several of these machines.
The machine is cheap.
There doesn't seem to be much quality control at the factory.
I don't bother with the warrenty.

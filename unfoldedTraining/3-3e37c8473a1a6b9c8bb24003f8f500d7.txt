I say, read "Q-Squared".
The highlight of this book is the BAD Troi.
I would not get it unless you have read all the other books you wanted to read.
It is completely an opposite style of "Dark Mirror".
They say the "empire" was tooken over, it still exsists in this book
She tends to be too wordy.
I prefer an auther like Michael Jan Friedman or Peter David who knows all about Star Trek but have a sense of humor about it.
The last couple of chapters are too "techno-bablish".
So in summary, this book is a "5".
It shouldn't be a priority.
Hwiii the dolphine is LAME.
Not bad, not good.
Diane Duane is an intelligent author.
"Dark Mirror" starts off really slow, but picks up by the middle/end.
Also, the GOOD Picard is very good too.
But she is to serious about it.
She knows her Star Trek.
Oh, lastly, the DS9 shows have changed the "history" of this.

It is the most expensive Lego set I have purchased.
Overall this is a nice set and you could sell now or a few years later for a lot of money.
The tie fighter is not bad, but I do not really like it.
It also has a red droid and pilot.
It has Darth Vader with a cloak and light saber.
I believe I got it the year it came out so it was fifty dollars.
They are actually two red lights on the cockpit.
The top and bottom parts of both wings and can be adjusted to different angles.
The wings can and will sometimes fall off, but if you would like a tie advanced fighter it would be good.
The rotating turret is nice, and the engines are really cool.
It has two guns on the front.
It is a nice set, I like the Y-wing the most.
Now it is expensive but you might be able to get it used on eBay for cheaper.
So, if you like one or both of these set from the star wars movies this would be a good set.
This is a set I bought for my birthday a few years ago.
It is quit sturdy with two storage compartments.

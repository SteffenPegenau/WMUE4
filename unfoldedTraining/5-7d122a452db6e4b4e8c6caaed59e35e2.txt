GO TO THE FINISH LINE!
If you're a beginner,I wouldn't suggest it until you work you're way up.
Everytime I do this workout, I feel I won't make it, and I never stop in a workout.
I agree with one of the reviews that someone posted.
=) Good Luck!
I always go to the finish line!
The music is awesome.
THIS ROCKS AND I WOULD SUGGEST THIS TO AN ADVANCED PERSON who wants a BIG CHALLENGE!
I've been a fan of Billy Blanks Tae Bo for years.
Billy Blanks voice is so motivational, it helps me thru.
LOL.
I bought this DVD and let me just say, you're work out clothes will be dripping in sweat.
And so is his crew, aren't they always!
Just like Billy Blanks saids.
This workout is for an hour, then there's the extra 30 minutes, that you feel you won't be able to do, but I have a few times..and it's so awesome when you finish.

Sure, AIDS haven't existed yet, but still... That was the thing I hate about the movie.
He made me laugh so much.
I've seen the movie by my English teacher.
(Some scenes may not concern you.)
I think that Judge Reinhold (as Brad Halminton) is the best character.
Some people were good, some were not that good.
People has sex with everybody, get pregnant.
And if you don't like sex (or too young) stay home and rent a comedy.
In the movie, he is a very good brother.
Stacey Halminton (Jenneifer Jason Leigh) is an irresponsible girl.
It reflects well the reality of that year.
But I can say that it was a good movie.
If you're not yet, wait untill you're at least 15.
I liked and disliked it.
I would recommand this movie to all people who's 15 and up.
She got pregnant with a stranger (stupid enough).
It seems to be funny and also dangerous.
Compared to today's life, 1982 was a "dude" life.
Do they care about VD?

I will never own another JVC product.
If ever there was a "no star" product, it is this nightmare.
It only dubs when it feels like it.
What he didn't say was, again, and again, and again.
I would say electronic device, but it is less trustworthy than anything purchased from an infommercial for $ 19.95.
This thing makes Regan in The Exorcist look like a beginner.
Once it started flashing blue, displayed the term "LOADING" and wouldn't allow me to operate my television for a day and a half.
Class action lawsuit anyone?
At first it was minor things.
And frequently it only plays tapes that somehow are to it's liking.

Tonight it ate a tape.
Since I took it out of the box it has never worked correctly.
Then after another trip back to the store for repair, an employee said "Yeah, We've had to take all these things in for repair."
And to the person who said his was working...the clock is ticking.

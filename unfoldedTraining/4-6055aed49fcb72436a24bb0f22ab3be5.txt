* The basket, while a pretty good size, is really hard to access when the seat is fully reclined (as it has to be when you put your infant seat on it)* The canopy is pretty small.
I just can't get it to fit!
* Size, just right.
So many of my mom friends got huge strollers with their carseat and end up really disliking how big it is and buying another stroller later on.
* Comfortable for her and me.
It ought to, it's there...
:)Cons:* I never could get the cupholder to snap on.
Very affordable.
It's comfortable for my daughter, it has a nice basket, the handles are comfortable, it's easy to push, and my infant seat snaps onto it!
I love that it folds down so small for my vehicle and isn't a huge stroller to push around.
They all comment on how mine's the perfect size.
I love this stroller!
* Easy to use.
It is not perfect, but in terms of size it is!
* Folding it down and unfolding it up really does take two hands.Pros:* Price!

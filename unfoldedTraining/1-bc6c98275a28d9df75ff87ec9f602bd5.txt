I must admit, I am probably the only female that reads this series of books that is not that fond of the Ranger character as a romantic interest.
This book was a big disappointment for me.
It was a short, quick read that ended far too abruptly.
Joe or Ranger?
I will admit, I never get tired of Lula and Grandma Mazur.
Those characters are always a lot of fun and they provided a few laughs.
Yes, he's "mysterious and sexy", that's all well and good, but what woman would want to seriously become involved with a man who seemingly has no interaction with his only child?
I think I'm simply getting tired of this series.
Actually, I think the decision is obvious.
My main problem with this character is her indecisiveness.
Make a decision already!
She does not seem to grow in any way and doesn't seem to want to.
It's just not enough to keep me interested anymore.
The Stephanie Plum character is loosing her charm for me.
Does she really think there is a future with Ranger?

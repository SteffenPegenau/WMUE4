I own another Vantec drive of a different model.
I then have to turn off the drive and turn it back on.
Build quality is good.2.
But I really like the build quality.
Here are the pros and cons of the drive.PROS:1.
I guess you get what you pay for.
Both of them have the same way to install a hard drive.
After several screws, you are done.
But if you don't keep the drive on all the time like me, this is not an issue.2.
Drive is not accessible after wakeup from standby on Windows.
This drive looks very nice.
It is a little on the high-end side.
With this, I will not buy this enclosure again.
But I think the aluminum case works to dissipate the heat, too.CONS:1.
I know it also has something to do with the drive.
This is the biggest problem.
Price.
Looks great.
After hours of use, the case is only warm.
Has eSATA support.3.

Just one of many great songs on his Measure Of A Man cd.
The Way soars with Clay Aiken's vocals.
Solitaire is one of those "song of songs" that will now and always be associated with Clay Aiken.
The way that you move me.
What he does with this is amazing!
sing it Clay!
there are not enough subperlatives to describe this song!
To say these are great songs would be a travesty!

The Neil Sedaka song Solitaire .
.
It is hauntling beautiful, reaching in and touching your heart so softly, as it soars in your soul.
This man can sing.
His phrasing is so awesome on the song!

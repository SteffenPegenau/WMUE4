Best of luck.
Chogyam Trungpa was considered one of the greatest meditation masters in American Buddhism.
I have talked to many many people in the last twenty years who knew him.
Just do what the Dalai Lama suggests.
I thought "uh-oh!"
Be wary with any personal teacher.
His conduct was, to say the least, deplorable.
He was a brillant man who understood the inhibitions and neurosis of Westerners possibly better than any teacher who has taught Tibetan Buddhism in the West.
Many years ago, I saw a young girl sitting on a park bench reading this book.
I no longer became embarrassed about being a human being.
The Karmapa approved of him totally.
He constantly violated four out of the five Buddhist precepts.
All of Trungpa's books and his teachings were fundamentally kind and compassionate.
I've read this book three times and took Shambala Training.
He helped me a great deal.
His books are and were great.
But sadly enough, we have to face facts.

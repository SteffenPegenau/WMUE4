I know, this pan replaced one of those cheaper non-sticks.
And we had some burned on vegatables on the bottom as our broth boiled off.
Bought it because i really like the hard anodized and really dislike non-stick interiors.
Problem with the cheap non-sticks is eventually the non-stick comes off.
Again, cleaned up real nice and brisket cooked in a shorter time.
Just used a Dobbie pad and Dawn, cleaned up real quick.
Also rosted 6# of brisket in it the other week.
Was impressed.
Well, this has no non-stick, so exactly what looking for.
So even tho $60, well worth the extra money from the cheap pans out there.
Even tho not a non-stick, the interior cleaned up with no effort.
Should have bought this the first time around.
Definitely get what you pay for.
Even so, soaked it a few hours, and went to clean.
Pan well worth the money.
Did a 19# turkey for Thanksgiving.
So in long run a waste of money.

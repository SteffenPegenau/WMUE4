But all the bad editting is wack.
If there had been, I would have put it aside until the others came out.
It sounded rad!
But it probably a good thing for me.
Oh well.I did not like that the book was left open for a second book to be made.
Still...the plot IS great.
The names were wrong.
I found out that it was not the case.
Too bad the one star did not show up until too late.
I gave it an extra star for the plot line.I noticed the name jumping too.
I do not like to feel left dangling.
By reading this one now, I won't bother buying any more.
There was nothing to suggest that this book was part of a duo or a trilogy or a series.
The five star review convinced me to purchase this one.
I might have reconsidered buying it.
But I figured he was trying to throw the bad guy off.

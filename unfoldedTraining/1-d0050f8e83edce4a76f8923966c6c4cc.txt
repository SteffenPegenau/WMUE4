I cried because of the sencless animal violence.
More like PG-13 or R for that matter.
I mean: who woulda thought that its possible to get so emmotional over fake looking dinosaurs???
Funny.
I tried watching it last week again.
The hippie airplane pilot says "Personally, I'd whip the b**ch."
Almost.
Lotsa swearing, violence, and naked ugly tribal chicks.
Ha ha.
I didn't cry this time, but I still hate it.
When he says "What would you do?"
I never even finished this movie.
Yea, VERY fake.
The only funny line in this entire piece of @#$% is when the guy tells his airplane driver about his wife.
Not to mention the rating.
I saw this once when I was little.

To all those folks who gave this cd five stars, have you really listened to it??
She has some of the greatest hit songs I've ever known.
I bought this without even glancing at the reviews.
BUT, what's happened to her?
Maybe she'll bounce back with something hot and sultry, like the old ones, that'll knock our socks off.
She sounds flat on a number of these cuts, and sounds lackluster on most of the others.
I really, really hope so.
She's been a top favorite of mine since the 70s.
I mean how could I ever go wrong with Carly Simon, right?
I say all of this to let you know, if you bothered reading this, that I am not trying to put her down in any way.
Hopefully this was just a fluke.
And her albums are wonderful!
I don't want to keep it.
I have every one of them as a matter of fact.
I LOVE Carly Simon!!
I've listened to it several times and can't get over the sad feeling it gives me.
My gosh!
It's pretty bad.

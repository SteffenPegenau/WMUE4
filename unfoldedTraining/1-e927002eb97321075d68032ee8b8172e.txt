It is like having Gone with the Wind and no Scarlett O'Hara!So, I'm sorry.
But that star is not Dick.
And what about Sally?
This is no stars because the two best stars are gone.
And it shines brightly for them, as if the star is a candle and it is flickering in the night, and it is wondering if they are okay...
This breaks my heart because I loved Spot and he was my friend!
When you make a major literary adaptation, you should at least have all the major characters in it.
Did he run away?
And this movie forgot the two best characters, Sally and Spot.
But she is not here and how can that be?
That star is not Jane.
Where is Spot?
Run, Spot, Run!But maybe he ran too far and is gone?
That star is for my Spot and my Sally.
I'm sorry but I didn't like this movie.
She was always with the mischief, and squirting the hose, and getting Dick and Jane all wet!
But I give it one star.

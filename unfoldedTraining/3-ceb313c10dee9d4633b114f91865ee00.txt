SUSPENSE THAT INTRIGUES YOU GREATLY AT TIMES.
THIS FILM LACKS MUSIC.
TAKE "PSYCHO" FOR EXAMPLE.
FURTHUREMORE, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE ONE OF HITCHCOCK'S BEST BLACK AND WHITE SOUND FILMS, I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND "THE LADY VANISHES"
THE ENDING IS NOT WELL PLANNED.
I WOULD SUGGEST SEEING IT AND YOU WILL SEE FOR YOURSELF THE OUTCOME.
IT HAPPENS TOO QUICKLY WITHOUT MUCH BACKUP.
WHILE VIEWING THIS, I HAD BECOME LOST IN A SENSE.
NOW JUST PICTURE THE SHOWER SCENE, WITHOUT THE CLASSIC OVERTURE THAT IS WELL KNOWN TO SCARE PEOPLE: ALONG WITH THE SCREAMS ETC.
MUSIC IS WHAT CREATES SUSPENSE.
BUT THIS FILM LACKS THESE ATTRIBUTES.
THIS IS MOST AGREEABLY, HIS BEST BRITISH FILM.
I DO REALIZE THAT THIS IS ONE OF HITCHCOCKS EARLIER FILMS AND THE SOUND IS SOMEWHAT HORRIBLE.
MUSIC IS THE MOST POWERFUL MOOD CREATOR EVER.
THERE WERE GOOD SCENES THAT HELPED THE FILM GREATLY, BUT THE LACK OF SUSPENSFUL SOUND IS WHAT CREATES THE SMALL QUALITY OF AN ENDLESS BORE.
WHAT DOES ONE EXPECT FROM HITCHCOCK?

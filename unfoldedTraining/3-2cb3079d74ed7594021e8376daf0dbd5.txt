They are better than blown or poorly designed factory speakers.
They make noise and you can hear the music.
I also used to be employed selling car audio at both Curcuit City and Best Buy.
Good luck!
These speakers will work depending on your goal.
I bought these speakers to replace the rear speakers in my 2001 Jeep Cherokee.
I have installed several sound systems in different cars that I have owned over the years.
For me, they work well for the rear speakers freeing up more money to be spent on the front speakers which you hear more of anyhow.
No dramatic lows or crisp highs.
As reflected in the price, are not your top of the line audiophile setup.
First off, my prior experience in car audio.
Just decent sound at an affordable price.
I am a little older now and have a child and spend my money differently.
I would even venture to say that some of the newer factory speakers would sound better.
I have had fairly expensive setups in past cars.

Why would you want to deface us?
I'm embarassed to read these women make so many mistakes.
And ever thing that these books can be condensed?
I want the last three hours back.
Hey Nora: how about you make a female character like that?
I consider myself a woman of intelligence so reading about women who don't even have common sense, but have doctorates is insulting.
So skip this long-winded mystery.
YOU'RE A WOMAN NORA!
Ugh.
Seriously?
Why do female authors feel the need to make their leading ladies stupid.
His description, actions and words really excite us as a reader.
More words do not make a better novel.
It made me begin to hate Nora's writing and find another novelist, so for now,onto a new author.The ONLY thing that was at all redeeming was Ryan the thief.
I love romance, but Nora, enough.
After a while, all you want to do is throw the book into a raging fire.

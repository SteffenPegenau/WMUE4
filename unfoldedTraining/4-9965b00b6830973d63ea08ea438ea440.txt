So, make sure you use the latest version.
I thought it was because of my Lenovo FireWire chipset...
I'm a computer programmer, so, I know what I'm talking about.
But... Accidentally, unpredictably, it starts BUZZZZIG and HUMMMING at the HIGHEST volume level!
It's not good for your reputation, really.
Thanks MOTU!
It can accidentally produce a signal that can damage your equipment and your ears!
And imagine you use it for a real performance!!!
In the new version it's solved.
Same thing.
So that, it's not safe for your ears, not to mention your amps and speakers.
This device is not safe!!!
Please, MOTU guys, please, fix your firmware ASAP!!!
My name is Maxim Shemanarev, if MOTU guys do care about their reputation, they HAVE to fix it ASAP!!
!Update: The problem was in the Drivers for Windows.
I tried it with a true TI-based FiWi.
I use this device MOTU 8Pre for my home experiments, it works most of the time.
That's impossible to use it as is now!

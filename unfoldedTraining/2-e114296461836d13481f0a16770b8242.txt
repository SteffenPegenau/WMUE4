Finally, at parts of importance, there was no stress to make them seem more important.
I liked the concept and the idea.
Also, it was to choppy.
There were not enough details given to support what was going on.
I think that the writing in this particular is more for younger childre, more of an elementary level.
Next, some parts were unclear.
Some other books about the holocaust that are a little more descriptive are "The Devil's Arithmatic" and "Number the Stars."
The story moved to fast.
Such as when a person was speaking.
In my opinion, you didn't get to know the characters well enough.
They didn't really develope.
There was just a brief description at the begining.
A few people were talking and there was no name in front of the speech so you didn't always know who was talking.
The story didn't flow very smoothly.
The writing could have been more descriptive so you get a good picture of what's goiong on.
The story is good.

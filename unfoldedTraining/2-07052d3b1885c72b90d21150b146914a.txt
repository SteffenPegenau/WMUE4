I think I hate it more because the material was not good enough for a stand alone story and there is no continuation.
As a stand alone it was waste.
the art was good.
I do want to slam the animation style.
Other wise.
Witch is a shame, Batman: Under a Red Hood, is one of the best DC Animated movies.
The story was plane and uninteresting.
Batman: Year one needs work or longer story arch.
This was not one of their better titles.
if the title was going to start a new series it could work.
this was the first and only big disappointment.
The charters do not come together that would answer any questions in any story line.
I will say buy this.
If you are collecting all the DC animated movies.
It could have set up a good 13 episode series, as a standalone, it needs work.
This was one origin story better left untold.
I am a fan of all the DC Animated Movies, I own them all.

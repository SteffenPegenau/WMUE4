Oh well.
Half of the graphic novel (and I mean a full half)was extra stories, not even featuring the cast of Girl Got Game.
I, actually, wanted to give it 3.5 stars, but rounded it to four.
(It came as a shock to me.)
Chiharu realizes Kyo is just trying to put up an act and calls him on it.
^_^
Kyo tries to act like "one of the guys", obsessing over girls.
It didn't help that didn't even like the short stories.
I still like and recommend this series, just be aware of what's in this volume.
Kyo decides he must act more like a guy and comes up with an idiotic plan to do it.
I didn't pay for the short stories, I wanted Girl Got Game.
In this volume Kyo must come up for an explanation of why Chiharu felt what he felt when he touched her chest.
I absolutely love the series Girl Got Game (Power!!).
What is poor Kyo going to do?Normally,I would give this series five stars.
I felt ripped off, like the series was trying to be dragged out in to more volumes so they could sell more.

I would have liked for him to have stepped on Matthew Broderick and his ditzy girlfriend and finished the movie giving a huge roar of triumph as he destroyed NYC.
I can act better cutting my toenails than she did in this movie.
This was a real clunker.
No big loss in my opinion.
I wish Matthew Broderick would have quit acting after "War Games".
And that girl.
He was the best actor in the film!
What story.
I did like the new Godzilla better than the rubber suited lizards of the past, thought they too have their charm.
The best scenes were of Godzilla running around the city dodging the military's finest.
What a dry, boring performance.
I rented this movie because, well, it was Saturday, the week-end, you know, and because I had always liked the Godzilla movies before this one.
All, in all, I would like to edit out all the humans and just have Godzilla destroying things for two hours.
And the story...STORY?
Why did Godzilla have to die in the end?

It has a nice user interface - too bad it doesn't work!
I suppose it really doesn't matter, but this is the slowest writing CD software I have ever seen.
Those didn't work either.
So far I have not received the email.
He told me where to get a fixed .DLL off the web from Microsoft.
The program crashed there.
The technician said he would send me email with more suggestions.
I called tech support and they gave me a couple of suggestions.
Everything went fine until I got to the part where it burns a CD.
A different tech discovered that there is a Microsoft .DLL file that is buggy.
This time it did install successfully.
Called tech support a second time.
(Doesn't matter because it didn't finish anyway.)
They ALL crashed.
I tried is several more times using different CD write speeds from 2X to 12X.
It crashed several times on installation.

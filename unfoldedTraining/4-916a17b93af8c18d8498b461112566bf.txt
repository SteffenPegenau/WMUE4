However, the levelness of the ground is a pain.
I have been using liquid cement repair kits.
Anyway the top part got holes in it.
All the water came out of it.
It has finally gone totally back down.
We also left it out all winter.
The kids love being in it.
I agree this was our fault.
I think this could happen to anyones pool at some point even if you don't leave it out all winter.
But at this point I don't think there is any hope in fixing it.
We gave up last year.
I think it is probably a fairly good pool if you take care of it.
I have given up.
Daily I fix it and blow it up.
I have a pool like this that we bought last year.
It is a pain to move and heavy if even a little water is in it.
I have been repairing and repairing to no end.
A pet could poke holes in it.

Anyway, now it is hanging on my front porch and makes a nice decoration.
Overall, I'm happy with it.
It is really very pretty, but I have a couple of complaints.
(I wondered about this before I ordered it.)
It hardly makes a sound even if you knock the teardrops together.
However, it does not chime.
Surprisingly, it does not tangle, even when the wind blows it.
My other complaint is although it was well-packaged, by the time I had cut the tape and removed the tissue from each teardrop, I had a tangled mess.
I do wish it had clear line or thin wire instead of the black nylon cords holding the teardrops, but that's not a big deal.
I received this last week.
I was nearly ready to throw it away before I got it untangled.
I'm going to order an actual windchime, though.
The colors are vibrant and the it seems well-made.
The copper wires surrounding the glass drops prevent them from chiming.
The box it came in said windchime.

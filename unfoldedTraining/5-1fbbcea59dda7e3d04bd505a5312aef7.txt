It was fracking amazing.
Tricia Helfer (Nr.
I really fracking got into this fracking good series.
It is like watching the Matrix and Star Wars at the same time.
But she also can act.
6) is worth the price of admission alone.
The "space combat" scenes are really good.
But seriously, great show (the characters use the word "frack" as a swearword constantly in the series).Fires on all cylinders.
It is amazing.
Great casting, great acting, great plot.
I like the fact that the ships don't look computer-generated.
!
There is "just enough" humor in the series to keep it from being too somber, too.
There are tons of sub-plots and things that come back around, so to speak.
I would pay to watch her read the phone book for an hour.
They look like real, three-dimensional objects with weight and mass.
The "religious" stuff gets on my nerves a bit, but hey, this is fantasy, so what the heck.I put this up there with the "Wire" as the two best shows ever on TV (cable).Now go fracking watch it !

For a time there, I loved them.
Please...stay away from this.
Crawling is like the worst song ever.
Techno/rock/rap?
Where are the guitar solos, or inventive lyrics?
Then I sold the CD and was like "they're kind of good, but not for me".
Where's the originality in today's music?
But now I hate them.
God, no.
This is not rock, nor rap.
It needs more substance, more thought, more energy.
It comes off as boring and there are a million better bands.
And why do they make awful videos?
And when a genre-bending band like Lostprophets can efficiently make good music, why bother with Linkin Park?
Then I liked them.

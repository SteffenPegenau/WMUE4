It was a waste to watch all of the episodes to have no ending.
There wasn't any closure or real ending.
I hadn't seen the last few episodes, and was very disappointed by the ending.
Done.
The series ended when they decided to cancel it.
If you haven't seen the last few episodes, don't buy the DVDs.
The end.
No send off.
The characters and their story lines came to a screeching halt.
Save your money and time.
I liked this show when it was on tv, so I decided to get the DVD.
It seemed like they were told to show the episode airing that week and that's it.
There were alot of added characters in the last episode and some of the main characters ad few to no lines.
Nothing.
No big finish.
Nothing changes for the characters in the end.
The finale should have been at least two parts.

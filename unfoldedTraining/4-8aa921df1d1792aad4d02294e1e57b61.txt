Slow ride is alright.
I would pay 40 bucks for just the first four songs.
Their live album is also pretty good.
The first 4 tracks are great.
"Romeo" is awesome.
I only give it four stars because i don't like every song and everybody inflates this rating system like mad, most people are pretty dumb.
This album is much better than robbin the hood, and i listen to this album more than 40 ounces or the self titled.
I never liked don't push that much and it's on 40 oz.
I absolutely love the ubtown dub version of doin time (the first track).
New Realization is good.
The version of chic on my tip on 40 ounces is better.
Badfish i can never get sick of.
Saw red is excellent and so is superstar punani.
Basically i like most of the songs.
"Get Out" is really good.
Had a dat is good, trenchtown rock is very good.

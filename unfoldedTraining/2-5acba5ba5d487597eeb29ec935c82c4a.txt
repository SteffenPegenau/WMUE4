What was their link?
Why were they so similar in appearance?
As other reviewers have said, there are a lot of extraneous characters.
How are they related?
The book I had included a page of art depicting the aliens.
They weren't elephant-like, they were elephants!
I love the 'alien invasion' genre.
It never did.
You cannot explain this by parallel evolution, but the authors never bother to explain their relationship.And the ending just sucked!
And how the hell does Harry Red get himself insterted throughout the entire storyline?
We never find out.
I was dissapointed.
I read this book waiting for all the threads and story-lines to wrap up in a nice satisfying package.
I waited patiently for this part of the plot to evolve.
I was waiting for some point in the story for the reason or 'link' between the aliens and earth elephants.
The book could have been reduced by 20 to 30% by eliminating some of the unneccessary characters and sub-plots.And then you have the elephantine aliens.

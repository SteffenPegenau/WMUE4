I had to find out who were these cats rhyming over this DJ Premiere beat.
It's like the Lox rhyming over Quincy Jones Beats!
When I found out it was Pitch Black, I had high expectations for this album.
When I first heard "IT'S All Real".
The beats he produced on are (Geechy, My Life) those tracks really hurt the album.
These are some hardcore street cats, why is Teddy Riley producing on this album.
Swizz Beats produced 2 tracks (Shake That, N.Y.C.)
My overall opinion of this album is 3 stars.
album.
Now this album is finally here I'm mad disappointed.
They got appearances by Buster Rhymes and Foxy Brown but they didn't help the album any.
Over all it's a O.K.
I wouldn't tell my boys to run out and get this album.
But no beats to back em up.
Those tracks are O.K.
Once they get better production these cats will be a group to look out for.
These cats lyrics are forreal.

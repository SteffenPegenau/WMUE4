The ending is very predictable.
(She had much more depth in her role in Vertigo.)
Call me bored.
Jack Lemmon's womanizing friend was very unappealing.
This movie starts with the married couple Jack Lemmon and Judy Holiday divorcing each other.
It turned my stomach listening to his little speech on various ways to try to get a woman in bed.
That would be okay, except the journey to the end is not much fun.
There are flashbacks showing the couples courtship and these might be a little appealing with a different actress.
This movie is suppose to be a romantic comedy.
There isn't any humor, and the script is just boring.
However, the picture was crystal clear.
Great copy of the movie.
Judy Holiday is just not an appealing actress.
Then there are scenes of Jack and Judy trying to learn to become swinging singles.
Kim Novak is not in the movie very much, and she comes across as a young bimbo.

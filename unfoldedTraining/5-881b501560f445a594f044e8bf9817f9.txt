I am large and muscled...240 pounds...and it works great on me.
(It feels like about fifteen minutes, though we've never timed it.)
I wish we had one years ago.
My only complaint is there isn't a button that allows me to force it to concentrate on one area.
My wife is very petite...5'2" on a good day and 114 pounds...and I think she enjoys it more than I do.
It does a very good job of relaxing the back.
It is a strudy unit.
Then I let it fly over the rest of my back after a while.
I purchased it for $79 with a coupon.
(It is always waiting for us.)
I just wish it included the neck.
We immediately fell in love with this purchase.
It sits well in the chair we selected for it.
I turn the "lower back" button on and off to force it to stay down there.
I don't feel like I have to keep my weight off of it.
Don't wait.
We both love the fact that it shuts itself off after a certain number of series.
She has to place a towel over the rollers.
Buy now.

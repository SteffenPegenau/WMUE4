but yes definitely worth the read.
Then i kept on reading and as pleasantly surprised.
Then i started reading it and was like ugh, he's gonna preach about his life.
However, sometimes it seemed he gets TOO much into his own life and off the track off zen.
Hardcore Zen?
Overall, it's written in a way to relate and make readers understand.
Punk?
It's not over the top Buddhism, i feel it relates to average people.
I feel he gave me a good idea of the importance of "living in the now" and enjoying empty space.
What??
As far as people say "he shouldn't be bashing others" i pretty much disagree because let's face it.
I enjoyed how this book is down to Earth.
haha, we should all be able to express that view and why it sucks.
Some things other people do SUCK.
I was also surprised to see he was a monk and with hair!
I picked up this book a little skeptical.

See I used to have some friends and we used to communicate on a website.
When he writes about his life... evocative... powerful... achingly beautiful.
I love Harry Knowles but...
I can see the movies myself.
It was also way way too short.
I really can really identify with his struggle.
I want to know more about the man.
Dont worry folks, I am sure that his second book will be better.
It's time.But when he writes about movies... boring.
I was dissapointed with this book.
But then one of them made a joke about me and played me like I was his two bit punk.
This book gave me hope!
The part about his mother being killed for the insurance money moved me to tears.
I ran away and could not face them anymore.
I can't make excuses anymore.
I was so ashamed of myself.
Now I am going to make movies.
Especially his romances.

Three+ year life is good for a watch band for me.
I always figured I had medium wrists.
I fit best at the center one with three empty on each side.
The band is fine.
It fits well.
I have no problems with it.
Small wrists?
I'm ordering the exact same band as it is still working great for me and I still love the style.
Great band.
It was a little stiff the first few days but easy to insert the end in the loop now.
I love this watch.
Couldn't find just the band on Amazon but a web search found another vendor pretty easily.
Style is great.
Maybe so.
But the band is showing wear now so I'm replacing it.
I've had it about a month.
I like the metal grommets both for style and function.
Regardless, this watch is great for me.04/06/2012It's been over three years and I still love this watch.
Others complain about the band.
There are 7 grommets.

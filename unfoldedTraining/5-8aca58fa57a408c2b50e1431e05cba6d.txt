The Strange Illness of Mr Arthur Cook
I'll give this a solid recommendation for kids who enjoy supernatural stories.The book is superbly illustrated with ink wash sketches by Ted Lewin.
I recently read "The Shadow Cage" by Philippa Pearce, who of course is perhaps best known forTom's Midnight Garden.This is a collection of ten slightly creepy tales for middle-grade readers.

I have some other books that have been illustrated by this artist, and his work is fantastic; I really like it.
Here, I'll upload a few examples from this book to Amazon.The stories included in this book are:1.
At the River Gates5.
Reading this reminded me that I really should look up more of the author's work.
The Shadow Cage2.
Moderately tame, compared to what is published for this age group today (this book dates from 1977), but very satisfying.
The Running-Companion7.
The Dog Got Them10.
Miss Mountain3.
The Dear Little Man with His Hands in His Pockets9.

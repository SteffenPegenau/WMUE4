Honestly.
The documentary special feature "Burning Sand" is almost as bad.I really, really, really want that two hours + of my life back.
Ever.
Whoever financed this were utter fools.
Have.
I.
There is the barest hint of an idea in the premise on the DVD blurb, but it is NOT executed.
The.
Worst.
This makes all the other bad movies I've seen look like Shakespeare.
Seen.One star is too many.
There is no script, no plot, no characters, no story, no scenes, no acting, no direction.
Movie.
There is no attempt to even tell a story.
The audio and video quality are atrocious.

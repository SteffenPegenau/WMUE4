Oh I did.
But man what Graphics.
It really does look good though!
Just keep tapping those buttons and watch Ulala [dance]!
WOW What a twist...did you see that coming or what.
It was not terribly fun to play unless of course you think simon says needed a championship.
And just when you think you're Denny Terrio on Dance Fever you gotta do everything reverse of what they do.
And then go to the next scene and tap those buttons And watch Ulala [dance] some more!
Oh I did, well then tap those buttons in time with the music and watch Ulala [dance]!......some more?
Well than tappity-tap tappity-tap-tap tap-tappity Look im dancing!
Cool graphics, oh my god I just saw Michael Jackson!
And then go to the next scene and watch Ulala [dance]......again?
This was an extremly hyped game and while I must admit it was a beautifully rendered game it has the depth of a teaspoon.
Oh did I say this game looks great!
Did I mention the graphics?

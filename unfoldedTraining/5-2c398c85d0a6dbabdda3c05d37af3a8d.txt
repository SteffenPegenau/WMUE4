I started the book, and was required to read it in a couple weeks, and ended up reading it in three days.
Card is very detailed about everything.
In the book, Peter, Ender's brother, has a major influence over world events when he is fourteen.
Orson Scott Card just drew me in.
Ender's Game has an amazing plot, and is very interesting.
When I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.
I think that in the future we could go live on a different planet like Ender does.
The stuff in this book was science fiction, so it probably wouldn't happen now.
But it could in the future.
It has all the essential parts of a great novel.
It is a very detailed science fiction book.
Ender's Game is an awesome book.
I liked how he put so much detail in Ender's virtual game.
I haven't read the other books in the series, but I hope that they are all as good as or better than this one.
Card explained it like if you were playing it.
I was amazed how the kids are so intelligent.

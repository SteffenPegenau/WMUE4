I guess you get what you pay for.
Once I received them I realized why that was the price.
The stitching was cheap and it looks like some thread is coming off.
Overall, I am not angry at the purchase but just disappointed.
You definitely get what you pay for.
I looked at these because the price was great.
It seemed liked a great value.
I had those last time but they seemed a little expensive but I know why.
Next time I will spring for the harbingers.
If you need the padding and durability because you are lifting some serious weights, I would suggest elsewhere.
The gloves are true to size.
I have been lifting weights for a while now so I have had several pairs of gloves.
And the leather is pretty cheap.
There is also little padding.
If lifting is not really your thing, they are probably great for you.
I paid about 10 bucks for these gloves.

Did he??
The island's source of power is rocks that give light.
Carl gets a little baby dinosaur to take care of and David gets a pteronadon flying job.
See that!
My favorite dinosaur-character is the T-Rexes or the brachiosaurus buses.
Ever After has much better acting and script.
They think the dad drowns.
They meet a nice girl named Marion, who likes dinosaurs.
They see T-Rexes, which were cool.
So Carl and David go with a professor guy to find more rocks in the World Beneath.
?My favorite person-character is either the girl or Carl.
Sometimes they'll go black and won't work.
They both have crushes on her.
Carl and David are planewrecked on Dinotopia, a land with dinosaurs and people.
They both don't exactly LIKE their jobs.
I think it's an ALRIGHT script and ALRIGHT acting.
Will they find more rocks, and will they survive???
A dad and his boys (Carl and David) get planewrecked.

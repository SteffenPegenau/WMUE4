So I ordered these diaper pads and wow!!
Soaked jammies, blanket, sheets, all the way through the mattress pad.
We tried to limit fluids close to bedtime, no luck.
My washing machine has already thanked me :0)
I read all the reviews good and bad, and decided to try them with some sceptisim.
He has been dry every morning for the last week.
My 12 month old son was leaking through his diaper EVERY night without waking.
If you have leaky diaper issues try these!!
I tried other brands, we use Pampers Baby Dry, Huggies, Luvs.....nothing worked.
I had tried buying up a size, he's already in a four, so I bought up to fives.
They are plenty big for his size four diapers.
No help.
I am now here to order more.
I usually put the pad more in the front of the diaper, he's a boy, but it could easily put more central for the baby girls too.
His diapers are enormous in the morning, but he is dry!

You shouldn't too!!
EVER!
There is some blood, but everybody bleed when they get hurt, it's natural, people should get used to it, not scared of.
And what a fantasy!
But with this DVD I'll be able to watch it in raw japanese with english subtitles!
It's not to scary, it's less violent that "Lilo & Stitch".
There is no way to get more perfect than this animation is, period.
!This movie is suitable for all ages, it's just beautiful.
Don't take any annoying paranoic parent advice.
Be free and let your children watch this awesome film knowing that the values transmitted by it are just the best.
I'm sorry for those who are satisfied with the "daa-daa" from Disney, I like it too, but this is one trend that should be followed.
I never seen anything so good since...
It's true that US dubbing is the worst in the World.
Animation is astonishing and the story is superb.
I can't wait to get it!

I'm pretty sure that my local Thai restaurant does not use tamarind, their sauce is not as dark brown.
lime juice2 1/2 Tbs.
I bought this sauce hoping to recreate my favorite dish from a local thai restaurant.Conlusion?
rice vinegar1 tsp.
brown sugar1 Tbs.
(Maybe thats the Americanized Pad Thai?
Palm Sugar, Tamarind, Soy Sauce, Shallot, Pickled Radish, Garlic, Soybean Oil, Salt, Chili.Its too sweet for me.
paprika (optional)
I just dont really like it.
This sauce uses ALOT of tamarind, you can see the chunks in it.
)I found a Pad Thai sauce recipe online and I think I will use instead of this sauce.2 1/2 Tbs.
It just isnt the same.
Reading the ingredients, this is definetly not "authenic".
I love pad thai.

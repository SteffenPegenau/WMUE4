Successful sober guy lives an amazing life.
So what did those lyrics mean to him?
More likely these are pictures of all the girls who were around the scene.
How is this possible in the rock'n roll concert environment?
Just like Ted Nugent.
"I want to rock'n roll all night and party every day" is the KISS mantra, but "party" = alcohol and/or drugs in the American media TV culture of the last 50 years.
I'd like to see a book of all the pictures he took of the women he says he had... his numbers, like Wilt's, don't seem credible.
I would have never guessed it.
Bizarre life for sure, and a very entertaining read.
He was never a partier.
No alcohol or drugs?
Great color photos included.
The book provides much insight into the frustrations of the sober guy dealing with the two "partiers" in the band.
He would be an excellent speaker at addiction clinics.
This to me is the great mystery of this book and the life it chronicles.

I remembered seeing this on the shelf of my local video store and wanting to see it but never got around to it...until now.Stella Stevens (his mom) directed it and it really is a cute little movie.
He's such a hot guy and he's been in some great 80's movies.
It's one of those movies you can watch on a rainy afternoon and have fun with.
Love the twins that visit the Wild Rose Ranch.
Andrew Stevens shows a comical side here.
Of course, in the end, it all comes together.Very light-hearted and family-friendly movie!
There is nothing offensive in it at all.
They were hysterical.
I'm glad I bought it.
It's just fun and has some silly moments.
Too bad he didn't do more comedies.
Okay, so I have a soft spot for Andrew Stevens.
I don't even think there was any harsh language.
Not even sure why it is rated PG-13.
He really was good at playing the poor guy that keeps getting knocked down.

Its basically just like any other keyboard except its more badass and has LEDs.
I currently use blue but purple also seems pretty cool.
$30 seems perfect.
It is what it is.
(Was hoping for it to be rubberized as it looks like that from the pictures.
I've held this keyboard for about a year now.
Just so you know it is NOT a gaming keyboard.
It has a pretty cool design, which was why I picked up this keyboard in the first place.
This keyboard does come with 3 LEDs: Purple, Red, and Blue.
A keyboard with nice design and LED.
And yes they keys and everything works FAWLESSY.
The keys are pretty alright for me.
But if you are looking to get this keyboard, why not.
LOL) I don't really have any cons for this keyboard.
I guess its safe to say the blue LED is by far more dimmer then the others.
This is NOT a gaming keyboard so it does not have any stand-out features compare to a Razer Lycosa.
Maybe $40 is kinda too much.
Again, it is exactly what it looks like to be.

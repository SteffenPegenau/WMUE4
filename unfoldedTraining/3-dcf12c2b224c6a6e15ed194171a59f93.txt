4/53.
A Violet Fluid - A great instrumental piece which is almost dance-y, quite strange.
March of the Pigs - March of the Pigs.
2/54.
Y'know, booty beats and marching pigs.
All the Pigs, All Lined Up - Basically just a stripped down version of March of the Pigs made to sound like a live performance I suppose.
This one's got all kinds of crazy bleeps and bloops and weird computer malfunctioning sounds.
Reptilian - An interesting remix of one of the best songs on The Downward Spiral.
3/55.
I like it.
Underneath the Skin - Another remix of Reptile.
I actually prefer the first remix of it on this EP, but whatever floats your boat.
This, the first single, actually preceeding The Downward Spiral, is a nice little introduction to what The Downward Spiral would later come to sound like.
The best Reptile remix.
3/5A nice collectors item, but I wouldn't recommend it to new listeners.
It's okay ..I guess.

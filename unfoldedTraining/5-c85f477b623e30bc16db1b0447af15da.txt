They just squawk...
The chick with the pan, after several hits you get 75pt.
We also would lower the rating.
There are some tricks we've learned.
The chicken fishing-if you wait a safe falls for 50 pt.
I found "Revenge of the Chickens" downloadable only.
No disc available.
Any ideas.
We can't get the chick in the stove.
I think it is similar.
We love this game.
There isn't any blood or guts.
My 3y/o and 7 y/o love it.
The kite is 25pt, hit the falling chick for 50 more.
Shoot the flash cards for pts.

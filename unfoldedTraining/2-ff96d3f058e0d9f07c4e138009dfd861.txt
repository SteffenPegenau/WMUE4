I'd worry my art work would come out too blah, or maybe soggy.
It might be good in a hospital or nursing home setting as it is restful is my only thought.
Thank God a Sade album was included in the gift package along with this one!
This just isn't me.
Another reviewer mentioned that if you were an artist, you might like painting to this.
However, I feel as if I'm underwater in Atlantis while listening to it.
If you are thinking of buying this as a gift for someone, keep looking, is my advice.
What age person likes this music?
I can't say this is terrible music because it isn't.
You could carry parts of it right over to your funeral too because sections sound like underwater dirges.
I AM an artist and I can't imagine painting to this as it is too blah.
I notice there are 3 used ones already for sale on this page which doesn't hugely surprise me.
That's how it came to me.
Is this New Age music?
If it is, I don't think I'm going to be a fan of it.

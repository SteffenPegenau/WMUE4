Where is "Brody" and "Hooper"?
We Don't need a bigger boat!
This boat is tremendous.
Beautiful workmanship in this model, so many details.
It fits perfectly across the top of my computer monitor.
As an artist, I can "get away with it".
I totally suggest getting one of these for the fisherman in your life!
I LOVE IT.
I have my McFarlane "Orca" sitting atop my computer monitor at work.
I only have one question.
I have the little "Quint" in the sharks mouth.
McFarlane, you did it again...great stuff!
A little tenderizing, and down ya go!
They get eaten?
It's fun to watch the surprised look on peoples faces when they come in to my office.

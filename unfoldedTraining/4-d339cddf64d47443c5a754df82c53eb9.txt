But if you aren't a big fan of Sonic, stay away from this.
Let me start by saying that this show is great!
Pure Chaos (and episode that will kick of the new season of Sonic X this Fall.
Chaos Control Freaks2.
Let me tell you, this episode is based on Sonic Adventure)Though, many things bring this down.1.
It's 4Kids, which means chessy puns and cruddy dialouge.2.
The storyline is half decent, rarely seen in 4Kids's shows.
Perfect for any Sonic fans, young and old.
Voice acting gets annoying.3.
Most people think the first season sucks.
Missile Wrist Rampage4.
Sonic to the Rescue3.
If you love Sonic, you will absolutuley love this.Episodes in Volume 1 include....1.
Most people don't know why they stuck Chris in the show.4.
Though after the second season, they will show episodes based on Sonic Adventure (one included in volume 1), Sonic ADventure 2, A Team Chaotix Episode, and episodes based off Sonic Battle.So if you like Sonic, get it.

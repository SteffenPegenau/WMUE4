If you want results then Cathe is for you!
I've been doing her DVDs for about 2 months and I'm seeing GREAT results!!!
!Imax 2 is also Excellent.
Some of the step routines are pretty advanced.
It's also doable as I believe is only 50 min.
This is a cardio workout that consists of 10 intervals.
I have so much fun with this workout!
This is more of an intermediate workout.
!
The music is uplifting and the routine is plain fun!!
long.
Cardio & Weights is my favorite Cathe's DVD.
Now this DVD is TOUGH... it will definitely test your cardio capacity.
Cathe does cycles of cardio using the step and also weights.
I love doing IMAX2 on Saturday mornings when I well rested :)Cathe definitely puts together the BEST workout DVDs.

INCREDIBLE stalk scenes.
Adrenaline-pounding, tension filled chase scenes best describe the movie.2.
Great Actor.
I know this HAS to sound incredibly weird....as most people really dislike this movie as compared to the original.
Add the fact that Halloween 2 was 3 years later but supposedly on the same night, and we have a 22-year old Jamie Lee Curtis playing someone who is 17.
Why?
Jamie Lee Curtis.
But in my opinion, it's the best in the series.
Well..read on:1.
'Nuff said.So is Halloween 2 _REALLY_ better than the original?
_5_ years, and she pulls it off.3.
Well, probably not, but in my opinion, YES.Matt~
Well, in the original (made in 1978), Curtis was 19, and played the role of Laurie, whom was 17.
Why?
Donald Pleasence.

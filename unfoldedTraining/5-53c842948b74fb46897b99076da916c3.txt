Just get this album.
But I do own four of their albums.
In fact, I am more a Reggae fan.
The albums I own are: The Joshua Tree, Rattle and Hum, All That You Can't Leave Behind (ATYCLB)and, quite recently, I bought Achtung Baby.About Achtung Baby: the style is different from The Joshua Tree and ATYCLB.
And his voice is in top form on this album.
Perhaps their best song.
You cannot help but be moved by this song.
Look, I can go on and on.
My personal favorites besides One are: So Cruel, Mysterious Ways, Love Is Blindness, and Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around the World.I don't think there is anyone out there with Bono's gift for writing lyrics.
You will not regret it.
Period.
"One" is an EXCEPTIONAL song.
I can't say I am a true U2 fan.
Good music, after all, is good music.
All the songs are good.
And these guys are incredible.
The album would be worth its price if that were the only good song on it.But there are 12 good songs here.
But this is an exceptional album.
All except "One."

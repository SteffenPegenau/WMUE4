After killing, maiming, and continued lunacy what do you do?
I put it on when I want to clear the room!
Sing and dance in front of the cops as they lead you away!
Call them up and use your sister's voice of course!
What a great flick!
Bette Davis ruled this one.
She so's horribly ugly you can't take your eyes off her!
This film is as predictable as grass growing during a Florida summer, but it's oh so fun.
What do you do when you have a symphathtic housemaid?
Bash her!
Oh the humanity!
And once you finally discover the topsy-turvy ending?
Dance and sing on Baby Jane, God bless you.
Take your crippled, half dead sister to a crowded beach in the middle of the day!
What does one do when your cutoff by the liquor store?
Watching Joan Crawford being kicked and beaten by an insane Baby Jane can never get old.

I thought they made this movie look bad but....................Creepshow 2 is a great movie.
good acting for such a low budget movie.5.)
)cool/cheesy music.4.)
my favorite part of the movie.3.
reminds you of late eighties saturday morning cartoons.
)an EXCELLENT animated wraparound featuring the creep, a weird kid, and his run-in with some bullies.
good monster effects in the raft sequence and a great mutilated corpse in the hitch hiker.They did really well with such a small budget.
the oil slick is scary.
don't believe what the detractors say.but....1.)
great locations.
Recommended.
really convincing.you see a desert town, a mountain lake, and the icy highways of Maine.6.)
this deluxe edition's commentary and bonus documentary are lame.
)three cost effective stories, first is mediocre, but the other two are great.2.
Creepshow 2 contains-1.

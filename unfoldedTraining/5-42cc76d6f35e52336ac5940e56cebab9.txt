I will agree with those who say it is a bit hard to push, but it's not bad.
You will not be sorry.
This vacuum is VERY POWERFUL.
I debated for months when I could have been enjoying cleaner carpets.
I had unpacked it on the living room floor and little pieces of styrofoam were all over the place.
Don't know what I'll do with my old upright.
I have physical disabilities and I can do it with no problem.
It does everything it claims to do and more.
It sucks in dust before you even roll over it.
I have it in 2 days.
I used it right there and I couldn't believe my eyes.
Buy the way this $54.99 is less expensive than any store in my town.
I just ordered this vacuum 2 days ago and took the free shipping from Amazon.
It only took me 5 minutes to put it together, NO tools needed.
This cutie little guy out shines it by a mile.So if you are debating if you should buy it...JUST DO IT!
My carpet has never looked so good.
Everything just snaps in place.
WOW!

Oh, what a miserable life it must be!
Powers, look out!
It's the usual story: secret agent shags countless girls, drinks, looks suave (He!

Yeah, the story is silly, but just grab a six-pack of Tab cola with some friends, sit back, and enjoy!
It is Dean Martin, after all.

The Silencers stars Dean Martin as Matt Helm and Stella Stevens as the token woman sidekick, Gail Hendricks.

I'm not going to beat around the bush with this one: if you're looking for good, cheesy fun, then this one's for you!
Ya gotta love the dancing girls during the opening credits.
Mr.
Look out Vidal Sassoon, here I come!
he!
whoo!
And the hairstyles.
There are some great visuals in this film that definitely make it worth your while.
Ahh, another film in the tradition of the numerous spy thrillers of the 1960s.
Dean Martin's at the "helm" and in control!

My skin was very dry, regardless of using moisturizer.
This product is horrible!
I stopped using it right away.
My skin eventually peeled and now it's finally better.
By the third day, I noticed hundreds of little whiteheads on my skin, covering my entire face.
AVOID this product!!!
I couldn't even use it for a week.
I went straight back to cetaphil, thank God.
Especially if you have sensitive skin like me!
The first day was alright.
My friends even remarked about the redness of my face.
The texture of my skin really began to deteriorate.
I just figured that it was working.
Maybe I have very sensitive skin, but this product tore my skin up.
They were really tiny, and you could barely notice them, but with bright light, you could see them.
Then I noticed my skin really drying out.
It took a week at least for my skin to recover from using the product.
It left my skin feeling kind of tight afterwards, stripping my skin of all oil.
The second day, my skin was red after using it.

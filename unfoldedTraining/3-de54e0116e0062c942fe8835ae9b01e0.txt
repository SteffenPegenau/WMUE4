Deleting all scenes with DiCaprio and what's her boobs would be my first recomendation.
Would have improved the film greatly.
Great special effects.But it could have used a little work.
Two other Ryans, Edward Ryan and Patrick Ryan were, both third class.
I thought that this was an excellant film.Beutiful scenes.
The first officer also deserves a little respect.Otherwise a great film.A trival goof.
Excellant acting by the supporting actresses and actors.
Beutiful costuming.
Tommy Ryan wasn't a passenger.
Many rich men chose to go down with the Titanic so poor women ahd children could live.
many men chose to die, shouting 'women and children first'.
He was one of the crew.
A steward.
I would also delete the class bigotry.
None of them related.
The scenes of armed stewards shooting passengers have long since been disproven.

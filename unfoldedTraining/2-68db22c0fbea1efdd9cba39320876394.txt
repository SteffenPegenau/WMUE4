But having them making out in the rain is utterly disgusting.But, on the MUSIC.
They were 12 when they shot it.
They should come back when they've matured their creativity, image, and style.
They shouldn't have to make out in a rain-storm to get publicity.
Yes and NoYes, cause they haven't developed as musicians, and need to find a better company to deal with.No, cause they have potential, but must find it themselves.

After they become true musicians, that is.I don't blame the duo.
They aren't true musicians, and shouldn't be judged as musicians.But for Heaven's sake, what a [strange] producer!
They sound pretty good in their russian tracks, but man, do they have to be the ultimate high-production-no substance-group to sell?

The album leaves a bad taste in the listeners mouth, and they need to wipe it away.
Little kids too.
They need to learn English.
Again.

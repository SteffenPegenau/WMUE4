automatically turns to the HDMI signal to view my ps3.
at Bestbuy for a little under a thousand dollars.
Next is that the t.v.
But then again I did the same with my standard tube t.v.So far I had the t.v.
The only problem is once you turn off the ps3, you have to remotely cycle through the other 3 hdmi inputs to get back to the cable box.
does read any new input devices well.
The picture is great.
for three days and haven't had a problem compared to the other reviews for other 42inch models from Westinghouse.
Since this is my first HDTV, I don't have anything to compare it to.
I have a HD DVR from the cable company so the picture is as good as it can be.
I will try to update you monthly.
I hooked up both the cable box and my ps3 via HDMI.Con - The remote sucks.
Just brought this t.v.
But then again I just used the cable remote so that solves that problem.
I can be watching cable and turn on my ps3 and the t.v.

You're feeding him wrong.
To those who have problems with the formula coming out too slow or not at all, I say: Hello, have you ever heard of using a sterilized needle to clean it out?
I did some research and figured that the Avent system just might work.
Remeber to sterilize both the bottle and the nipple.
We tried the Playtex Brand.
It's the bum on the bottle.
He still got gas after feeding.
Of course there was the ususal burping, but afterward no crying and no gas.
He took to it without fussing and low and behold NO GAS!!!!
Nipples do get clogged you know.
We have to admit that after 3 weeks of our son crying after feeding time even though we burped him and burped him he still had GAS!!!!
It's not the manufactures fault that you aren't keeping it clean.
You need both working properly for a happy healthy baby.
To those out there who say they get the dribble when feeding, I say: It's not the bottle on the bum.
We tried the Johnson's Brand.
Thanks Avent!

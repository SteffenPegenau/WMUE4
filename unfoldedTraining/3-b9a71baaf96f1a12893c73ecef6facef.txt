My favorite character in this book would probably be Moose because when his family moved he left his baseball team.
I gave it 3 stars because I've read better books.
Also I have an aunt whose daughter is just like her.
I didn't like this book because it didn't have enough action for me.
To her son Moose.
The man was holding her hand.
Also I can remember the man by his nickname 105.
If I would have to recommend this book for someone I would recommend it for somebody about 30 or older.
I know what it is like to leave something special behind.
My most memorable part would have to be when Natalie's mom kept saying no she isn't 16.
I also liked the part where the con man was talking with Natalie.
I left my friends behind but I can go see them.
Al Capone does my shirts is about a girl named Natalie who has Autism.
The book doesn't have much personality.
She's not 16.
Another part that I liked was the part where she was counting rocks and buttons.

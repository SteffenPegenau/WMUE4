Also, no way a car can crash into another car at high speed and the headlights still work.
A well done movie.
A real love story here makes this movie a very good movie.
Affection between Ryan and boy really works.
Some fun cars.
Classy to choose a 1975 Malibu (modified with a great engine I'm sure) as Ryan's car.Are there any holes in this movie?
No special effects.
Took some time to get used to Albert Brooks as a gangster, but it worked for me by the third viewing.Some fun car chases.
Has class.
Sure.
Not too much talk.
And it has some rather violent, bloody moments.
His love for Carey wins out.
Plenty of silence in between communication.
Good soundtrack applied well.
All actors are very good in this movie.
A few other holes but not looking for perfection here.In Ryan Gosling you get a driver for armed robbers, film stunt man, mechanic, all around great and loving father figure and boyfriend, and a killer.
Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan are great.

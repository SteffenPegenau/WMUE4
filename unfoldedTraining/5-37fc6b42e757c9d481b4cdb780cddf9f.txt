Everyone has to see this movie.
The critics gave it a bad review.
So do yourself a favor...GO RENT THE MOVIE!!
They probably won't but I hope they do and so do all the other fans of the movie.
!
This movie has to be one of the greatest movies I have seen.
I HOPE AND PRAY THEY WILL MAKE HOWARD THE DUCK 2.
I aslo think the music in the movie is a good selection.
I think this because this movie makes me laugh and I can watch it over and over again without getting bored.
They probably convinced everyone not to see it.
But if they did that to you, see it anyway.
Atleast it is about one of the greatest movies to be made in the 80's.
We all have our own opinions.
They might have different ones then what you think.
I think Lea Thompson played her role very well like she does in all of her movies and TV shows.

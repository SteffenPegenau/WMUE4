It does list a whole lot of things to do "now that you're 50."
There is one, maybe two, suggestions per page.
I have ordered them.
I do not recommend this book.
The title should read, "Things To Do Now that You're a Millionaire."
I know.
There are a lot of books out there to help you cope with turning 50.
But there's nothing innovative or inspiring that you can't think of, yourself.
The pages are thick and glossy.
Maybe to catch your drool, if you are drooling at 50.
Of all those books, this one was the least helpful.
Many of those things involve having lots of money to invest.
It lists things anyone can do at any age.
For such an unimaginative book, it takes itself way too seriously.
I guess I was looking for something with a little more humor.

The "Shift" key seems a little sticky.
It's quiet, comfortable and reliable.
Overall, I'm fairly satisfied with this.
The traditional layout is a lot easier to use, in my mind.4.
Not only that, but it only registers a click about half the time.2.
The same thing happens in Windows without the drivers installed.
I use this all the time in my work, and this is a big problem.
The scroll wheel is a little flaky.
", even though I released the shift key just before hitting the "/" key.Other than that, this is a pretty good setup.
It works, but it often ends up selecting a bunch of text in the process.
As a disclaimer, I'm mostly using Linux (no drivers for this mouse), but I've never had a mouse do that.
YMMV.3.
There are a couple of things to be aware of, though:1.
The middle mouse button is VERY stiff and hard-to-use.
I don't like the arrangement of the "Home/End/Delete/Page Up/Page Down" cluster.
For instance, when I type "~/", I often end up with "~?

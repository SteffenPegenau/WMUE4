It has a few updated versions of some Banana classics!
I love Banarama, don't get me wrong.
It's amazing!
There are good tracks on here.
I have to say this album didn't WOW me.
So best just to pick up the Best Of collection.
Siobhan soon jumped ship after this one.
I didn't like it when it came out and I don't like it now.
This CD came on the heals of True Confessions.
All of the good one's were released as singles.
Stike It Rich is a great track just too long.
This time it just feels like they were trying too hard to capture what they had before.It sounds overproduced.
With that album they tried to go in more of a serious direction probably because of Siobhan.
Siobahn's latest single is called Bad Blood.
I look forward to their latest release "Drama."

Good thing that guy saw Tim Burrton's movie.But dont take my word for it either.
Dustin Hoffman - was there really a difference in rainman and the graduate?
This was the first.
Olive Stone has always been criticized for his inability to handle a woman on the screen, and thi is further testament to that.
And so what if this character seemed to be the basis for every character he would play.
This is a great character study.
Come on.
And Oliver Stone as the Ed Wood of the 90's?
This is a great movie.
After reading the "bad" reviews, I can only agree with one; Daryl Hannah's acting is pretty poor.
And most great actors play a lot of similar roles.
Watch it yourself, igt certainly deserves a gander.
Carol Reed of the 90's maybe.
Come on, they dont give out Oscars for bad performances.
But to say Michael Douglas was terrible?

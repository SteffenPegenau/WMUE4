what detail.
The highest?
The included software is great for beginners.
I recommend it to any newbies to digital photograpy.
It can be done, but it's a bigger process than the manual states.
Even at the lowest resolution they are incredible.
But with a low price comes some drawbacks.
First of all the manual.
WOW!!
It is easy to learn though so that's not that big of a deal.If you have Win 98 you will more than likely have problems connecting it to your USB.
No thanks.
This is a good deal.
There are drivers not on the CD-Rom that you need for installation.
I would've liked a manual option but oh well.All in all, for a 3.3 Megapixel [at this price].
Like the other reviewers said, you have to print it out.
Their in you computer, but finding them is tricky.The pictures are great though.
Well first off this is a great buy for the price (I got a refurbished one.)
If you have Photoshop or the like however, use those instead.The autofocus is a bit slow.

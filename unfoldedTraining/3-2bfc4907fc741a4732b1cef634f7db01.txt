kinda reminded me of the zombie fish in Undead.
altogether it was a decent flick.
Oh yeah...zombie cows BABY!
this isnt that bad.
Dead Meat is about an infection with cows or something and they die come back to life and start killing people which initially causes them to become the living dead.
i wouldnt buy it but i would watch it if it was on.
there are much much worse movies out there.
COME ON!!!
another gets skewered through the stomach.
you get the point.
that was the main reason we rented this movie.
i dont see why so many people are uptight about this movie.
yeah theyre technically zombies but dont run off of your typical "destroy the brain" zombie stereotype.
the basic fact that there are zombie cows in it.
sure the makeup fx are on faces are crappy but oh well.
and zombie cows?
thats awesome.
one of them was killed by by getting its eye sucked up by a vacuum hose.
not bad for a rental.

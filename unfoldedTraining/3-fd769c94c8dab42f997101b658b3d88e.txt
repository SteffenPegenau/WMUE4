You get to visit with Sherlock and Savich again.
The plot also was not as brisk as normal.
Wait for the paperback!
I felt like a victim of blatant plot-manipulation.
The final criminal actually turned out to be a previously unidentified character and the ending is twisted with one more madman.
My main annoyance with this book was the dialogue.
I was eager to begin Riptide because her books are always so enjoyable.
Keep your expectations low and you won't be too disappointed.
The dialogue was very choppy and banal.
I own every book she's ever written.
I want to start this review by saying that I am a devoted reader of Catherine Coulter.
Die-hard fans: read this book.
The drama was just drawn out too far.
I could tell that Ms. Coulter was striving for the smart and snappy dialogue for which she is well known.
In this book, it somehow falls flat.

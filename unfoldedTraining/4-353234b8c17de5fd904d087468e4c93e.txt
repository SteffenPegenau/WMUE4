He had many theories that people shoudl live by to have a better life.
He just lived live to the fullest and did not waste one minute.
Morrie and Mitch's converstaions were very interesting.
he was also a very smart man.
He was never upset or depressed about his condition.
It was a very moving and compationate story.
As a medical professional, you have to deal with dying patients and their families every day.
I believe there will be times where I might get emotionally attached, which is not good.
This book opened my eyes to death.
I am interested in going into the medical field.
I loved Morrie's attitude.
I give the book Tuesdays With Morrie four stars.
That is something I am going to have to get used to doing.
Everyone should read this book, especially if you are intersted in going into the medical field.
The book Tuesdays With Morrie showed me how it is going to be.

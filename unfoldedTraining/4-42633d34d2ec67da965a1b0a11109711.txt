GREAT PURCHASE!
It has been a month with no word on the bag.
This bag is GREAT!
I do agree with everyone else.
The company wouldn't even replace the bag, I had to go to the store I bought it at.
The price is right.
!
They are made a little bit better.
I love how it attaches to the stroller.
I have 2 kids, a 2 1/2 year old and a 3 month old.
I would have purchased this one over that one in a heartbeat, had I seen it first.
For as cheap as it was, if this one falls apart, I'll just buy a new one.
I paid a little under $200 for it.
Everything and more fits in the bag.
I am going to purchase the stroller attachment for the Petunia Picklebottom bag.
I have only had it for 3 days.
I had an Emily Stork Sak.
I only gave it 4 stars because mine seems to be falling apart already.

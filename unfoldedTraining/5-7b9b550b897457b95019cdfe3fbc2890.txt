But they are from Texas.
Why aren't people talking about these guys?
I really hope that more people can experience this band live.
My favorite song is "Your Eyes Are Liars."
If they were from Toronto maybe people would say this is the next Radiohead.
It's very hot today.
This record is somewhere between indie classic and major blockbuster.
Spread the word.
All the songs are solid and it's a unique sounding band.
I saw them live in San Francisco and they were a great live band too.
So they have a Next Big Thing vibe.
Every song is really great.
This is a great album by a totally unknown band.
I heard this album and was stunned.
I hope to see them more.
Maybe that is holding them back?
I guess they already opened for Arcade Fire, and blew them off the stage.
Sound Team is the band of the future.

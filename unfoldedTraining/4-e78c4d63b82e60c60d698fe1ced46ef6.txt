This volume one collection is might fun indeed.
All of the hits are on here.
Some times you swear it was Peter doing it.
Volume 2 is even better.
Anyways, this is a great collection.
Every thing after Cetera left is not worth buying.
He has a brilliant voice and gave the success to the band.
They replaced him with Jason Scheff.
It was Cetera who lead the band into the greatest success they've ever seen and, by the way, haven't seen much of since he left.
I guess the band knew they needed a 'voice'.
It is easily one of the most instantly recognizable voices in music.
One is reminded how great and powerful Peter Cetera's voice is.
It's nostalgic and fun.
It's kind of funny at how much Scheff sounds like Cetera.
If you diss Cetera, you diss the band in every form it's come in.
It's almost mind boggling at how much Cetera gets bashed on other pages.

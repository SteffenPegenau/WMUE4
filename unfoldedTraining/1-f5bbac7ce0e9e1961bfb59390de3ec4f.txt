The description on the cover is totally false and misleading.
No more The Method for me!
I have tons of fitness videos and have never bought one as bad as this.
BIG mistake!
This video is awful.
Another awful video.
I also bought The Method-Step Up To Dance and don't like that one either.
No advance practice steps.
No cuing.
I don't want to spend hours and hours trying to get the steps so I can get my workout in.
In fact,it wouldn't give a decent workout, even if you could do all of the dance steps.
If I could have rated these videos with ZERO stars, I would have!
I am fairly coordinated and can do other dance fitness videos, but this was beyond me.
I also made the mistake of buying this video before reading comments from others.
Don't waste your money!

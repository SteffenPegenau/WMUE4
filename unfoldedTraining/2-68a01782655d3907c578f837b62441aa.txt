It has a chapter on testing TVs.
It does talk about IC near the end of the book.
Its a 3rd edition: copy write 1993.
On using the old picture tube with vacuum tubes.
On page 194 it shows a illustration on building your own Vaccuum tube tester.
If you can find a TV that still uses tubes.
Which uses the older type scopes.
Since 1993.
(No color or B & W pictures) Which, where a little cartoonist looking.
Which is out of date.
It devotes a whole chapter on using a oscilloscope.
After reading this!
From Front to back.
On volt meters.
The first thing I did notice was the illustration.
This field has widen on the type of meters in the market now.
It has a whole chapter.
I would rate this in my opition as a not buy!
It also has a page on 185 on testing Phono Cartridges with a scope.
This book has not kept up with changes in the eletronics field.

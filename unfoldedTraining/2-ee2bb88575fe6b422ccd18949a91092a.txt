I've read this one a million times before by a million different authors.
Wasn't likable in the very least.
Except the end.
She's a great storyteller when she's telling an original story.
I could have written it myself word for word after reading only the first chapter.
I believe Flagg has an excellent grasp on small town America.
The "good" characters were too good.
The "bad" characters were too bad.
I thought it was too cheesy.
I wouldn't subject ANYONE to that ending.
Oh, God, totally one dimensional character.
There wasn't one word or action in this book that wasn't predictable.
Gerry, the nerdy doctor.
I thought the mystery behind Dena's mother was so lame, I put the book down with 30 pages to go and didn't touch it for days because I was so disappointed with that revelation.
I loved "Fried..." and "Daisy...", and enjoyed parts of "Welcome..." However, my overall impression of the book was less than favorable.
Loved Aunt Elner, though.

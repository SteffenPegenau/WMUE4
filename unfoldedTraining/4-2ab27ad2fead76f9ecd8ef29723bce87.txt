What's not to like here?Essential songs: Whip It.
Ahh, Devo...What to say about our glorious nerds?
Had to pleasure of seeing the original line up back in the day (New Years Eve in San Francisco 1981 or so) and they kicked ass.
Hilarious lyrics.
If you dig it, buy this.
And this is the album they were touring on, riding on the back of "Whip It.
Gates of Steel.If you know Devo, you love this.
The occasional killer guitar riff.
"Crazy synth lines.
If not, move along.Added bonus: Devo's complete LIVE EP tacked onto this album (which I still have on vinyl somewhere, I think) which shows that Devo could actually ROCK live!My wife just rolls her eyes when I play this.
But my kids dig it.I say "Whip it.
Girl U Want.
Techno beats before techno was techno.
Whip it good."
If you're thinking about trying out Devo, play the sample of Whip It.

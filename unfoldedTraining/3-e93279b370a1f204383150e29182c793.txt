Al is really scary sounding...so thats good.
Ok the "music" is good... but for the love of all things holy!!
But two albums of this crap, and most people, no matter how much they hate Bush, are going to be sick of it.For 2006, I have to say the new TOOL album is a much better pick than this.
But its still a fun album.
The profits made from this work will go towards Al adopting as many african children as possible.
I dont care who you vote for.

Great!
I just HATE bands and actors who think they need to be all political.
If you have a complaint, fine write one or two songs.
But the message....GOD..
The actual music is fun and all.
His "lyrics" are starting to sound around as mundane as these little whining skater bands complaining about thier mom and dad.I'm with the old dude who poster earlier.
Just play your music.
wheeeeee!!!
THE MESSAGE.
Wonderful!
we get the freekin point.. you dont like Bush.

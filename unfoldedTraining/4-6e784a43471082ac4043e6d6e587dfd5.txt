It was not a disaster as I thought it would be.
This album is a must buy for Bon Jovi fans.
But lets just hope that they return to what made them great.
It mixes good old Bon Jovi rock with country.
It's not their best album, that slot goes to Keep the Faith, but it is a very good CD.
But when I listened to tracks like "Lost Highway", "Summertime", etc.
Bon Jovi still rocks, even when they explore their country side.
Bon Jovi is the greatest band ever in my book, I mean, I'd still buy their albums, even if they went hip hop or rap!
Good old hard rock!
There is a rock feel to the songs, but just with a little extra twang.
I guess for a band that has lasted since 1984,you have to explore some new areas.
I really hope for the next album, they'll return to rock.
When I recieved Lost Highway, I was terrified about how country Bon Jovi had gone.
I was surprised.
But I must say Lost Highway was not a dissapointment.

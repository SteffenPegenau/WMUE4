It broke the usual format.
The combination of everything together was the very essence of this movie.
The fake ads were the best part for me.
If they would have cut it in two but left all the fake trailers and movie ads, ect.
This was a stupid move.
This is a TRAVESTY!
it won't be the roller coaster ride that it was in the theater.
If they would have left it alone I think it would have made up some of the money in dvd sales, but now...
But now it has been cut up and RUINED!
I was counting down for it to come out on dvd but when I heard this I was FURIOUS!
I could overlook the 2 dvd format and it could still be great.
Yeah it bombed at the box office but that is because it was too cool for the average idiot!
QT and RR are usually excellent but this is ridiculous.
That was the beauty of the movie.
Now without the fake ads, ect.
It was so much fun!
I'll look for a bootleg of the original!
The original Grindhouse was one of the best movies EVER.

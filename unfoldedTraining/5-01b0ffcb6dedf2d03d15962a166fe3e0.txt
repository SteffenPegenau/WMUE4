I can ashure you that!
I have learend about it in school and so, but I never seemed to listen about it.
Its somhow different from outher King book, but still its great.
Finaly my aunt had order it from someplace.
This book will make you laught, cry, and be scared for daylight!
This book made me cry!
I had wanted it for long, but not in Norwegian.
Its not many times King has made me cry, but he did.
Its fritening in the way, coz I had never thought of the vietnam war in a way King write about it.
I got this for xmas 2001.
!
I learned something from this book, how awful the vietman var was.
I cant wait to see the movie, or start riding it again!
Its sad in a way, still its fritening, and that all mixed together makes a relly relly great book, its recomented for you people out there who understand the "Reading for fun" term!!
This is a great book!

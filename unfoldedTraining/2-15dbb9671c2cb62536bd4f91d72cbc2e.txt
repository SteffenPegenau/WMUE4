Though Dave rocks hard solo...
A mess from the start to end.
I interviewed Dave a couple of times & saw him live.
Just talk to fill the musical gaps which when he plays are EMPTY by himself.
He still fall's short.
I am a KINKS fan since they first hit the radio in the early '60s.
Do not hammer me with this brief review.
Ray's STORYTELLER is a DRASTIC DISSAPPOINTMENT.
I saw them about 15 times.
NEED EACH OTHER.
HE KICKED ... & ROCKED HARDER THAN THE KINKS AT THE TOP OF THEY'RE GAME!
BOTH DAVIES BROS.
Ray is totally lost without Dave and STORYTELLER proves it.
GOD SAVE THE KINKS OR BETTER YET... RAY & DAVE!
Let's get FACE TO FACE.

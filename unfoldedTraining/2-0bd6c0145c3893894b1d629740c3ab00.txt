It was Carousel.
It is not made to sing the wonderful songs of Laura Nyro or Randy Newman.
Ms. McDonald's voice is a gift made for the musical theater.
No I don't want to hear anyone, even Ms. McDonald, do a cover of the novelty song Bein' Green.
I still am.
I love Ms. McDonald's voice.
Up until now, that claim wasn't ever tested.
I imagine the same thing will happen here.
Ever since then, I've been mesmerized by her voice.
I first heard her sing an ingénue role in Lincoln Center.
But this album is a mess.
She stole the show in my and a lot people's eyes.
Lord knows other great singers have made clunkers of albums like this and returned to fine form with the next effort.
Let's back up a bit first.
There are certain singers, Ms. McDonald being one of them, that I've often said are so good that I'd pay to listen to them sing a phone book.
It's well produced and arranged, but the song choice is bizarre.

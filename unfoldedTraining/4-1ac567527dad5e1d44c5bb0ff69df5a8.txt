And I've read that they are working on a script for "Thor 2".
During his humiliation as a human being, I had several laughs, especially the scene in the hospital!
Not the case here.
Thor was also well casted.
Everyone played their role well.
Give it a try.
There are MANY super hero movies out there right now, and this one DEFINITELY deserves your attention.
I'll be getting it on blu ray pretty soon!<NEWS> Thor will be making another appearance in the movie "The Avengers", which comes out this summer in theaters (2012).
I love how Thor is humbled when everyone knows he is the strongest and the most cunning of them all.
The story really helps this movie be great.
But he was far too arrogant and ill-considered to be handed the throne.
I was expecting some cliché super hero movie with the usual cheap thrills.
I hope they don't ruin this super hero by making him all warrior and no integrity in the second movie.
I waited a long time to watch this one.
Most people will like it.

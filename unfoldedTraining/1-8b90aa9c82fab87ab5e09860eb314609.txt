I hope it's the nature of the item and not the product.
I disassembled and reassembled it.
The product just doesn't do what Gardena claims.
After about 10 to 15 minutes of use, the sprinkler stops spinning and only sprays water in the same direction, soaking the same portions of the lawn.
If I knew how to return or exchange it, I would do so in a heart beat.
I ran it with and without the filter.
It's in my gargage getting dusty.
During that time I have never been disappointed by any of thier products.
Gardena Circular Sprinkler Vario/Sled #31948-5I've been using Gardena products for well over twelve years.
I am completely disappointed with the performance of this product.
Not until now.
All to no avail.
I tried the different settings.
Since I purchased through Amazon, I'm not at all sure of the return process.
I altered the pressure (volume) of the hose.

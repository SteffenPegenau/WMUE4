It adds closure to the first game, but only just.
It tried in vain to close any plot lines and stifle any sequels so that the developers could move to other projects.
Okay, this did not kill the franchise, but it was trying to close it definately.
That said, this is the weaker game of the original trillogy.
Yes.Get it if you are a collector.
It's flawed.
If not, then don't bother.
Is it perfect (Like the 2nd)?
Is it good (Like the first)?
No.
It is linier unlike the first two games (Okay, they were liniar too, but they felt larger, as you could litterally wander around a ruined town all day).
It just does not feel as good.But I liked the game.
The characters are not as involved.
The monsters were just as mind boggling, but one had the impression that they were running out of ideas, or at the least recycling old ideas anew.The Combat is tired, old, and stale.
This game was shorter too.
The enviroment is uninspired and smaller.
I like it better than the fourth game and onward.

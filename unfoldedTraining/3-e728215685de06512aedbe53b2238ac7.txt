I was incredibly mad, however, at the quality and packaging of the film.
Ministry of Magic Lifts89.
Dudley and Harry83.
The Dursley House16.
And the quality sucked.
On the plastic covering, it said that the DVD was made in Mexico.
Plus, it only had 5 deleted scenes, and no other special features!
It had:15.
I was so excited to have gotten it early, I rushed home to watch it.
Ron and Hermione Skimming Stones
That was dissapointing.
It was not clear and was slightly pixilated at certain points.
I got this in the mail the afternoon of April 14th.
The movie itself is amazing, just not the DVD.

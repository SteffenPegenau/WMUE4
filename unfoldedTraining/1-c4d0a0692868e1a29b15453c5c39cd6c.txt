I have a SONY charger that works far better.
I played with it a little and just decided to take it back.
I bought this charger at approximately 11:00am in the morning.
Anyway - it never worked for me.
By 6:30pm they still were not charged!!
Most charger lights start out red and then turn green when fully charged.
I also didn't like the design.
The whole thing seems flimsy.
Come on, it should be able to charge two batteries in six or seven hours.
Popped two batteries in it.
This one starts out green and supposedly the light turns off when fully charged [although it never reached that point.]
TWO batteries.
You could plug this thing into a dead outlet to check your batteries and think the batteries were fully charged [because there was no indicator light on, which equals fully charged.]
I don't like that.
The green light is on when it ISN'T charged??
I want to know that power is going into the charger.

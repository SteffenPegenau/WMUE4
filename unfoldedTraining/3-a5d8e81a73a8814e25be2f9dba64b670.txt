so i hope that yall will buy this albulm.
here is what i say.
but the bad thing about this band is that they really need to bring more mixes into there music.
and that i dont have to deal with divorce or people doing sucicide.
and if they added a dj they would sound even hotter.
seriously the formula is working for linkin park, and i to say bizkit but papa roach has some real talent like linkin park.
but bizkit on the other hand sings about stupid stuff.
a buy the way dont listen to bizzzkits numba one fan yall.
get a dj in the band.
great to all.
i no what ur thinking how could they get any more.
he doesnt no what he is talking about.
ill admit that this is far better than bizkit.
the songs actually have meaning into it.
By listening to this cd i could tell that i am now grateful for wat i have.

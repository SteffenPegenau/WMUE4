But that is not for all fans.
They are not RAGEous, and not wild.
And that is why I give them 4 stars instead of 5.
On live (DVD1) they are playing very profesionally(This does not mean they were not profesional).
This DVD is totally worth to buy for their fan....
they looks new their sound is great and great live performance.
Old fans Must watch DVD2.
But they also give their old time video clips for the old fans like me.
They are not old time RAGE anymore.
As time goes by almost all bands are getting better, more profesional look, and smooth playing and performance.
Great DVD, must buy.......
mmmm....
Finally I got rage DVD today.
But I feel something strange to them.
They are real RAGE on it.
I've been a huge RAGE fan since 1991 when I bought their album SECRETS IN A WEIRD WORLD.
They looks a lot better than before.

Season 7 was terrible.
The disks did not appear original.
The seller either did not watch what he was selling or did not care.
There was one or two discs where a whole scene was repeated.
(very disappointed & discouraged with the quality) Of all, that is one of my favorite seasons.
I sent two different e-mails to the seller and was completely ignored.
I would not buy from this seller again.
No problems.
Season 1 & 6 has a few spots were the screen froze which also made the words freeze and sound blurred.
Either way - I have a bad season 7 that I need to replace.
I do not believe it is good practice to ignore a customer or to slip a bad season in with the others.
I am in the process of reviewing the cd's again, and am on season 7.
Season 2-5 were great.
The coverings were different than the rest.
I do not like writing reviews like this, which is why it has taken me so long to write.
The whole season kept freezing.
I believe they were copies.

One cannot appreciate them fully until they see their DVD video as well!
They are the perfect combination for each other, each of them talented in their own ways.
And once you actually become a obsessive fan (like me) and you research the guys, you'll see how talented they really are.
They are catchy, fun, and meaningful.
I wake up in the morning just for them!
How do i start to tell you how much i LOVE Dream Street!
Thanks for forever changing my life!
WOW!
Each song is unique, and each boy get's his own song.
My life is Dream Street.
They may seem young, but they've got it goin on!!!
You'll be hooked the minute you listen to their first song.
They are cute, talented, and dedicated!
They don't lip sync and their dance moves ROCK!
THEY ARE SO HOT!
Jesse McCartney, Chris Trousdale, Greg Raposo, Frankie Galasso, and Matt Ballinger--IM GONNA MARRY YOU GUYS!!!!!!

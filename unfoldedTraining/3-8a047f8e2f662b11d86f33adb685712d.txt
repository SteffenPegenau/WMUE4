Karma always comes back around, so this is my report and caveat to people about my experience with a garbage webcam bought from Creative.
It was total garbage!
This was supposed to be a webcam that could also be a portable digital camera.
I bought a creative webcam in 2003 that kind of resembled a snail shell.
Two years earlier, I bought an Intel webcam through Dell for $48.
Ha!
I don't know.
So why is Creative making garbage for $100?
I did not know that this camera was garbage and I was so frustrated that I never tried to return it for a refund -- I just suffered with it's inadequacy.
Slow responses times, hardly ever took a "stable" picture (mostly blurry), did not have good light response, and didn't even rotate!
Only $48!
Not so much.
It worked great -- it even swiveled, and made movies!
Maybe they have improved in 4 years?
I paid $100 through Amazon for this Creative Web-Cam.

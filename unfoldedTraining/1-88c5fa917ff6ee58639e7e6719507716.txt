This CD is more mindless pop noise aimed at fourteen year old girls looking to buy a "rock" album.
Purely disgusting.
The lyrics have been used so many times before.
Stay away.
It seems like the only music that is given to the public is mindless chatter.
You can't have intricate songs, because then people will have to listen to your song more than once to get the hang of it.
Listen to the single, Wherever You Will Go.
And people love it!
Please!
The Calling is different.
I like to think of myself as an open minded music fan, and I appreciate bands that are considered "cookie cutter" by the closed minded, like Nickelback and Tantric, because they have been around awhile and have something called talent.
Stay far far away.
The guitar part and music has been re-used way too much.
You can't have smart lyrics, because then people begin to think.
Dare not the public listen to something that challenges you.

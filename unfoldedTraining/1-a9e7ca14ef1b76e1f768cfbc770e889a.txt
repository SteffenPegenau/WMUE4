They have written such great stuff in the past and I was so happy when I saw a new book by them.
No matter what you do, don't buy this book.
I have never written a review before.
It reads like they had to get a book out really fast to make a house payment or pay off some bills.
I was so dissapointed in this book that I couldn't even finish it.
This book is so bad I feel compelled to let other people know.
I am an avid reader and have read Judith Michaels books for years.
This book is offensive and a waste of time.
I wish someone had warned me.Thanks for listening.
I am so upset that I spent money on the hardcover version that I am going to try and find their website and let them know how offensive this book is.
I feel angry that they wrote such trash and had the nerve to actually put it in the book stores.
This book has no depth.
The language was so foul.
It would be a waste of your hard earned money.
It is written so poorly and in such an immature fashion.

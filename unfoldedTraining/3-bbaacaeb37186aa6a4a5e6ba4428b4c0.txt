If you know what i mean.
The music is fine.
being a PJ Harvey hard die fan.
It's just too easy listening for any previous PJ Harvey fan.When she was asked about this particular one she just said it is an album where she tried to make everything beautiful.
And believe me that's what she got.
Try picking up Rid of me, to bring you my love or the innovative is this desire?.
but just not as courageus and breathtaking as her previous work.
pure and plain ''beautiful tunes''.
This is my least favorite album of hers.
The album starts off and finishes without a moment where you would stop and really listen to the music.
And you'll get a glimpse of why this simply isn't her.
If you like well done pop music you will most likely enjoy it.
But maybe just too beautiful.
Is just pure and bland almost popish music where the lyrics are just predictable love anthems.It's not a bad album don't get me wrong.
at least not her musical essence.
Nothing stands out of it.

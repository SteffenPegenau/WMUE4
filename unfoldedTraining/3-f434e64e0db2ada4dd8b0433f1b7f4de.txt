It's watchable.
It lacks and sometime completely saying something different.
The subtitle is horrendous too!
I'm disappointed though, he didn't even use the Devil Trigger :( You’re like, Waaaah?!
This series is packed with actions, how else are you suppose to kill demons .
The sound control is horrible!
So watch for that and not for deep story or character development or tear jerker or mind opening.
?
IKR???
Anyways, I still like this series.
They have the dialogue so freakin' low but the gun fires on max.
Ha.
Anyways, he looks cool, calm and badass as usual.
It’s a good fix for DMC fans.
I like Dante and the game series so I might be bias here.
I had to turn up the volume to hear what they're talking about but then get scared s***less when they start shooting and before I can grab the remote control.

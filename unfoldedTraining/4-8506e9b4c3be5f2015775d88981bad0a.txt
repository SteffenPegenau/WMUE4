I read this book and I felt for cyrinda.
We don't know if all she says in this book is even true.
I was dumbfounded by the kind of lifestyle this runaway girl lived.She was brave but careless with her life.
To be honest, none of us know Steven Tyler and how he really is.
It's her personal life and she aired it and now shes gone.
Still as soon as I recieved it in the mail, I read it all the way through.
I imagined living her life and it made my heart grow heavy.
Get the book!
Maybe people don't agree with her book but its how she seen it.
I could not put it down.
But hey were talking about the ex wife of a toxic twin, what did ya expect!
Its amazing that I read this book (feeling compelled to write to her) and found out she had died the day before.
Enjoy it!
It's a sad sad story and I cried.
But please keep and open mind because some things are really far out!
Its a roller coaster let me tell ya.

I rubbed the same area for 20 minutes.
The actual clay bar isn't very good.
I did clay the rest of the hood with Mothers and it was very smooth.
I used it on my hood and it would not pick everything up.
I felt the paint after washing it and it felt like the car had never been clayed.
It took almost everything off.
I kept on hearing the scratching noise.
My clay bar was never used, but it still didn't pick everything up.History about my car, it is a 2004 Infiniti G35 Coupe.
I will need to clay it again to get as much of the dirt build up as I can.I would recommend the Mothers Clay Bar over this from my personal experience.
His clay bar had been used on 3 cars, mine would be the 4th.
I went to my uncle's house and he had the Mother's clay bar.
So Mothers worked the best for me.
I bought this at a local store.
The good thing is it comes with a clay bar case to put the clay bar in.
The Mothers clay bar is softer so I think it worked better.

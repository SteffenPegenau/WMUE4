Why?
As a parody, it follows all the rules of parody movies.
But the effects are so cheesy it's actually funnier than the jokes.
Also, who could hate a movie with lines like, "Send in my over-paid eye candy"?
They're doin' it... Let's move it along."
But despite it's cheesy effects and super looooooooong sex scenes.
I give this movie 3 stars.
Because it made me laugh folks.
It's bad.
What can I say about this movie that has't been said already?
The only problem I have with the movie is that the sex scenes the movie was made for, really slow things down.
But if you compare it to the other movies in it's genre, it's actually pretty good.
Silly name changes (Peter Parker-Patricia Porker), similar outfits, even familiar sets.
That's why.
And for that, I commend you.
It's like..."I get it.
It's one of the few movies that relish in it's cheesyness.

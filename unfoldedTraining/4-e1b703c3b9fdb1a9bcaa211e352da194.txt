We also tiled the shower walls.
I did my homework and shopped around for the best pricing.
We just laid new tile floor in 2/3's of our house.
And a happy one.
And it does.
When one uses them five days aweeks.
Having the hose use as well helps to get around the toilet.
So I started looking into floor vac's for hard floors.
I was a swiffer user.
Which was found at Amazon..saved on the shipping as well as the total cost of the floor-mate..I'm now able to get a drity job done with ;ittle effort and very little cost.
The floor-mate cleans the walls effortlessly.
Upon checking out the floor mate.
Before purchasing the floor mate.
However the cost of swiffer products can run high.
I learned I wanted the Hover Floor-Mate 800...It seemed to do it all.

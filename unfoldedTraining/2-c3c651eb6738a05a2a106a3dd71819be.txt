Panasonic doens't have one at all (for mp3))2.
Battery life is nowhere near 8hr.3.
I got this thing for $20 after $20 rebate (yet to come) at circuit city.Pros:1.
Sometimes skips tracks.
Starts playing automaticly when you install new batteries (useless feature.)
Displays the whole file name, not just 8 or so characters of it.2.
Nice sound.Cons:1.
Can only remmeber the last track, not the position in the track (very annoying when you listen to long mp3 files)5.
When connect or disconnect the power supply (car adapter) it shuts off even when the batteries are installed.4.
Nice headset5.
Sometimes get "reading error"7.
(Yes skips right to the middle of a next track)6.
Nice display.
FF is way to slow, about 5 times the play speed - takes about 10 min to FF 50 min (sony's is about 10 times faster.
nice backlight3.
Buttons easy to use when driving (comparing to other plaeyers)4.

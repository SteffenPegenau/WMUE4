It scratches my daughters stomach every time we use it.
I have to keep a hand on the seat the whole time im bathing her.
IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!
SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!
Im walking out the door right now to throw it in the dumpster.
DONT BUY THIS SEAT!!!!!!!
You have to fill the tub up so high so the kid is actually in the water.
When she leans forward to do this, the seat leans forward with her and almost tips over.
!
We just purchased this seat for my 8 month old daughter.
There is also a sharp plastic seam in the front of the seat.
Which, by the way, the armrest is the dumbest idea ive ever seen.
Also, my daughter loves to splash in the water.
We have an old fashioned cast iron clawfoot tub.
The arm rest didnt even come close to fitting in the tub.

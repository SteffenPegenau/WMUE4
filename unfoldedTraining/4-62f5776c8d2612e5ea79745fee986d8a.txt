Yes, he is all these things and more.
Chain smoker?
So what is Daniel Johnston?
They are really quite lovely if you give them a chance.
Many of the songs on this album are about romantic yearning, one of his favorite subjects.
His music is very hard to describe, you really need to hear it to get what he is all about.
These imperfections add to the charm of the album.
Mental patient?
He writes eccentric songs that he sings in a childlike voice.
Pop phenom?
But the Daniel Johnston I am here to talk about is Daniel Johnston the recording artist.
Fans of "outsider" music should dig this album.
Although this album has a more "professional" sound than his earlier albums, it still has a homemade feel to it.
... Hopeless romantic?
There are many instances of "mistakes" that were left in, and sometimes Daniel's voice cracks.

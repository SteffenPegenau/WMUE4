The secondary title of the book is "The 3-Rule Diet."
The price is insulting enough for a paperback less than half the size of your standard Harlequin Romance.
Whites are potatoes, rice, bread, sugar, flour etc.
There is essentially no new news regarding "whites".
He says don't eat them after 4pm.
It revolves aroung what your grandmother told you for years, with a twist; eat 3 meals a day, include protein with every meal and skip the white at night.
I'll save you the money.
I've bought and tried every diet known to man.
There are no new ideas here, he touts the Zone Diet, which by the way is a great diet; and gives overall reviews on everybody else's diet.
If you're looking for something new, don't bother.
It's a HUGE waste of [money]
I figured it was a new spin on low carb diets.
The title intrigued me.
My opinion is, if you've ever read a diet book or have some general common sense about dieting, save yourself the money.

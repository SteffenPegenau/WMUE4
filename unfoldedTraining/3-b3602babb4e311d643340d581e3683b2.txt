He spend a whole chapter criticizing San Fransisco and its people, a whole other chapter making fun of Mormons, he does not forget to mention how savage Native Americans were, oh and how stupid they were too.
No stolen Buddha.
No airplane.
Every chance he gets he makes a hateful comment about the USA and its people.
That is it.
No Royal Academy of Science.
This story is a fun read.

Just be sure you are feeling open minded before starting it.
Keeps you entertained for a good while.This is not the movie.
Otherwise you are in for a very disappointing and angering read.
No Chinese Kung Fu.
I did.
And when Fogg is traveling through the USA, everything is criticized.
I could keep going.If you understand how closed minded people were in Verne's time, then you'll be OK reading it.Yes, you will have lots of fun reading it.

SHe is a pop star.
Willa was here, and now, she can leave.
Thats all she does, moan.
First, she tries to prove she is a naughty little girl, with "I wanna be bad."
Then, five tracks latter ("Tender"), she talks about how tender she is.
I think its time for Willa to stop bragging about writing her own music.
What!
Willa, i was excited about your cd.
Then, in "Tired", she is stupid enough to say that pop stars are manufactured!
I mean, one of her songs is entirley moaning, titled "Ooh Ooh."
Why?
Its simple really, she is a hypocrite.
I thought, why are there so many anti Willa fans?
Well, i know now.
Hmmm?
Even worse, is her constant moans.

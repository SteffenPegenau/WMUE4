This alarm clock does the job.
It's a pain to wake up.
It's also VERY easy to set up.
I love it.
After all the price is right, too.Updated review: I wrote the above review Jan 2008.
I just got a new job and I have to wake up 3 hours earlier than my previous job.
The alarm sound is LOUD and ANNOYING.
The snooze button is super small so you can't just hit it with your fist like most alarm clocks and fall back asleep.
We ended up buying a 2nd one (my husband and I wake up at different times).
It is now Feb 2011, 3 years later...we are still using this alarm clock!
We love this alarm...the only negative thing is that the vibrating attachment stopped working within 6-9 months after purchasing the devices.
It's light and compact enough to take it with you on your travels.
I have been using this for about a month now.
You will wake up to it.
I highly recommend it.

Done.
You want a 20 lap race?
Even the sound is good.
Enough said.
FIFTY DOLLARS!
This is the only game that I have that I can play over and over and not get bored.
The graphics alone blow any other racing game away.
But once you get the hang ofit, there is no racing game on this planet that can touch it.
Done.
Look at the price of this game.
You want your own music in the background?
You can do burnouts, wheelies, endos, and more.
Do you need moreproof?
I will admit, this game is hard when you first begin playing.
Go for it.
You want to race 1 lap?
I could go on.This game is so realistic that it makes you wonder why all racing games can't be like this.
What game this old is still that high?
But, the greatest feature of this game is that you customize everything to your liking.

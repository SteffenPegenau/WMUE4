The mythology was laughable.
The CGI was unconvincing.
I'll cover the good points first.
At least Spiderman had a good message: "With great power comes great responsibility."
Catwoman's message seems to be: "Don't stand in the way of an independent woman."
Independance is key.
The plot was unbelievable.
Stone had a horrible role so I'm will not comment on her acting in this movie.
Morality is ambigious.
Why she chose this role, I am not sure.
Pratt was okay considering it wasn't much of a role.
The characters were silly.
How can you act when you are suppose to have a stone face?The bad points are plentiful.
Oprah and Martha would be proud.
He was basically a boy toy (or cat toy?)
Maybe she knew she would look really good in leather.
Halle Berry did a good job considering the material she had to work with.
The dialogue was horrendous.

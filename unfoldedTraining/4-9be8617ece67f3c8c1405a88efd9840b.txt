Turkey Day?
But, on the whole, I enjoyed these shows very much.
I'm not sure about the episode selection, though.
These, and so many others, belong in our collection.
I know I'd collect them all.As others have said, the writing is superb, and the characters cast so well, that this series deserves to be preserved in it's entirety on tape.
Where is THE CONSULTANT?
That was a disappointment for me.
Venus teaching about the atom?
Or, Herb's pink frog?
More please!
Jennifer's dead date?
So glad to find WKRP on tape.
My big complaint is the dubbed music.
Heck, why not the entire series?
Who picked these?

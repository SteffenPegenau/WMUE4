I have a pretty good imagination and read all kinds of books, paranormal included, so even though this was a really far fetched plot, I figured it would be good.
After reading the rest od her books, I have to say this book was not up to the standards of the rest of the books.
No bonding, emotion, love nada.
I hope this is the only bad apple there is.
The problem is there is nothing to hold this story together.
There is just no depth to the story what so ever.
It was rather shallow and then silly.
I know how believable a plot is does not make a good book.
Glad I have not run into anymore like this one.
It started out OK, a pretty wild plot about baby switching, but hey, I can take the odd, far reaching stories, as long as they are good.
I like light reads too, that is what I figured this was.
The girls are cute.
Everything all together.
The body guard was a thorn in MY side.
Its not a light read, its an empty read.
But like I said, it was empty.
Its the story.
He really got to me.

Watch this movie in the dark and then beware of the Headless Horsemen.
The action sequences are staged wonderfully and are very suspenseful.
(His first film after all was Pee Wee's Big Adventure.)
How this film lost the Best Cinematography award at the Oscar's I can't figure out.
It gets slow and mundane at times and the dialogue seems a bit conceited.
The cast Burton put together for town is also quite good.
The Production Design is also terrific.
Tim Burton has always been known as a director who goes the unusual route.
But after doing the first two Batman films he began to mature and take on bigger and better projects.
Depp and Ricci are beleiveable in their roles and work well together on screen.
He has an extraordinary visual sense which shines through in "Sleepy Hollow."
It is a beautiful to just look at.
What keeps this film from being excellent is the script.
The acting is solid.
There are many decapitation scenes which the kids might want to stay away from.

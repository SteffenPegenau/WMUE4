When I buy a car, I keep them and take very good care of them.
I sold the car last year and the motor was still like new with 180,000 miles on it.
I sold it in August of 2008 to a young motor-head an he's since put another 20k on the motor.
I won't use anything else in my cars.
And when you checked inside the valve cover, like new.
I currently run mobil 1 in all our cars which includes an '08 Toyota Avalon, '03 Maxima 6 speed, and an '02 accord.
My most experience with Mobil 1 was on my 1995 Eagle Talon TSi turbo which I bought new.
The cams had no wear.
I also extend the drain intervals to 7-10k.
I break in the new cars with dino then switch 'em to Mobil 1.
that's some good oil.
200k on a turbo 4g63?
I used Mobil 1 from about 8k miles on.
Even the turbo was still like new.
The accord has 140k on it, still running like new.
Seals on the motor never leaked.

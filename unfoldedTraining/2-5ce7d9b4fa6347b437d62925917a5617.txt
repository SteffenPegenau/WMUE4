I refused to see this movie at the theater.
Well, I guess a mediocre movie deserves an equally mediocre DVD.
Mainly because everyone told me, "you have to see it, it is so awesome!"
I did however, enjoy the last hour of the movie.
What about deleted scenes or a behind the scenes documentary?
But, idiotic dialogue and an uninspired performance from Dicaprio sunk this movie for me.
Thats all we get?
Where is the directors commentary?
It was a little better than I expected, but thats not saying much.
A Theatrical trailer?
Finally, When the video was released I watched it.
And I have to say that the last time Dicaprio was really good was in "Gilbert Grape."
Nothing could be this good.
I thought about purchasng the DVD but WHY?
There are almost no extras on this disk!
The special effects were phenomenal.

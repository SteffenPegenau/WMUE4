The animals are helping us.
I love this book for many reasons.
Long live animals!!
They are stronger.
Here are 2.
We are bad!!!!!
We Could use computers still, but other things we are capable of selling.
I learned a lesson.
Why can't we?
They are the superior ones, not us.
And I love the descriptive way that George wrote this book.
All we are doing is just destroying this planet.
Humans are the most dangerous animals on this planet.
Don't you realise that we need animals to survive?!
(This book is a retelling version of dictatorship and communism.)
!People should realise that the Indians lived without machinery.

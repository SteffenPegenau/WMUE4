But on this one, I just am not quite as impressed.
ridiculously so.
That album... was incredible.
All of that said, Stoupe (the producer) is just the best ever at what he does.
There is nothing left to say.
Well, even that has a string or two attached.
Vinnie, well, he just doesnt seem as raw.
He's getting more talented as an MC, but his subject matter isnt keeping up, so it seems a litte strange.
In my opinion, they will never surpass Visions.
Listen to both mixes of "On the Eve of War," and you will recognize that he is the best.
Pick up this album, f'sho.
As in, not fair to every other rapper in JMT's sub-genre (I dont have a name for it, but you know what i mean- Canibus, Immortal Tech, Jean Grae, Murs in a really bad mood).
But not their best.
These two are RIDICULOUS.
But it is their 3rd best work- get Visions of Gandhi and Violent by Design first.

(I cracked up when I saw that, not that there's anything funny horses die).And another thing!
That was my favorite scene, hands down.
Now, no offense to the people who made it, but this was the most disappointing film since...(twenty seconds later)...since...Anyhow, I didn't like it.
Actually, I thought it was more comedy than horror, such as the scene my friends and I have dubbed "The Suicidal Demon Horse Scene!"
It really ticks me off.
I expected a dark, terse, exciting horror film.
I was near the end of the movie, and Rachel (was that her name?)
!Is "Ringu" better?
Suicidal Demon Horse!
Instead, I got this.
was trapped in the well, and she finds (spoilers) and I'm like "WHY THE HECK DID YOU WATCH THAT STUPID TAPE IN THE FIRST PLACE!?
Wait, no...
"There were really two things I liked.
The premise (inspired idea) and the scene where we see the video.
People in horror movie's are SO STUPID.
It didn't scary me at all (okay, the scene with Noah, Samara, and the TV was a LITTLE bit creepy).

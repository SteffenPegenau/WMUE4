In this film he's a crook, Drake.
Take Paul Logan for example.
No, they aren't great films, or even very good, but they do have quite a bit of humor.
In conclusion, good Saturday fare, and at a decent price.Pegleg
I think they took a crew to Hawaii, made a couple of films and stayed around to do some porn as well.
This film, and it's "sequel" Komodo vs. Cobra, should be seen together.
There are identical lines between the military general and his foil in both films.
Glori-Anne Gilbert and Ted Monte are also in both films.
In the sequel, he's Major Frank, a short-lived victim.
I recognized him right off the bat as a porn actor.
Komodos.Know what I think?
And of course the house is in both, along with the poorly done cgi(?)
What a great voice, and oddly, he was there for comic relief as well as heroism.Anyway, both films are about a 3, just for the humor, T&A; (in this one) and comedy.
Just my opinion.The best thing in KVC was Michael Pare.
It raises the humor value.

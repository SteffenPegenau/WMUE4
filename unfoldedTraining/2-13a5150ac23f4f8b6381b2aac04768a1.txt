Avoid the hype of this band.
Never...not on a single song...not once.
There's a lot of great reviews here, but it's not happening for me.
Enanitos Verdes are a much better bet.
Enanitos Verdes blow these guys away with any one song you want to pick.
I guess I found the best first.
I'm willing to admit it if I'm wrong...but for me...after repeated trys, where I really wanted this to be good (I bought 2 Jaguares and 5 Caifanes CDs) it just doesn't move me.
Killer musicianship and vocal expression all the time.
At this very moment I'm listening to this album again and trying to understand why it gets good reviews.
There's nothing happening here musically.
I don't speak (or listen to} spanish.
The comparison is stunningly dramatic.F
Man, I just don't get it.
Maybe it's the lyrics.
Maybe that's the difference.
You have been warned.
Frankly it escapes me, being an english only speaking person.

The scene where the shark attacked Batman was absolutely terrifying.
It was really scary.
!There's also a scene in which Batman has to avoid a huge bomb.

Great flick!
The shark looked totally realistic!
!The producers spared no expense in creating this movie.

Batman narrowly avoided certain death.
This is definitely one of the most realistic action movies ever.
The action scenes are fantastic!
I thought it was going to bite Batman's leg off.
KABOOM!!
If you have young kids, you might want to keep them away from this movie - this movie will give them nightmares for years..

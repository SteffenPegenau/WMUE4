Up front, this movie is pure dreck.
No 3D effects on that at all.
1 hour and 12 minutes + credits.
But, just like one of my other favorite movies 'SPEED' with our Matrix-man Keanu Reeves, this movie is flat-out fast-paced and fun.
First, if the 3D effect is important to you, STAY AWAY from the VHS version.
Thin and silly.
The 3D effects were completely unnecessary, but also a nice novelty.
Every point in the plot is worthless.
That's it.
Not as good as part one of the series, but, better than part two in my humble opinion.
This movie is seriously short.
Putting the 'Grandfather' (Richardo Montalban) up against the 'Bad guy' ( Sylvester Stallone).
As far as the DVD itself is concerned, it has all you need to enjoy this roller-coaster of a movie.
The ending went completely against the grain of the typical action flick.
But, it's a wild ride that you will likely watch many times over.

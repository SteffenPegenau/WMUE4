End the end "The Pulse" was weak and shortly faded completely.
What about Clay's son?
No word on anything.
Who knows.
What of the rest of the gang?
When I found out the book was about technology and terror I couldn't resist seeig the spin King would yarn on this subject.
The book was headed for a solid four star review until the end.
Nothing.
I don't know.
Good idea, bad book.
The ending was completely contrived, as if written to meet a deadline later that same day.
King flatlined on this one.
As an avid reader I was enthused to hear of King's return to pure horror.
What was the Pulse?
You got me there too?
The book begins well enough, the usual "band of believers" surviving the "Pulse" and seeking answers.
Who was behind it?
Then the book drops the call.

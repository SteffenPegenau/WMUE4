The 5.1 music-only wasn't so hot (pity).
The recording is a bit dated.
The anamorphic image is not stellar.
Example: When Lex Luther breaks the glass map of the world, is it necessary to hear the shards falling behind me when the action is in front???
I wish the DVD contained the original audio mix.
The sound was good, B+.
The negative must be damaged.
They should do some more work on this beofre the big release.
Some of the split surround effects were a tad over used.
The commentary with Richard Donner was very interesting.
I just watched an advance copy of this long awaited WB classic.
The bass is weak.
There were some nics/scratchs in several scenes.
He went into a lot of detail about specific scenes and the difficulties he had with the producers.
I wish they used some software to clean up the problems (ala Criterion Collection).
I was looking forward to this DVD and I'm a little disappointed.

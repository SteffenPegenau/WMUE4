It's so funny, I never realized how sociopathic it was until now.
Well, it's taken me four years to notice it and it is stupid.
It's like cocaine just playing it once will have you hooked for life.
I found my self laughing as the tiny pixilated pyromaniacs bounced across the landscape.
I dismissed the idea of worms with guns as stupid.
It's an incredibly fun passtime that I just can't handle without becoming addicted.
In 4th grade my friend told me about this game.
There has to be subliminal messages in there somewhere because no other game has ever been that fun.
The drowning animation was hilarious.
Try it for yourself it'll be the best game you've ever played, but wait until you break the addiction.
This is a game that sapped away a year of my life.
I was glued to the PC without any hope of leaving and i loved it!!!
I hate this game.
You'll never touch it again...
Worms is so addictive that I never put it down.

Simon's "twilight" songs do the rest.
The running order could have been pulled from a hat.
Paul Simon is a National Treasure.
They are moving and sentimental, but not morbid.
Simon made a great decision in partnering with Brian Eno(described as a "Sonic Landscaper" on the record.)
A genius.
Surprise is one of those subtle records.
The only track that hasn't gotten me yet is "Wartime Prayers."
We overuse the term "artist" in popular music.
Buy this one.
Insidious.
The best kind.
Paul Simon is an Artist.
Those landscapes make Surprise compelling.
Best work since Graceland.
He's also 64yrs old,"in the valley of twilight," and a brilliant re-inventor, moving in directions that inspire him.

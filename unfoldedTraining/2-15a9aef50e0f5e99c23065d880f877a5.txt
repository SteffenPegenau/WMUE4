What was I expecting?
....
I can't get over how bad it was.
I literally felt sick while watching the movie.
WIN!
WIN!!
I was being sarcastic.
(If you're a fan of the genre and you feel like talking trash about a movie, this one should definitely go on your list.)
Why did I even bother watching this at all?
Love the gore, but loathe the movie.High School prom is threatened by a flesh-eating virus that spreads through a popular brand of drinking water.
I say this movie deserves the 4.4/10 rating it got on imdb.WAIT, THE GORE WAS DEFINITELY A WIN!!!!
!
Notice how laughable the dialogues are and how badly acted the movie is.
WIN!!!
Dear God!

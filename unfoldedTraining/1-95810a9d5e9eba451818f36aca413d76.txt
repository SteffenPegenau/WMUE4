The last episodeon the 2nd disk skipped really badly.
I contacted the seller and was told send it back and I will refund it no problem.I was very happy and impressed with the service.
I mailed it back on 9-12-11.
Never heard from the seller again.
Looks like I have no product and Im out about 30.00.
Unable towatch the last 15 minutes.
Contacted the seller, he asked for my tracking number, I dont have one since I shipped it USPS from my job.
Wont order from this seller again.
I have emailed him several times.
I was very cooperative and gave many chances to right the wrong.For the record THIS SEASON OF DEXTER IS AMAZING.
Havent been refunded.
The parts we saw were amazing!
Sort of a problem since I have never seen the episode before.
Then the third disk had random little skips.
I got this item and watched it right away.

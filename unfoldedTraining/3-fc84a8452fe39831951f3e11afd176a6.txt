Then I watched the documentary.
Plus it's missing two songs: Protest Song '68 and The Appolo Programme Was A Hoax.
I bought this DVD used not expecting much based on other reviews.
In between the documentary are three video clips: Circle Pit, Rather Be Dead, and New Noise.
It sucks.
Poor audio and video quality.
Why couldn't the Shape of Punk to Come footage have this kind of quality, I don't know.
It's not really a documentary about the band's entire career, just when they started to break up.
Decent quality.
There are also 2 music videos: New Noise and Rather Be Dead.
They're Alright...
Otherwise, don't even buy it.
If you're going to buy this DVD, buy it for the documentary which proably means you actually have to like Refused's other albums, not just the Shape of Punk to Come.
It wasn't that bad.
I first watched the Shape of Punk to Come footage.
I was at least able to watch them over again.
Better footage on the internet.
Not even worth a watch.

Well actually I guessed it at the begining but thought that would just be stupid if that person would murder people.The music is so incredible!
The gore in this movie is amazing!
The only major problem I had with this movie was the ending.
I enjoyed it none the less.
This movie was a good one but did not live up to the expectations I had for it.
I sat down full of excitement and pressed play.
It looks so real and gross.
The opening was really good, just like almost everything else in this movie.
Where do I start?
I had heard many great things about it.
It goes well with murder scenes.
I never would have guessed who the killer was.
I hated it.
I love how the blood comes spraying out of an arm that was chopped off!
Before I watched this film I was full of hype.
I listen to it all the time.

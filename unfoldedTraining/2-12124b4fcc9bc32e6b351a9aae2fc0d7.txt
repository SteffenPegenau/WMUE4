I've now read 3 books by Caitlin.
No explanations.
I read that, and it was so good, I even thought about giving Silk a little more leeway.
It was also her first book, and read like it.
I spent my time, and invested my interest, in a book that ended up going nowhere and wasting my time
The one I had recommended to me was Daughter of the Hounds.
Some of the earlier story makes little sense, and some of it is actually cringe inducing.
Then I read Threshold.It starts out favorably enough.
The first, Silk, was a blurry, scattered mess.
Just a vague attempt at implying that something important happened.
It keeps on going steadily, sometimes more interesting, sometimes less, but mostly building up tension towards what seems more and more like a good payoff.Then, in either a lack of ideas on how to end the story, or in a desire to be really ambiguous (I would vote the first one), it descends into surrealist nonsense.
Just like that.
No resolution.
Then, it ends.
I felt cheated.

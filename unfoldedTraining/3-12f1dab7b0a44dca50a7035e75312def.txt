That's it for me on writing this essay.
I usually don't understand any of the books I want to read.
Well today at lunch was so fun.
Me and I friends went and did stage surfing.
The book cursed out some facts on real life.
I just read the book and answer the questions in the book.The book was okay to read I understand it.
The book I read was okay.
Had to write that.
Some parents like to give this book to their teenagers as a gift.
That's what my teacher said.
Have them read It and some times they change.
Which was cool it talked about real life problems, not problems of like rich peoples kids cursing at their teachers and their parents don't know what to do with the situation.As my teacher was saying one day when we first started to read this book.
Like at concerts.
Sucks to be me!
Some kids don't read it.
This so called book.
That's what I think.

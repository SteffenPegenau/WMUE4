For content, I give this book 5 stars.
The cover is too soft, and gets damaged too quickly.
So why is it falling apart?
This book is filled with a lot of useful information.
But for the way it is made, I give it 2 stars!
It is very disappointing.
The pages are beginning to come loose out of the binding.
That is what you are supposed to do right?
I have looked through this book every day for the past 2-3 months.
The diagrams are very nicely draw and are good sizes so it is easy to read.
I really like it.
If this book was a hardcover, I would have no problems with it.
I imagine in a year or two it will be in pieces.
I don't think I am handling it roughly either, just turning the pages over and over again.
Anyone who wants to know anything about building in a clear, easy to understand way should get this book.

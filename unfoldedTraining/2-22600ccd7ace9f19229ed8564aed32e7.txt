We have owned the swivel sweeper for 8 months.
This product could prove expensive to operate over a period of time.
They think the public is stupid.
It is 14.95 and 7.00 for shipping.
They are just adding shipping as a way to generate more income for them.
It does not cost 7.00 to ship a battery that weighs less than a pound.
It worked pretty well for a while.
Typical of TV stuff and we shouldnt have expected more.
I will buy a different brand rather than give this company anymore of my money.
Realizing that we need a new batrery, I checked into it.
But hello....I am not buying a new one.
Why would I pay 21.00 for a new battery when I can buy a new swivel sweeper for 10 bucks more.
Now, the battery will not hold a charge very long and it only works for about 7 minutes.
This company is really charging 18.00 for the battery because they could ship it for less.
7.00 for shipping a small battery?

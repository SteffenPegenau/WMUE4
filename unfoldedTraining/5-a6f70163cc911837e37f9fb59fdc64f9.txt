If you don't like it that is you parogitive.
I am feeling that one iN every way and I am sure that this will tickle your fancy as well.
What can I say?
If you are not a fan of N'sync give them a try, BUT for those of you that love them this IS for you.
pics are: "It is gonna be me", "Bye Bye", "Just Got Paid", and my all time favorite is "It Makes Me ILL".
I have only one complaint (if you can call this a complaint).
The beats, the harmonies, they are PHAT (plesureful, hot, and tempting).
My fav.
This album has a great combo for the "hip hoppers" and the "slow jammers" You need to cop this album.
But I LOVE IT and YOU can take that to the bank!
There are only 12 tracks, BUT those 12 tracks are flava-full.
Don't hate on these boys.
Let them do thier thing.If all else fails if you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all!
Don't take my word for it just get the cd.
Okay this album is not perfect but what in life is?

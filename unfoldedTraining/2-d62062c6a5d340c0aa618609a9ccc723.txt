Also, it should be known that this TV does not support variable output on the sound so you'll always have to adjust at the receiver (just a note).
Called Samsung again.
Came back and had it now had a hum on the output side (going to the receiver) and 4 months later it also developed a problem with the screen (blue spot on the bottom left hand side).
They are worthless.
About 3 months after purchase It developed a hum in the audio on the component connections.
They sent out yet another (non Samsung Authorized repair center).
Buyer beware!!!
Called Samsung and they sent someone out who took the TV away and repaired it.
My advice to you is don't count on Samsung repair.
They've had the TV now for over 15 days and no update from them.
!
It is nice, but if you have problems at all, you'll be in trouble.
If the TV worked correctly, I'd probably give it a better review.
Samsung will not take care of you if you have problems!!!
Bought this TV and loved it at first.

Press tells him he is a "traveler" and he must save Denduron from a terrible fate.
Bobby Pendragon...a fourteen year-old boy with a normal life untill his uncle takes him away to a territory called Denduron.
I usually believe that a five star book is impossible, because no book can be perfect.
But why him?
I give it a perfect five stars.
He doesn't even live on Denduron.
I would strongly recommend it.
READ IT!!!!!
If you want to be in another state of mind and read through a book in one day, this book is for you.
This book isn't, but a measly four stars isn't enough!
Why should he help?
The action almost never stops, and Bobby is almost always in a life-threatening position.
If you would like to know, read the book!
He's fourteen.

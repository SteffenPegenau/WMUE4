--- He cannot turn his head sideways, and he cannotbend his knees or sit.
His hat is removable, hispipe is not.
It is a greatsouvenir.

But he is a great memory to stare at forus fans.
To stare at,not play with.
Me and other fans have waited years for this.I bought 2.
Finally!!!!
One to stare at in its box, and one to play with.---There is not much action to him, the only thing he does is movehis arms at the elbows up and down.
Do investigate it if you can.
--- There is also an Edgar Allan Poe action figuretoo available.
Looks almost like actor BASIL RATHBONE with the longface.--- I got this action figure next to my bed.

You can write it Dad.
To everybody who is reading this review, my dad is typing it, and I want him to stop.
Stop for serious, Dad.
This review is written by my daughter:It's a good book.
I want you to delete what you just wrote because I want you to write it.
I don't want to write this review.
Please!
I don't know Daddy, you write it.
Just write it for me!
Okay, Dad, I'm going to do it.
I'm serious Dad!
Dad, I have a paper airplane with an edge and I'm going to poke your eye out if you don't delete this.
That wasn't part of the review!
I want you to delete this review and you can start it again.
I don't know what to write.

She is so human--actually she reminds herself very much of me, LOL!
My sister and I exchange and discuss the Agatha books.
I discovered this, the first book, only after having read 2 others.
We howl with laughter at some of her bull-in-the-china-shop antics.I read some pretty negative comments about Agatha's personality quirks here.
I loved Agatha from the first novel I read.
(Thank goodness!)
She is definitely not the beautiful, sweet heroine of so many novels.
At this point there are so many A.R.
Amazon has a link to a list which purports to be the whole series in order, but it is not, not, not.
I have read some of this series out of order.
Some books are not listed, many are out of order, etc.
I guess you just have to have a certain outlook on life to really appreciate Agatha.
books around that I am having trouble reading them in order.
I wondered if anyone has an accurate list?
And I now want to live in the Cotswolds, too.I am experiencing one problem.
?
Doesn't really matter.

Mr. Griffin if you are reading this, intument is spelled instrument.
Must be nobody bothered to read that half page.
Oh one more thing about the Easyist Accordion book.
This one came last and I thought that being that the other one was good, this would be nearly as good or better.
Ric.
This 32 page book has one half page of instruction.
I bought two books on accordion published by Mel Bay.
That is all.
At least that book has pictures and tells you a little about music.
It is assumed I guess that you know all about music because this doesn't even tell you what a quarter note is or what the base and treble symbols are.
That half page of instruction has two spelling or grammer errors in it that I found.
A lot better book is Accordion Method by Frank Zucco.
Then it goes into about 30 pages of sheet music.
It is not for the beginner.
It shows you where to put your hand for the base buttons.

I join others who said this book left them wanting.
I was hoping for more of Dooley as a young man.
Nope.
Puny has a new set of twins, and it was barely mentioned.
And after searching all over for Kenny, he just happens to show up at Fr Tim's door!?!
I hope they will be like the first 5 books of the Mitford series.
I just shook my head at that.
I had hoped with this last book, all the "ends tied up" would be with the characters we have known for the whole series.
Why?
We don't know.
I couldn't keep all the new people straight.
Edith Mallory found God?
It seems Ms. Karon wanted to get this book out of the way, so she could get on with the new Father Tim novels.
It was quite disappointing.
BIG SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!!!

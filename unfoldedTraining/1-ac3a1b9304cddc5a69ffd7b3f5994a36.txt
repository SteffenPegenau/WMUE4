now I'm returning it for a credit.
after 6 cds I gave up.
.
The day I received it, took it out of the box and tried it.
.
E-mailed Primera and they gave me RMA.
Hooked it up and printed my first cd (one included in the box).
I protested and they sent me a shipping label.
.
At first wanting me to send it back on my dime.
2 out 4 quadrants misprinted.
I hope no one else has the same problems.Like I said great idea but the product did not deliver.
Second unit, same thing .
The logo that I had downloaded was printed incorrectly in one quadrant and another quadrant had text misprinted.
I was really excited to get this product it was exactly what I was looking for.
Waited for the second unit, hoping it was a fluke.
Hmm, I tried it again and again .
.
I guess I'll have to buy a Epson or HP to print directly onto the cds.

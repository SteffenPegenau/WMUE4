It is in the bedroom.
I will post what happens in the near future.The noise worked itself out in a day.
The plastic was in 3 pieces.
My husband started putting it together and all the parts were there and he said the directions were very easy to read.
It was delivered via a shipping company which was great.We opened the box and everything was packed very secure in the box.
We were actually looking at spending over $1000 for a machine but this one is great for half the price.
This is a great machine.
I called Schwinn and they are sending the new part.
It makes this awful rubbing/grinding noise.
I love the programing features.
I ordered this when Amazon had this in the gold box special for $499 plus free bowflex mat.
We love the size.
We found the right foot pedal was broken.
After 1.5 hours my husband got it all put together and now the flywheel is rubbing in the housing.
I have used it everyday since we put it together.

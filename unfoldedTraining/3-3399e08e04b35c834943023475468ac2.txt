I shall iterate - just FlashHelp in free retelling and no more.
My and author's concepts of `advanced level` very much differ.
Where it in the book?
Where the calculated by action-script animation?
I am completely dissatisfied.
MMFlash have en error in publish-with-JavaScript-template.
2-frame-based circles allow to create HUGE quantity of unique effects.
Where trigonometry?
In the book I have not found any of.
Using animated mask level have MANY limitations.
Any limitations is not circumscribed.
Using action-script has HUGE quantity of limitations and usages.
Regards.
Because of this error the FSCommands do not work in NN.
Where it in the book?

Also, my cousin really likes horses and read all the pony Pal books, and she says Connemiras, wich is Pam's ponie's breed, do not exist!
I was real disapointed by this book.
It is silly.
They say Annie is too big for Acorn the pony but in picture she fits on him fine.
If it werre not for those mistakes and it was not sad I would actualy like this book.
They all have ponies who are friends also.
;)
Here is why I did not like this book.
One more problem: if the book is supposed to take place on a ranch in Collorado, why do the pony pals ride English style?
first let me tell you waht it is about.
So maybe it aint too bad!
I bought this book with my mom because I like horses.
There are three girls called Pam, Annie and Lulu.
So how is Lightning a Connemira?
Then Lulu must move to africa and Pam gets a Thoroubred Show jumper called Starfire and Annie is too big for Acorn.
They dont ride English in Collorado!
Anyway, that is why I didnt like this book.

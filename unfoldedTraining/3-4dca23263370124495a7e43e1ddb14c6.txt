Tennis anyone?I must say that the film was more enjoyable with the help of the commentary and the previous viewing.
No way.
What's up with the mimes in the jeep?
Here are my observations.I found myself scratching my head and/or yawning while watching the first time.
That is the reason that I viewed this DVD twice.
Not enough of either to make this a success.
Yes.
Am I glad I saw it?
What's the point of the antique shop/propeller?
I am not a film student.
Do I want to see it again?
How did we get into this bizarre Yardbirds concert?
I do not watch movies to gain some deep philosophical insight.
I am open minded, however, and do not restrict my movie going experience to the latest drivel that Hollywood is churning out.
First on my own, then with the help of the commentary track.
Although even the commentator couldn't explain the mimes, antique shop or propeller.My final assessment is that Antonioni was trying to make a commercial abstract film, which is an oxy-moron.

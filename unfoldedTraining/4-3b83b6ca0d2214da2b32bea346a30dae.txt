Blessed Be!
Anyway, this is a good book for beginners, or anyone who wants a fresh look at the Craft.
Yeah, the Rede says "Harm none," but if you take that too seriously you may as well call yourself a fluffy bunny.
I dig this book, its cool if you're like me; raised a Catholic (oooh...) and now a Witch.
I keep hearing mention of SRW and bunnies.
They are interesting and informative.
I like all of her books, as a matter of fact.
I don't quite get the fluff bunnies stuff, so if someone can explain, please do.
C'mon people.
I like bunnies.
They're cute.
I left Catholicsm because I was sick of the hipocrasy I encountered there.
Think before you type.
So what if she has a hunting spell?
I just don't get some of the reviewers on here.
Don't you think harsh words go against the Rede?
Literally, are you going to starve yourself because eating lettuce kills a plant?

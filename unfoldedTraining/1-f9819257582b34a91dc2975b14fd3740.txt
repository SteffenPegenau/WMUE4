I contacted ECS and they told me to just contact my vendor.
Nothing works!
And I have had problems with it ever since.
!
This was the 3rd time I would have had to return it.
I purchased this exact board from FRY's Outpost about 4 months ago.
Went black.
Even with a fan it still no longer is working.
AMD is known to run hotter than Pen/Cel.
I was checking my email, when all of a sudden my monitor just died.
but this is just crazy.
My advise, if you see the name ECS- RUN AWAY!!
I tried changing monitors, graphic cards etc.
So, at this time I am fighting with the company, until they replace it.
However I know that it is still getting power.

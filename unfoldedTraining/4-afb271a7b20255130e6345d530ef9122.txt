She jumped and screamed three or four times and even I was in suspense a couple of times.
We watched old late 60's to 70's horror flicks and laugh at the camp and corn.
Classic...
This movie was cheesy but it did have some scary moments as far as my wife was concerned!?
She takes herself too seriously in this.
Tiffany Bolling is really a cornball!
Shocking!
I bought this movie on DVD for a "corney horror movie marathon" that my wife and I have every summer.
Shatner is his usual self....over-the-top and grandiose, what can we say...Shatner being Shatner!
It was interesting to see Marcy Rafferty, Shatner's wife at the time, in this movie, playing his sister-in-law.
It wasn't AS corney as I thought it would be.
The end of the movie, phhhewww!
But it for Halloween!
LOL...Honestly, my wife and I had FUN watching this movie.
It was entertaining and definitely worth the cheap price of the DVD.

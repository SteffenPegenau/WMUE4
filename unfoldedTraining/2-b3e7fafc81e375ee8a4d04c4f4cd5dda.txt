Ms.Wick made Lily's character too naive and too nice.
I also disliked Ms.Wick's writing style.
It's way too confusing.
But it wasn't.
But all in all, it needs some tweaking.
I did like how she contrasted the two cultures but it did not tell why Lily's father treated her the way he did.
The other characters (Bailey, Evan, Ashton, and Gabe) were all too goody goody.
I picked this book up in the library and read the back.
I was disappointed at how slow the plot went.
So I'm giving this book 2 stars because it had potential and there were some good parts in it.
I did like how she finally stood up to her father at the end when he couldn't accept that she was in love with Gabe.
But I did understand that Ms.Wick wanted to tell her readers how they do adoptions in Kashien.
I thought it would be an interesting plot.
(I don't know who's thinking what.)
Then the book really loses the steam it had after Gabe and Lily got married.

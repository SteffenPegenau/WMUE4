I had it shipped 2nd day air.
The owner's manual thatcomes with it is very poorly written.
I purchased a back-up battery since I use my dvd player so often.
I am constantly pleased with it's performance.
(Number 26 in the owners manual.)
It took a month to arrive.
No need to turn the machine off each time you get interrupted.
I'd just like to pass on a couple of tricks and advice.
You only have to press pause and partially close the machine to disengage the button.
I have owned my Audiovox D1705 for a little over two months.
If you want the optimum battery life, drain the battery completly before each re-charge.To use the power saving mode switch.
( I'ts run up to five hours when I've paused it in this manner.
Be prepared.
This will cause the screen to darken and save power.
)Audiovox customer service is very slow, and less than helpful in most cases.

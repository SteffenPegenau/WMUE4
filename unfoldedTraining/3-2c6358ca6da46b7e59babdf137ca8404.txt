I am not impressed with this particular iron.
The ceramic soleplate is awesome for protection.
I had bought an iron from them 25 years before, and it is still working.
That's why I went with them, again.
It is so annoying.
Black & Decker sent out a "comparable" replacement iron.
However, this iron does not scorch my fabric, which is what I was looking for.
Example: When I set it to 4, after a bit it goes to 3; then back to 4, and back and forth like that - beeping each time it changes.
I am also experiencing problems with it heating up to the correct setting.
It does not stay on the setting it's set for.
I am a professional seamstress, so I use it all day long.
However, it is not comparable to what I bought.
I'm not sure I will buy from them again.
It is not digital and does not have a ceramic or teflon soleplate.
I really expected more out of Black & Decker.

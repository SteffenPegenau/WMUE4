It always was!
Where is that extra third of the screen!!!!
I hate to be a stick in the mud and a crank but...UNTIL THEY PUT OUT A WIDE SCREEN DVD!
I'm outragously dissapointed!
The very idea that they would put this classic out on TV format... MORONIC on them....
Boycott this until they do!!!
I've seen it in TV format.
......... WHY SHOULD IT!!!!!!!!!!!
I have to admit, my mistake never crossed my mind.
The fraction diference DVD provides is nice BUT!!!
Buy the video until they take their heads out of the sand.
BUT!!!
its my favorite movie BUT!!!!
The picture is beutiful and the sound is great.
!
i'll admit I didn't read the print that said it didn't include wide screen so... stupid on me.

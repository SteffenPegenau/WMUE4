The wrist support area is functional and the area is enough to rest the palms, but for those who have a bigger hands might not be enough.
Comfortable and precise.
The USB wireless receiver is a perfect feature and the wired USB adapter offers a longer range.
Great product.
No problems so far.
The overall finish quality/feeling is very good.
Easy setup.
This unit has a better response and far better range than MS one.
The wireless mouse is lovely and very comfortable too.
I like the power on/off feature to save the battery when not using it.
It is worth to consider when looking for a wireless keyboard combo.After 8 months of use : after 6 mths of use the letter 'A' was gone.
I had a MS Wireless Keyboard, but gave me a lot of headache and trouble while using it.
I think I read this before buying the unit and now I can confirm that.
All other letters on the keyboard are ok, but 'A'.
I've been using the set for 10-12 hours per day since I got it.

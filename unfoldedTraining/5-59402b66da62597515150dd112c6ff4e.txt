This is an excellent release, all around.
Very tight.
I have been a Foo Fighters fan since their debut album, and I continue to be impressed with their work.
I've liked his work since he joined the band, but he really seems to kick it up a notch in this outing.
Highly recommended.
I can't find any tracks in need of skipping.
I can almost feel him reaching through the speakers to grab my shirt, shake me around and say "Listen to this!
I'm baring my soul!"
I really like their new album.
He's really ripping rapid-fire on those drum sets.
I'm especially impressed with the drummer, Taylor Hawkins.
Excellent vocals, very emotionally charged, especially when he's screaming the lyrics.
Excellent disc 1 and a nice change of pace on the acoustic disc 2.
And as always, Dave Grohl is the perfect frontman.
My favorites are 'In Your Honor', 'No Way Back', 'DOA' and 'The Last Song'.
My favorite track from disc 2 is the last one, 'Razor'.

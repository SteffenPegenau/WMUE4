At around 23 minutes, my DVD crapped out and my player was audibly struggling to find a track.
The trash can right next to it.
If there is any action where the camera has to move quickly to follow it (and there is), the pixils rudely take over.
If your listening through headphones, don't bother using the left earcup, there's nothing there.

How does it end?
It's not letterboxed or widescreened, it's full screened, or rather left hand justified.
I could barely hear the dialog.
I just started a new catagory on my DVD shelf.
The only difference between this DVD and my DVD of "Boy in the plastic bubble" is "Bubble" at least played till the end.
The majority of the movie is narrated by some 35 year old woman attempting an 89 yr. old voice.

Where do I begin.
What a mess.
The right cup is filled with overpowering analog hiss.

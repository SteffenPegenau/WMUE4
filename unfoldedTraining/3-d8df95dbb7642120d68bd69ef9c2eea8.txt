I like Thursday a bit.
At least Thursday is honest with their music and there is passion behind their playing.
Which is less then can be said about those fakes in Avenged Sevenfold.
HA!
Have you heard the new Avenged Sevenfold?
Because those bands aren't posers right?
They're closer to Good Charlote.
Atreyu had to cover Bon Jovi songs becasue even that stuff is more authentic then their crappy catalouge.
Full Collapse and War All The Time are decent Albums.
I just had to write this review because Adrian Davies wrote in his review that insted of listening to posers like Thursday we should listen to bands like From Auteum To Ashes, Atreyu or Avenged Sevenfold.
If you don't believe me, take a song like "Paris In Flames" and play it next to "Bat Country" and tell me which is more intence and "heavy."
Emo is far from my favorite genre but its produced some good bands.
They're far from hardcore.
I haven't even heard this album.
Its some of the worst crap i've ever heard.

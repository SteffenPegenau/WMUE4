A quick click, and it was fixed.
Used XP drivers only.
No amount of tweaking the brightness/contrast controls could fix it.
The stand is well-designed and not tippy.
Now it looks FABULOUS, and no dead pixels!
Note: This replaced my 3-year old Viewsonic.
I read the other reviews and I was prepared for bad speakers, but they are REALLY, REALLY BAD.
Other than that, I think this monitor is quite lovely, and a good bargain.
Amazon service is hard to beat, keep it up!
Somehow the card color corrections had gotten turned off.
Then I looked at my graphics card control panel.
When I first hooked it up, it had an extreme "washed-out" look.
Supplied cables are very short.
The speakers on the old Viewsonic were good enough for occasional music listening.
Amazon delivered this in only two days, even though they told me it would take a week to ship.
Buttons on the side are a pain but how often do you mess with those?

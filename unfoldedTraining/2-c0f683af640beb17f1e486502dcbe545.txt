My book took 12 days to get to me from Florida.
I didnt even watch the DVD so maybe its worth it IDK just dont go with a seller that promises expedited shipping.
I live in Washington.
It is also more about history of drumming.
Not playing them.
Im letting it collect dust because I think I can teach myself better than this book can.
Dont order this book from Pro-Spin_Books_&_Media It will take forever to get to you and the seller wont help you.
Book ships from Florida
For those of us who cant read music I dont reccommend this book.
This book says it tells you how to drum and stuff but I found it totally useless when it came to me.
I bought this book so that I could get back into drumming.
Maybe its just me but I wish I returned this book.
I already have a kit.
Famous drummers and how to get started.
Also there will be no tracking device thats useful.
Its filled with tons of irrelevant information.This book is more about buying and selecting drums and tuning them.

I'm going to go ahead and finish this book because I'm a avid reader.
She not strong-willed in any way.
Even though there are situations where peole "deal" with certain things, but she never drew the line, it was one thing after the next.
Anya's character really was making me pissed everytime I hear the story in her point of view.
She doesn't get "tired" of being used.
She's very passive.
This book was really boring.
I'll stick to my regular authors: Eric Jerome Dickey, Carl Webber and others.
It doesn't get you attention like it should.
This book was not realistc in any form.
Then she goes on to try and give advice to the Dani and Vette, I'm thinking to myself how can you give advice and your situation is out of the ordinary.
But I don't think I'll buy any of her books.
This book is really boring.
I'm glad that I have enough sense to read the reviews before I purchase a book nowadays.
The characters are not really developed.

It is Christmas Eve and I want to drink.
But I do wish I could go to a warm and wonderful A.A. meeting with some of those wonderful 12-steppers I have known.
And will never be.
Merry Christmas.
I am a member of A.A. and I have used Jack's book.
Just keep the Big Blue Book handy.
She is truly a wonderful and decent human being.
Whatever gets you through.
A wonderful book, of course.
It's just not the same thing.
His book is intellectually sound.
I'm going out and buy ice cream and root beer.
Shirley said to me, "Why not just go out with friends?"
I have a friend who is following both AA and soon RR.
I have talked to the co-author of this book, Shirley Trimpey, several times on the phone.

I do love the ability to rinse with water after shaving though.
Contrarily, Norelco feels like it has small balanced electric motor in comparison.
I am disappointed.
I will put up with it for another week or so and then return it if shaves don't get anywhere as close as they did with all my previous Norelcos.
I do not particularly like these little buzzing/vibrating razors but I suppose I would get used to that.
Expected more.
Norelco trimmer is vastly superior to Braun's.
I have used new Series 3/340 for three weeks now.
Not good!
Smooth but NOT close; particularly on neck.
Rather than buying new cutters for two year old shaver, time to try Braun.
Leaves too much stubble.
To get a close shave I find I have to go back and RESHAVE with Norelco.
I have sixty days in which to return.
Just mediocre results, but that does not make a nice, clean shave.
I have used four Norelcos over many decades.
Not a bad product.

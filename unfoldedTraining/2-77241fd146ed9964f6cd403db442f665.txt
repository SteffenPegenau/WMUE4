It came back with the same problem.
But I need to set -1 1/3 to get -2/3.
I talked to my friends who have Nikon D70(s).
But under-exposure also introduces noise and usually cannot reach the expected color saturation.
I sent my Nikon D70(s) for repair.
For example, I need to set +2/3 to get 0.
How serious is the Nikon D70(s) under-exposure problem?
(You can test it by yourself by shooting Kodak 18% gray card).Other functions of Nikon D70(s) are good.
Can Nikon fix it?
The under-exposure of Nikon D70(s) is from -1/3 to -1.
To the worst, the under-exposure is not linear.
The Nikon customer support may tell you under-exposure is better than over-exposure because under-exposure keeps details of the picture.
In my case, my Nikon D70(s) is -2/3.
The Nikon D70(s) has a serious flaw of light metering for under-exposure.
It is true.

Looks like hobgoblin in summer 2006!
WARNING!!
I was hoping harry woud'nt find them because I was hoping for venum and/or carnage to be the third and final Spider-man movie.
There was so much talking, The ending was amazing though!
I saw Spider-Man 2 on July 2nd and was completly strested about it.
Harry finds the room where his father kept his costume and bombs.
The movie was okay for special effects, iffy for plot, and horrible for length.
45 min.s at the most!
I loved that part and the fight scenes are amazing.
We had to get there 2 hoursd before the movie, wait in a mile long line for tickets, and a 2 mile long line for the movies seating.
Hey, Im 14 and of course Spider-Man is my favortie comic book hero (along with batman).
I sat down and the credits started.
They are beautify drawings of the most famous secens from Spider-Man 1.
The film is less than and a half hours, when it could be 1hr.
SPOLIER AHAEAD!!

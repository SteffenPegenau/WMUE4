Especially if they break down in a years time?
We just set it up for the 3rd season and while pulling the corners down onto the frame ... one corner tore.
Well, after 2 years, the canopy has turned as fragile as rice paper.
Not sold separately!
Ok ... no problem, right?
Just order another canvas top.
!
Sort of like, you know .... toilet paper.
Nope !!!
Additionally, last year the zipper went on the screening.
So, for 1 year anyway ... this was a great product.
Functionally, this is a great product.
Now ... does it really make any sense to sell a product ( at this price )with separate parts that cannot be replaced?
Right?
So why only 2 stars?
Not to me it doesn't .... No more Swiss Gear for us !!
Also, when it's up, it looks darn good.

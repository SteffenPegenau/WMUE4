I'd really recommend this album to ANYONE.
This album is purely enjoyable to listen to.
Even if you don't like Britney Spears' music, you'll most definitely like this.
My favorite song is "And Then We Kiss".
I just love it.
As well as the "Touch Of My Hand" remix.
It is amazing.
It's a totally different feel from any other material she's done (considering it's all remixed).
Thus, support Britney and get out and buy this awesome album.
The new song.
I've written a review for a Britney album before and wrote quite a lot~ So, I've decided to sum up my feelings of this album in a few sentences.
!
It's so frigen awesome!
The remix for "Someday (I Will Understand)" is also really great and fun.
I love the trancy-euro-dance-tech-pop style of this remix CD.
It's really great!

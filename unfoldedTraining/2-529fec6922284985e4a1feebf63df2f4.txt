bags.
AVOID at all cost!
i put no-flat tires on it which are now worth more that the unit itself.
rating from.
most fertilizer comes in 50 lb.
and where did they get the 125 lb.
this one looks cool but just cant handle the work load.one year later:i have now replaced the transmission on this thing twice, also had to replace the wheels due to the CHEAP bearings they used.
the flow rate lever is also very "iffy" at best not very accurate due to the fact it has a tendency to move when in use.
i parked it and bought another brand.
mine now has less than 25 hours on it and the gears are strippe out again.
this is good for not corroding but the gears are easily stripped if a clump of fertilizer gets to the mixer pin.
mine is less than 6 months old and is now usless.
this thing just cannot take the kind of work it is perported to do!
my advice ... pay the extra and get a professional model.
this spreader has all plastic gears.

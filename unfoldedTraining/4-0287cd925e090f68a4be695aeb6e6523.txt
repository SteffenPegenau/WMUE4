No pithy parables as in Matthew or Luke.
Would love to see a movie use "The Message".
.
But the very traits of the book of John is what makes the movie version so good.
The book of John has always been of interest to me.
.
So it is in this movie.
No traveling miracle show as in Mark.
It is personal, in your face and one on one.As far as shots, costume, acting, locations, effects .
It would match the beauty seen on screen with phrases of equal grandure.
it sets a new standard.The only gripe I had was the version they used.
But that is purely a personal choice.
John asks you to talk one on one with Jesus.
.
I can read it again and again and still never feel like I have a good handle on it.

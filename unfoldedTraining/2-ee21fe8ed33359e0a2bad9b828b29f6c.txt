It also has a little clip on the side so you can clip it to the outside of your pocket.
You had to be wondering why you can buy these things for $1.35.
It smells like a combination of 'new car smell', gasoline, and tar.
It tips over if it's too windy, or if you put it on your dashboard for driving shots, but other than that, it's pretty stable.
This thing must be toxic.
I tried washing it but it didn't help.
Now you know.
That's a good thing because I wouldn't want to put it inside my pocket because this thing SMELLS TERRIBLE.
I'm not kidding.
Hopefully I can find a similar product that doesn't have this issue.
I really like thing.
It's easy to get different angles but just so you know, it doesn't wrap around objects.
It's portable size and almost free price were the selling points for me.
I got it for my Vado HD pocket camcorder.
It's sitting next to me on the sofa right now and I can smell its evil fumes wafting up at me.

Are you that desperate to regain the spark you had?
All I hear are a bunch of fuzz guitars and pretentious lyrics hiding non-existant songs.
When "Adore" came out you were so hyped about it and it's new direction, as was I. I liked that album a lot.
Irrevelance-fear it Billy.
Remember that little contest you had in your head with Trent Reznor?
"Machina" is pretentious over-achievement-not a good thing.
Absolutely no chances were taken on this one.
Why is it this is the only Pumpkins album I found absolutely nothing to grasp onto?
Come on Billy.
I don't think so.
Well, with the "Fragile" out the score at this point is Trent-4, Billy-4 with the clock of relevance ticking rather quickly.
Now all I hear from you is how much of a misstep that one was and how this is a return to form.
Oh Billy, Billy.
What are you doing?
Besides that many of the slower-tempo songs sound straight out of 1985, but I digress.

buy it and read.
all this and they still put in romance, but don't get your hopes up...... the dialogues though was weak.
it wasn't completely off the wall.
you'll enjoy.
when Jenna and her mother or father chatted, the convo didn't seem real life.
if u r looking for a book that you can play detective while reading, i don't think this is the book u r looking for.
once, the mystery starts unfolding, i swear, u can't put it down.
you'll be amazed at the detail in there that churns your stomach.
it contained scince fiction, but yet you could still believe it happening in real life.
you'll never be able to figure out who was behind it all.
it just continues to lead u on and on and on.
it also contained that intriguing political corruption element that i luv.
the most exciting parts r in the autopsy room.
it had a great mix of book styles.
u will honestly not be able to blink when u read the two chase scenes either.

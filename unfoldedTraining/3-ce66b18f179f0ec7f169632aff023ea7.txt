But what in the heck was the author thinking!!
Don't get me wrong Foudini was adorable.
I enjoyed his voice as well as that of HIS dog.
But, this book left me so disappointed!
Foudini's people had owned Foudini for at least a few years before they had their own child.
I love reading about cats!
I'm sorry I cannot relate or condone the breeding of housecats.
I will assume to college which would make him at least 18.
They were sweet friends and I truely adored them both.
I was disgusted really!
Then the child grew up and moved away.
I can't believe an author would write about unnuetered and unspayed cats!
All the unwanted and destroyed animals in the shelters these days and Foudini is out fathering kittens at a ripe old age!
After the child moved away Mr. Foudini jumped on their new cat Grace and fathered a batch of kittens!!
First off, her time line was a bit askewed.
That whole ending basically ruined an otherwise very sweet book!
I love and adore cats!

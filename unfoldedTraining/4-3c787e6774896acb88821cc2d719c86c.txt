She Loves it and is always "making" us stuff.
I think it took me and the wife around 3-4 hrs to assemble it!
LOTS of parts and the directions are mainly pictographs.
All in all it works as intended.
Fed up, she came and got me.
My little girl is about 2 1/2 yrs old and loves bugging mommy and daddy in the kitchen!
I used a metal file to file down the sharp tabs and problem solved!
However, when we first received it, there was a LOT of assembly required.
But look out for sharp edges where the plastic molds were broken that could easily cut little hands.
Pretty tedious and time consuming.
:) In that sense, it works well.
She got it started and lasted about an hour.
It wasn't.
Nothing was missing/all parts were there and the quality is what you expect for the price.
This was a gift to her and us!
I'm fairly handy and figured (smugly) it would be a piece of cake...
Best for the price!

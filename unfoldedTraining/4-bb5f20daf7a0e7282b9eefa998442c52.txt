The camera is clear and the video is really good.
I had this phone.
If you want to get this phone go through another cell phone provider.
I really miss this phone.
(a memory card?).
It did everything I wanted and more.
The one thing that is horrible is customer service throught T-mobile.
It comes with a usb cable to upload to your computer.
I really wish I could have this phone with another provider.
It is perfectly clear, no echos and the speakerphone is pretty loud and clear.
T-mobile will not give me customer service at all because I bought this phone from the internet.
It worked great for 3 months.
I like the myfavs feature; it save me a lot of money.
So far I have not be able to get it to work but I think it is because I needed an extra card in the phone?
The insurance claim is taking way too long almost a month.
Then I dropped it.
Be careful because the screen is easily breakable.

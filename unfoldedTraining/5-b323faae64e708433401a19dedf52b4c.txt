- She Loves me not: funny.
- Home, sick Home: Strange.
With the keyboards from Angel Dust and the guitars from King For a Day, they made their most balanced CD.
- Got that feeling: Scream.
- Mouth to Mouth: Oustanding.
With this amazing and undescriptible album, Faith No More ends his productive and breath-taking career.
- Stripsearch: Loneliness.
The songs are so impressive, that can't be defined with words, you just have to listen to them.
- Last Cup of Sorrow: Thick.
This was thier perfect final album.
- Paths of Glory: Darkest.
- Ashes to Ashes: Guitar.
- Pristina: death.Their second best album (their best is Angel Dust).
But, anyway, I would like to talk about every song of the album with just one word for each one:- Colission: Speed.
- Naked in Front of the Computer: Hardcore.
- Helpless: Acoustic.

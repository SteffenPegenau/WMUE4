I read the book.
BUT.. the writing was PAINFUL, repetetive and weak.
Maybe.
How many times can you use the words "Stylized" and "Instrument binnacle"?
In fact, I was intrigued by it.
I think it's been a very long time since I've read a book that BORED me this much.
Any chance of erotic tension was lost because I honestly didn't give a rat's behind if the characters had sex or not.
Perhaps the idea was to make to characters and prose as mechanical as the object of their obsession.
I stuck with the book, because I hoped there was a point.
But that doesn't make it good.The 2 stars I gave were STRICTLY for the subject matter.
There wasn't.
I had no problem with the subject matter.
I hated the characters, they were shallow and self-obsessed, and BORING!
That MAY make it forgiveable.
The writing itself was tedious.

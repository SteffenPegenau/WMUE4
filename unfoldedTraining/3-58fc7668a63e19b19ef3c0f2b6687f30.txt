Green Jelly is a low-class, low-self esteem band--and they write their music on that.
Let's use it!)
Green Jelly wrote that for the game.
This CD was OK, but it got a little boring after a while.
They said, that's ordinary.
All in all, 3 stars is all I give it.
Based on Acclaim's "Maximum Carnage" Super NES video game.
Well, no.
More or less clean, unlike their "Cereal Killer Album."
(By the way, did you know they first started out as Green Jello?
The best track is the first one.
So what do you do when you're running out of ideas?
Take an everyday thing and make a 3-minute song about it.
that's absurd.
Let's be unique...Green Jelly?
Good game!

All we really know about her is she plays golf and seemed to have a rough time socially in high school.
There are too many bit players in too many subplots that go nowhere.
It's as though she got another good idea, but wasnt really paying attention when writing the story.
I'll try for better luck with her next one.
This is NOT typical Lipman.
The main plot is also neglected.
I agree totally with the review of my fellow new yorker below.
The main character is almost a complete blank.
If this is the first one you read, try one of the others.
The usual snappy dialogue and feisty characters seemed to be watered down also.
What's the point?
About halfway through I was asking myself, where is this going?
I found five of her other books to be excellent.
Even if you think this book is good, youll see how much better she can be.
I love Elinor Lipman, but even the one other book of hers I didnt care for was better than this.

It was very unique and very creepy.
I never knew what was going to come next and I really enjoy that kind of movies.
I really didnt know much about what this was about with the trailer but it didnt take long to figure out.
Its actually very frightening and very unpredictable whcih I think can make or break a movie.
I dont know I guess my gut just told me that it was gunna be a good one.
And it was definately right about this movie.
And of course it had the pop out moments which every horror movie has to have.
Its basically about paranormal activity.
And I have to admit I jumped a couple times.
Espesially because its all based on true events.
I really liked this movie I give it 5 stars all around.
Though I dont know if thats true or not.
I saw this movie tonight in the theatres and right as the lights dimmed I thought "This is going to be a good movie".
I really liked this movie.
And heres a good tip, always trust your gut about a movie.

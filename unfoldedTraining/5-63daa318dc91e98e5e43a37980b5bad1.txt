Jane Eyre is not only one of the most touching novels written, but now one of the most wonderful musicals ever on Broadway.
She has a beautiful voice that flows wonderfully with the music.
She has a beautiful voice that is haunting during Sirens.
And of course Andrea Bowen as the charming Adele are two other highlights of this recording.Another person to gice credit to is Marguerite Macintyre as Bertha.
Marla Schaffel is terrific as Jane.
!
James Barbour, one word, INCREDIBLE!!!
Something I haven't found in many male singers.
Overall BUY THIS RECORDING!!!!!!!!
As well as Mary Stout doing a superb job as Mrs. Fairfax.
Not to mention the perfect cast.
It's heard to find a recording with a perfect cast, yet Jane Eyre has done just that.
However Bonnie Gleicher still does a decent job.
James Barbour has a deep strong voice that carries so much emotion.
The only downside was Lisa Musser not singing Young Jane.
Jane Eyre has a very beautiful score.

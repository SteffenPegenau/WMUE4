It does clean, does the job, but it smells too strong.
I thought, you know, baby wash, you can use it for the body and for shampoo.
Maybe, MAYBE, I would try a different scent.
Hope this helps.
I bought it because I like lavender, but it's all Tea Tree.
I think that's what did it for me.
I bought this because it's important for me to use organic products for my two-year old, and I used it too.
I've grown to hate the strong smell.
Tea tree is just TOO strong, I mean come on, they recommend that you put drops of Tea Tree essential oil in your own homemade cleaning supplies.Ok, that's it.
But I don't know.
But seriously, it made my scalp dry and itchy.
I won't buy it again.
I think it was fine for my daughter's hair.
I thought it would be like Johnson and Johnson baby wash, usable for both hair and body.Finally, I just CAN'T STAND the strong smell of the baby wash.
For the body, it's fine.

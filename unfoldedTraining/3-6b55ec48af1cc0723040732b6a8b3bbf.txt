i loved o.d.b.
a lot to love on this album, but the negatives of it crowd out the good...(shout out to my boy Javid...heh heh i said crowd out).
he was ILL, and right then and there i said to myself i have to buy his solos.
this album is too bizarre to be loved, or maybe it's just me.
i don't mean to crack on my man o.d.b., but this album was flat out stale.
it also feels incomplete and rushed like he needed crack money or something.
if you're into like extremely weird stuff that might not even make sense, pick it up.
it's not a bad album actually, it just doesn't make any sense.
does keep you entertained with his crazy voice which is what i love about this man.
guess what, this one does not reflect the full potential of the [dirty man].
his voice is INSANE.
o.d.b.
from the moment i heard him on wu's "protect ya neck."
his tone is PSYCHOTIC.
but anyways, this album is ok. pick it up if you must, but i suggest getting "return to 36 chambers: the dirty version."

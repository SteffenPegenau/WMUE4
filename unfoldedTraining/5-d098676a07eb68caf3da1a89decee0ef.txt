David Bowie and his mates outdo themselves on this album.
Bowie is one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, and this album is a must for rock fans.1.
Moonage Daydream (8/10)4.
I recomend this album to anyone who likes classic 70's rock, or is looking to add to their Bowie collection.
It Ain't Easy (8.5/10)6.
Released in early 1972, not long after "Hunky Dory", this album introduced us to a character: Ziggy Stardust.
Rock and Roll Star (9/10)8.
Soul Love (8/10)3.
Hang on to Yourself (9/10)9.
Rock and Roll Suicide (10/10)David Bowie is the most beautiful rocker from his time (and Freddie Mercury...), and I will always love him.
Starman (9/10)5.
Lady Stardust (9/10)7.
There are only four CD's that I will listen to completely: "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust", "Low", "A Night at the Opera", and "Innuendo" (the last 2 ablums are by Queen.)
Suffragette City (9/10)11.
Ziggy Stardust (10/10)10.
Five Years (9.5/10)2.

This album is inspiring when considering the direction of mainstream Heavy Metal these days.
The production is also first-rate.
I first picked up "Pass Out of Existence" but later, after seeing this album posted on so many Listmania lists here uderscored with due praise, I checked this out.
their first release.
While the lyrics are cliched, bordering on adolescent, the delivery given by Mark Hunter on vocals makes my negative crititcism almost irrelevant.
Simply put, this CRUSHES!!!
Who the hell is that drummer?
Nu-metal is crap!
While the lead vocals are grating at times, there is enough variation in his rasping shouts and enough emotional power that I rarely got irritated.
The riffs here are inventive and induce heart-felt headbanging and thrashing of limbs.
Wow!
Andols Herrick's drumming is incredible, and pummeled me senseless the first time I heard this nearly excellent CD.
I am very impressed.
Holy....!!!!
4.5 stars.
I have a serious question.

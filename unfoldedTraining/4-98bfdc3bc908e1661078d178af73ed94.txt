The idog is just a fun toy that barks all the time.
but I still like to play with sammy ( thats what i named my idog).Also its says the lights chang to sute in muice you play but no matter what i play the lights stay the same corer.
on the puse side the batters last a long time.
so i am a bit bumed about that.
not for a teen ( like me ).
And for a few days it was the coolest thing ever.
But after a bit it got kind of boring.
And the idog is varry durable i have droped it a few times.
The idog is best for a young kid.
But it stll works like new.
The speaker works grate when its terned all the way up the whol house can hear it.
The idog is fun for ervyone my sister loves it.
Becuse it dose not do much.
But wach out wheen the batters get low the idog will keep comeing on and will not tern off ( i fond that out the hard way).
I got my idog last month.

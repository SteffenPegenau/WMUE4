It's worth watching, but there are better comedies.
Sharon Tate must like have liked to stay clean.
So my summary of this movie is, it's average.
So I was looking forward to seeing her in The Fearless Vampire Killers.
There is at least one better Sharon Tate movie.
I'll confess.
There are better vampire movies.
After watching it, I'll say this.
I've seen better.
I mourned when her life was cut short by vicious killers who showed not an ounce of compassion for her nor her unborn child.
(This is only the second movie with her I've seen.)
By my count, she took 3 baths in the movie.
I bought this movie because I'm a fan of Sharon Tate.
It's a comedy.
I've seen worse, too.
I have been ever since I saw photos of her in Muscular Development magazine back in the mid 60s.
There are some funny moments in the movie, as there should be.

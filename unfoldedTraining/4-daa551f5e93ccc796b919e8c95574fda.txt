Both films have English SUBTITLES and CLOSED CAPTIONS .
That does not prevent these movies from being both fun and funny though .
Are they scary ?
Each film has it's own disc .
Lots of fun to be had here people .
not really .
YES , my man William Marshall in VERY dignified!!!
Who cares .
Yeah , i DO wish this double header was rated R .
BLACULA is a 1972 film that runs 93 minutes .
SCREAM , BLACULA , SCREAM , is a 1973 film that runs 96 minutes .
In or out ?
I'm just awfully pleased to have them both in one package .
Both films are 1.85:1 aspect ratioed .
Both are rated PG .
It helps immensely .

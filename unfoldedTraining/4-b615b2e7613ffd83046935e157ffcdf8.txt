I looove Girl on T.V.
Peace out.
I'm I die-hard Backstreet Boys fan, and I usually scream and switch the radio station-or T.V.
However, this is not true with L.F.O.
If you're still not sure about this buy, listen to the samples.
faster than lightning whenever another boyband such as sorry wannabes-otherwise known as *NSYNC (Or where ever the little * goes!)
Which you probably don't if you're considering buying this C.D.
(Even though I'll always love the BSB the best.)
(shooby-do-wop and scooby snacks, met a fly girl and I can't relax.)
That helps a lot!
They have a lot of talent and I enjoy listening to their music.
I don't think you'll be dissapointed.
Unless you love hard rock bands like Korn.
Anyway, I highly reccommend this C.D.
come on.
So get the C.D.

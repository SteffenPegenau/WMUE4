The one who wrote this book can't even get their names right.
It gets annoying.
It has nothing to do with them.
Plus it was so chessy.
One part is like Nick is sad....Nick is lonely.....He is wearing only his boxers and his tattoos.
Anyone go get their offical book when it comes out.
I love their music, their looks, and their down to earth attitudes.
Plus when she talks about the songs she gets the parts wrong of who sings what.
I just want to say that i love 98 Degrees!!!!
He has tons of girls numbers but no true love.
She keeps on calling Jeff....Jeff Lachey.
If you are going to write a book about someone you should at least get their names right.
He wonders if there is any yoo-hoo in the fridge.
Don't waste your time or money with this one!
I know everyone may not know everything about 98 but if you are going to write a book about them you should get your facts straight.
So don't get me wrong when i say i don't like this book.

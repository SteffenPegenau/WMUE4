I am a big britney fan and i wished the game was funner.
To try beating it you need a memory card to save or you have to start over again.
The game is okay but could have been a little bit more.
I wouldnt pay more than 20.00 .
It might be fun to some who would have fun pressing the four buttons.It made me pretty mad.
You have to start pressing 2 buttons at once which is very confusing.
Once yo ubeat th efour you get theh same dances but harder.
I love britney but didnt care for the game.
You get points for completing dances.With so many points you get backstage passes.The passes let you watch her practice a song for a concert.
After beating eight dances you finally get to go be a dancer.
You cant make her dancers dance you press the button when it tells you to.
It takes way to long tobeat.
I still am not there.
All you do on the playstation version is press the four buttons.
The graphics are pretty good but you have to beat four dances twice.
You should probably rent before you buy.

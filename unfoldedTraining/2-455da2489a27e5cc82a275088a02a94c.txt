A guy who trains lions.
Sorry, folks, they ain't all that interesting.
I literally started falling asleep during this movie.
Zzzzzzzzzz.
Perhaps its greatest achievement is to show just how easy it is to fool people into believing a mediocre film is a work of genius.
Whatever.
Take a look at the four men who are the subject of the film.
A guy who cuts bushes to look like animals.
A guy who studies mole rats.
It is all rather mundane stuff masquerading as "deep" insight into the human condition.
I had heard it was wonderful, but I must say it isn't nearly as good as everyone has made it out to be.
Yawn.
There is no grand statement about life to be found here.
Leave this one on the store shelf.
Needless to say, I think the breathless reviews claiming that this movie is "brilliant" and that "it changed my life" are preposterous.In short, this is a mildy diverting movie that I shall forget as soon as the final credits roll.

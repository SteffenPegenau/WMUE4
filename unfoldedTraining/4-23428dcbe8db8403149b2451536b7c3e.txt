KBUR KLAX ect.
I found that the airport listing was much better than before& when you wanted to find an airport, you could just use the airport idenifier ie.
I tryed to load up Squawk Box, and it just did not like it at all.I hope it will work when it if finally released.The bad thing was, I did not see ant improvement of the frame rates in flight.
Well, I had the chance to fly the Beta version of FS 2002.
and it took you there.
And like I said before SQ Box did not work with it.
The ATC was ok, But I am andvit VATSIM user.
When I did a side view, it looked very real, I thought I was in the BE-99 that I fly in real life.
I was truly impressed.
The hold short and taxi lines were a big pluss.
I put the WX to THSA with with heavy precip.
The best part of it was finaly the WX was very realistic.
I am sure some good person out there will get it to work for everyone.
Shooting an app down to mins was like the real thing.
Excellent job as usal Microsoft :)Cpt.

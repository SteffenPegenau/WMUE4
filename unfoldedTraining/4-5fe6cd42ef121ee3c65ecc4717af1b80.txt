So the coolest thing in the whole story is that advanced "laser pointer".
Or may be even flat.
Poor guys.
No thoughts.
Some chase, "Mini" rocks, yaaawn.
Well, may be that happens to often?
So Matt Damon couldn't save the movie - he had nothing to do, to play, but a couple of tricks.
And, by the way, those attempts to put Slavic languages in the movies are boring too.
Even no humour.
No feelings.
That wasn't a brand new idea - of making a movie about super-spy lost his memories.
You know, a super-mega-hyper-absolute-spy risks a lot, if he tries to use a passport with a senseless bunch of cyrillic letters instead of name.
What a shame.
It's pale.
(In Russian translation they called it "microfilm".
Ugh.)
Boring and predictable.

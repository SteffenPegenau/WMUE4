LOL ANYWAY, THIS MOVIE IS WHAT I WOULD CALL CUTE AND SUSPENSFUL.
:-)
BUT THE LOOK ON THE GIRLS FACE IN THE MOVIE, SHE DIDN'T THINK SO.
COOL!
BUT AS CARRIE'S MOTHER SAID...
HORROR COLLECTORS, YOU WOULD LOVE THIS MOVIE WITH YOUR OTHERS.
THERE WAS THIS SCENE IN THE MOVIE WERE CHUCK CONNERS THREW THIS DUMMY HEAD OVER THE FENCE AND IT OPENEND IT'S HUGE MOUTH YELLING "MOLLY" I THOUGHT THAT WAS FUNNY.
CHUCK CONNERS LIKE SISSY SPACEK HAD THE POWER TO MAKE THINGS MOVE OR CHANGE.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT, NEXT & NEXT.
(TELEKINESES) I THINK THAT HOW YOU SPELL IT.
OVERALL THE MOVIE IS PRETTY GOOD.
CHUCK CONNERS/RIFELMAN IN A HORROR MOVIE?
THAT KINDA BOTHERED ME.
ANOTHER SCENE WAS THE PLASTERING OF A GIRLS FACE BEING COVERED COMPLETLY.
SMOTHERING AND ALL?
THAT STRANGE MUSIC IN THE BEGINING IS DISTURBING TOO!
I LIKED IT!
I LIKED IT!

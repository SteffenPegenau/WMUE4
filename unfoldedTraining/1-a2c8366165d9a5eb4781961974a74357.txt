WWI biplanes hanging on their props???
One would have been plenty.The story was sappy.
Try "Flight Simulator".
"Flyboys" stalled on climb out, went into a flat spin, and augured deep into the depths of movie flops!
Landing a biplane in shell cratered "no man's land" in the heat of battle to save a buddy who has his hand (not his arm, his legs, his torso, but just his hand) trapped under the wing of his crashed plane??
She told me it is based on the box office record of the film.
I was hoping for something on the order of "The Blue Max".
That's realism?
Climbing 90 degrees??
The acting just so so.
I asked the clerk at the video store how they determine the number of videos to buy for rentals.
The aerial sequences were much like a video game.
She had 2 Flyboys.
?There wasn't much believable about this film.
A third of the way through the movie I fast forwarded through all scenes except the dogfights.

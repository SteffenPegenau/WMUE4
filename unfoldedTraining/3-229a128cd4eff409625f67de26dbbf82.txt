I loved seeing Susanna Hoffs on the Tonight Show with Joan Rivers.
Susanna had the all-time greatest answer!

GREAT ANSWER!
The Bangles, not unlike their namesakes, The Beatles, evolved.
"Different Light" was a vast improvement on this, their debut, and "Everything" topped them both.
Joan asked Susanna what her musical influences were.
This evolution continues to this day.

All of the reviews for this album seem to say the exactly the same thing: That "All Over the Place" is the Bangles best album, presumably before they "sold out".
"Doll Revolution" is better than all three of the 80's albums combined.The Bangles are one of my all-time favorite groups.

Hardly admirable.
His entire motivation is REVENGE.
First, the "hero" boy, Nathanial, is a self serving creep.
Ugh.
.
This book is a near hit due to its incredible creativity, but misses due to two main mistakes.
Loved him.
The second problem with this book is that it's incredibly wordy.
.
I kid you not!
I recommend it if you like long, wordy novels with revengeful, self serving heroes.
A good editor should have shortened it to heighten the tension and excitement.
So .
They're both egotistical, revengeful creeps.)
(I didn't see Nathanial as much better than the bad magician.
Cut to the chase.
When Nathanial attends a fancy event, the book spends four pages describing the drive there and PARKING!
There was a paragraph-long description of a door (yawn).
I didn't want to cheer for him and wouldn't have even minded if he failed in his task of stopping the bad magician.
The djinni is great, however.

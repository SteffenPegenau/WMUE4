I have been a long time maiden fan and this album is incredible as always, and it has many positives.1.
I love Maiden, they are my favorite band, but they have beaten the 1-3-7 chord changes into the ground.
Especially Nicko's Drums 2.
The best Tracks are "The Silent Planet" "The Mercanary" "Ghost and the Navigator" and "Wickerman"Here are my complaints.1.
4.
Lacking Diversity!
The production is the best I have ever heard on a maiden album.
Lyrically it can be kind of incoherent at times.I still love the Album and Maiden has not sold out yet so UP THE IRONS to all you Maiden Heads out there!
I wish I could have given this album 4 and half stars but alas that was not available.
Its more progressive, Maiden has two 9 minute songs on this album.
They wont go out of Aeolian mode to save themselves.
3.
The only song in which they do switch to the Phyrigian Mode is "Nomad".
This album seems to have the best song writing since Number of the Beast.

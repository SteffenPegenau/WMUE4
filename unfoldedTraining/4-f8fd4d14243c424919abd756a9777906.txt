I about put my back out!
It is a good vacuum.
I just ordered a 'belt lifter', on ebay, for the next time.
It would get 5 stars if not for the above mentioned issues and the price.
Dyson recommends taking it in for service to remove brush.
LOL But I did get it done.
The hand tools don't 'lock' on.
I give the Animal 4 stars because it does have power and does get the job done.
And one thing I really don't like is that you cannot change the belt.
I have had my Animal for 2 1/2 years.
And if you ever want to take off the brush bar to clean...good luck!
I would like a 'retractable' cord.
I would like a 'light'.
It is attached to the clutch.
I would not buy it again for a few reasons though.

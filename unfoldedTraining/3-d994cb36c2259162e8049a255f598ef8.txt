I have used this model GE Radio for a year now.
The intallation keeps the radio off the counter and that is a plus.
Anyway..mine stopped working.
At least with any kind of normal touch.
There is a grey button you are supposed to quickly touch to turn it on and off.
It must be positioned near an outlet so the wire can be plugged in.
Great if the phone rings or if you pop into the kitchen and want to hear some tunes.
Once it was installed and set up...it worked great.
I have not used the timer feature.
There are other models that come with Cassette and CD capabilities.
Now the good part.
First it is not an easy radio to install.
If you bang the button with a spoon it goes on..eventually.
The radio sounds great and the LED display is big and bright.
Not a great idea for renters.
That is until the on/off switch went bad.
It requires you drill 4 holes in the bottom of a kitchen cabinet and secure the radio to the bottom of that cabinet with 4 bolts.

But it could have been so much better.

Flimsy-feeling player.How to rate such a product, with one GREAT feature, several big weaknesses, and a good price?

You can stick a flash memory device or even a hard drive into it and access all the files on that device -- including playing DivX movies off it.
No S-Video out for those of us who don't yet have a hi-def TV.
Horrible little remote -- few buttons, weak signal, just awful.
But...Cons: 1.
I'll compromise and give it a "3".
It may just be the cheapest way to get a hard drive's worth of DivX movies over to your TV.
This is a HUGE positive and the reason for my purchase.
Rarely has there been a product I so loved and hated at the same time.
Long filenames are NOT supported for that flash/hard drive.
This device has one MAJOR pro and several MAJOR cons.Pro: USB port!

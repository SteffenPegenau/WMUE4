I love that when he was smaller (born at 7lb), we could just use the snaps for his legs and he was very secure and injury-free.
He wouldn't let me sleep, sit or eat.
Baby is very comfy and secure inside.
I thought I'd go crazy.
buy it, is't worth of money.
i never thought that i'd have a colick baby, but I did.
I am a smaller person, but my husband can adjust the carrier to his hight and width just as well.
It's so easy to out him in and go on a walk and just as easy to take him out without waking him up.
Other carriers that we've looked at do not offer anything even close to this.Now,at 2 1/2 month I still love this carrier!
I love that it's adjustable for any hight and length.
WIth baby bjorn he's been snoozing 15 minutes after I put him in.
It was our life saver!
Don't waist your time (and money )on cheap stuff.
Before we bought baby bjorn I had to carry him around ALL THE TIME!
I was in tears myself from exaustion.

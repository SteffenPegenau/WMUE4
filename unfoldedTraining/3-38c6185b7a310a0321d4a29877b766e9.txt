Sense of Danger (5:33)10.
Then we get a mix of Void (not my favorite, which is the junior mix, but this moody mix works here).
Diablo (8:29)7.
And track 7 is no better.
Then suddenly, we get another fierce diva track in Sense of Danger.
Track 3 is an edgy instrumental, the Yello track is snooze city.
Sandstorm always offers something pumpin and interesting, but track 6 is just repetitive noise.
Too much uninspired instrumental stuff.
Over all, this is not a particularly interesting mix.
And again on track 8.
Track times:1. don't you ever give up (5:26)2. void (7:05)3. heaven scent (6:34)4. squeeze please (7:31)5. the return of nothing (10:05)6.
Holdin On (6:16)8.
Magnificat(9:38)9.
And the disc ends of with a light, airy track with a trancey feel.
A sexy dark anthem by Melonie Daniels' begins things off.
Seven Cities (6:55)
DULL.

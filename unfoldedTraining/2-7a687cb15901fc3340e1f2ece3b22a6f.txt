You get no clues on where to go.
And there were too many bosses.
And the Deadite's hardly give you health.
Rent it and beat it that day.
And when I got to disc 2, I said, "That was the shortest ... disc I've ever seen.
Your chainsaw runs out of gas all the time.
I give this game a 2 star.
I bought this game over amazon.com, because ever since I heard about it in July, 2000, I've been waiting forever.
The ending wasn't much of an ending.
The boss's were hard, the deadite's were hard.
I bought it and immediately put it into the Playstation.
I thought it was ok at first, but the Deadites keep coming back.
They should of made it only 1 disc."
I beat the game in about 3 hours total.
Another star for Bruce Campbell's voice.
Don't waist ... your hard earned money.
1 star for giving you something to do for 4 hours.

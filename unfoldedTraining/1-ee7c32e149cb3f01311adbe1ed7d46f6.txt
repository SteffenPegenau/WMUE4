I have to say, this is definitely one of the worst ones.
The characters are shallow and boring.
It had nothing to do with anything in the book and yet the only character whose religion was discussed (besides the main character) was one who was Jewish and who also happened to be the book's only villain.
No one's religion had anything to do with the circus.
I hated it!
I was trying to like it.
I never write reviews but I just can't believe how many readers/reviewers loved this books.
This book came highly recommended.
I have read many, many books.
The only time I was partly enjoying reading this book was during Jacob's elderly years.
As I read the book, I wanted to enjoy it.
I could not.
The writing was aweful, almost childish.
And, unless you are a big circus fan, the most boring book as well!
I could not understand what the author's point was in pointing out (several times) that August was Jewish?
I am so disappointed.

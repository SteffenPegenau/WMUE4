It's just plain, good rap.
But just imagine Jay Z had released a CD called Diamond Is Forever with the following tracklisting:1.
Diamond Is Forever2.
A Dream3.
U Don't Know (Remix)6.
Blueprint10.Excuse me Miss11.Poppin' Tags12.F**k All Nite13.The Bounce14.I Did It My Way15.A Ballad Fo The Fallen SoldierWell, I think it could've been another classic.
Bonnie & Clyde 034.
I guess Jay Z wanted to be up there with Biggie and Pac, creating a double cd classic, but unfortunately it's not a classic...
Everybody knows that Jay Z is one of the most influential and successful rappers of all time.

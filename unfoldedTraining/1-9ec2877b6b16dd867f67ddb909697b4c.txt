The software is very buggy and crashed several times.
I returned it the same day I got it.
The mouse is difficult to use.3.
This is a major inconvenience during a presentation.5.
Limited 16MB internal storage2.
I could only download presentations to the player.
Controlling the presentations from wireless laptops or wired laptops did NOT work.
Here are the problems:1.
You press the next button and it can take 10 seconds for the next slide to appear.
I could not get the feature that allows you to run the presentation from the laptop to work.6.
Stored presentation slides appear only as images.
Remote control is terrible.
The unit takes several seconds to respond to most commands from the remote.
Bullets, animations, transitions and all other effects are lost.4.
Switching between slides is very slow.
The WPG12 looked great by the specs, but I was very disappointed upon using.

It begins as a normal sleepover-loud music, dancing, nail polish etc.
whoever wins gets to eat at the fountain... And that's just the beginning.
Be prepared for laughs and more laughs.Look out for Spongebob.
He is SO mine.
And funny.
til the popular group steps in.Staci and her clic dare Julie and hers to a scavenger hunt.
*sigh* Don't you dare even think about him.
And adorable.
Though, it's the best one I have seen for a long time.
(i'm 12) It has characters that you can relate to.
Julie throws a sleepover with Hannah and Farrah but she decides to invite Yancy at last minute.
Sleepover is the normal tween flick.
Let me tell you about it.It begins with Julie and her friends graduating from jr. high.
He is hot.
Look and adore him, but don't even think about it.
And... You get the point.I luv Russell.

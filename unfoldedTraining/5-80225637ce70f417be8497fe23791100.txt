I didn't have to wash my hair daily, but with fine hair I felt I needed to do it to keep a style.
I am going to try the conditioner next.
I am somewhere in between and am pleased with that.
In the past I always had oily hair.
I have never been able to use conditioner even with the change to dry hair.
Many times you try a new shampoo, and it works for a few days.
I read many reviews for this shampoo and thought people were exaggerating.
Put this on your must try list.
I used the shampoo and was happy with the return of the softness to my hair.
I was in a new world.
The amazing thing was the next morning the softness was still there, and my hair retained the style.
One day I woke up, and my hair was dry.
I am not back to the oil in my hair that I was used to all my life, but my hair does not feel dry any more.
Now I do not feel the need for the daily wash.
This has been weeks and I still like it... a milestone to me.

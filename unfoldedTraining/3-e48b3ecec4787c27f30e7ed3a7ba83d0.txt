I do not hate Barney at all.
Hehehe ^^
Barney is a good boy.
Barney have no tail and no toes now, so i will buy new toy.
Every kid wants a Barney.
They are trading the cards and rip people off with unfair tradings.Barney toy here is not strong fabric and the child chews his tail off.
I tell to them, "no more swetshop working, because the price is go up and the quality is go down."
Don't misunderstand my typing.Barney makes his way into several children's lives.
But the toy is not good.
Also, in just 2 months, I see the Barney has toes sucked on with vigor by the child.........disappear completely!
He still have baby teeth but the tail come off from poor design and bad qualities.
Unbelievable!
Good toy, bad qualitys.
But not Barney toy; I will buy the Pokemon for better craftmen ships, and I will buy pookemon with no tail!
My child love Barney too.
Very much like the Pokemons for every kid is addicted to.

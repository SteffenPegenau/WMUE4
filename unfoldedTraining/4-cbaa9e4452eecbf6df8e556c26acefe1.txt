Will have to go back for a retouch, but thats ok.
This product is definitely a quick fix and since I am a renter, I dont care about the grout, per se, other than the color.
Began applying it with a narrow brush.
Havent gotten that far yet.
Had to remove the sponge applicator as one would have to have a wrestler's grip to squeeze the product.
Wish I'd bought the refill and not this item, thereby avoiding the sponge mess.
The product is good, the company is the best.
This company really knocks itself out for the customer and I very much appreciate that.
I started using it yesterday for the 1st time.
Anything is better than the untreated grout.
Now, getting the excess off may be another story.
Smack in the middle of Storm Sandy, they kept in constant contact and were able to get this order out.
Worked much better.
May have to get a single edged razor blade or a solvant.
Some of my grout was black from mold and some just discolored.

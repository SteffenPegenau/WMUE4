the rest of the tracks here seem a little under cooked.
i love it, but it could have been more.
spaced is cool tune reminiscent of rocks-era aerosmith.
i am a huge fan of izzy.
that was a good album.
bouncy, a little cocky, and fun.
you can actually see somebody getting chased by the cops while the songs is playing.
during guns, post guns.
any izzy is good izzy.
his second disc 117 degrees was an even better album.
some of the tunes are great.
it's not a total loss, you just feel like the ride on this cd went a bit longer.
his first cd was a truly great album that even the rolling stones themselves could only wish they still had in them.
this one Ride On falls short to me.
the title track whips along like rock n' roll should.
however highway zero sounds so intense.

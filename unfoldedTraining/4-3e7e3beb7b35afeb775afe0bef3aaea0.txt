Sounds vaguely like Clutch, as others have said, but nowhere near as good (speaking of singers you want in the equation).
Its lively.
A lot of times I wish some bands didn't have singers (Dream Theater for one.
My 2 cents worth.
Sounds like Kyuss, but not as good.
Just about any death metal band for another).
Funny how some people decide how rock music gets monotonous when the singer is taken out of the equation.
KTB is good background music for whatever you might want to do.
Throw a singer in here and those people wouldn't know what to say.
Sometimes I like my music to have no singer.
Its fun.

Point is .
Its crunchy.

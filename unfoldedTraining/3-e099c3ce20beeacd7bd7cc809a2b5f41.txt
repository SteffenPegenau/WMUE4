Well, I really cannot say that I have finished reading the book.
I'll have to read more to form an exact opinion.
They had vicars back then.
How could there be so many?
I suppose I should not criticize, I mean after all, it is fiction.
Personally, I believe that Wick's best work is in a historical western setting.
This book seems nice, but I can't help but be cynical about the environment.
I will have to do so.
But, I do have to say that I was a bit dissapointed.
Since when does the aristocracy care about God on a personal level?
Plus, a pastor?
If so, their views of christianity are different that what ours are.
I do have to say that I like Wick, but not so much in this series.
What can I expect right?
Those who were religious where strict in their discipline.
I find it a bit historically inacurate.
The gossipers are believeable, but not the christian people.

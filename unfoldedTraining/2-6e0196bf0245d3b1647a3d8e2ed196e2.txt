Just alot of boring dialog between a bunch of ex football players.
It never picked up.
Poor Neely Crenshaw.
What a bore!
There was no plot, no action - really no point.
The most ridiculous part of the story was when an ex-football player turned Prisoner was allowed to attend the funeral.
There really wasn't one likable character in this story.
He never made it as a football star because of an injury in college but The author just seemed to make him a pity party.
The coach was not a likable character - so the reader really didn't care one way or another if he died.
In fact - I was hoping he would hurry up and die so that maybe the story would pick -up.
Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda.
As for the main character, Neely Crenshaw - he was a loser.
Don't waste your time on this one.
The story is about a dying football coach and the deathwatch that ensues.
Even his ex girlfriend (whom we were led to believe by the dj that there would be a reunion or something happily ever after) had no use for him.

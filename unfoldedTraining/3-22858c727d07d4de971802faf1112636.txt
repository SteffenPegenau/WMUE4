I wish I had bought paper pads instead of a big pack of the rolls.
my son is mechanical.
I hoped to be able to get a lot of use out of it because I can leave the chalk out without worry of having walls/furniture ruined as crayons or markers will do.

But it is also really easy to take it apart.
It just doesn't work.Threading the paper through the cutter is pointless.
He is 3.
He takes it apart.
It shouldn't be THAT easy to take apart!Also a complaint, the chalk board.
It was easy enough to put together.
I think if I had to do over again, I would have gotten a different easel.
She draws on it.
I was really happy about this buy for my daughter's birthday.
But no go.
my daughter is artistic.

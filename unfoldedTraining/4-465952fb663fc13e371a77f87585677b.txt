There are some things that have been messed up, badly.
In case you're wondering if this game is on Gamecube, IT'S NOT!
It is so choppy!
Yes, the graphics are great, there are 12 mini-games, etc.
To surprise, this wasn't messed up in the other games, even on GCN!
On to the review!This is basically Monkey Ball 1&2 with 100 new levels.
A GCN disc is 1.5 gigabytes.
1 thing is the menu.
When you move level-to-level, it takes forever.
I would recommend this IF you don't mind choppy menus.
I'm not saying it's the best though.
That's true; that's why I gave it 4 stars.
A PS2 disk is 4 gigabytes.
This is the newest installment of the series.
It needs more than 1.5 gigabytes.

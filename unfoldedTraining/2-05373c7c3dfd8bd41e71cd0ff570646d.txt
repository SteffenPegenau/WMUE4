Cast miter scale gets covered w/ sawdust as does magnified pointer (Keep an air nozzle handy!)
Dust gets into bevel lock down causing saw head to slide down to 45' bevel, even during a cut.
I find myself going back to my nine-year-old Makita LS 1211.
Customizable miter stop feature allows for one stop only...not very helpful when doing crown, base or other cuts where you need a corresponding angle.
I would not buy this saw again.
I ended up using a "Sharpie" to make some of the angles more visible.
Miter lock handle quickly became loose and fell off.
Trigger safety button would be nice.
Quality laser would be nice.
I've owned this saw for about a year and still can't get used to it.
Smooth running machine w/ tight fit and feel.
Fence extensions do not slide far enough out of the way and must be disassembled to reach certain compound angles.
Dust collection needs improving.
Quality components.
No option given for dust bag.

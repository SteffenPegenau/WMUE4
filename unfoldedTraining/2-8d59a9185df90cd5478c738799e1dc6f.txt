Zero character development.
When I first saw the first film I was indeed shocked.
On a shock scale this rates way beneath Cannibal Holocaust.
An artistic statement?
I like my blood red!
People calling it the most grotesque film ever made haven't seen enough gross out films.
Loved it!
Sure it has moments and it is twisted but much more boring than the original.
Why???
And the whole black and white thing?
See it because you have to, but don't believe the hype!
I am sure that was the direction Tom Six wanted to go but it didn't work for me.
Very disturbing and sickening images.
Great acting and seriously twisted villain.
Now seeing the second I am very disappointed.

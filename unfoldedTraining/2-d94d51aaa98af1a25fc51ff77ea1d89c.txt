The incidents we got in this book are not it.
Uninspired.
A formulaic series like this needs something in each book to set it apart.
Yes, he probably is plotting behind your back.
It could so easily have been different, but even the moving, powerful moments, were done in a flash with no real emotion.
It was all too simple.I am a bit sick of Harry being right about everything.
He always has sneaking suspicions.
Dull.
They are always right.
Harry could be wrong sometimes, just to keep things interesting.
Given how formulaic the other books in this series are, it was disappointing to see the formula being repeated without anything to give it a bit of spark.
Boring.
Yes, Malfoy is nasty.
So what?
Only a few words.

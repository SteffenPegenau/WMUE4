I also tried my bikini line not as painful as imagine since last time I did with traditional waxing and I cried.
The only negative I have is that it wasn't enough.
With shaving and depilators the hair would grown back darker and faster.
So, I learned how to make it thanks to youtube and haven't bought a new pack since.
I've tried at home hard waxing kits, it painful, messy and not worth trying again.
I have tried shaving, depilators, epilators and waxing.
I read a lot of reviews on Moom before trying it.
I've tried waxing a salon painful and can get expensive.
Using an epilator took too much time.
I would absolutely recommend this, if you're new to waxing it might hurt but it will hurt a hell of a lot less than with any other.
It was painful for my underarm since the hair was much thicker.
It wasn't painful on my legs at all.
Waxing strip don'r work at all.
Th hair does grow back in light.
The hair does take longer to grow but I would not say up to 8 weeks.

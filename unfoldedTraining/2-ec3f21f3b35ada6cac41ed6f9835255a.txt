Again they are great... when they work.
I ask how.
I have it linked to a couple different devices and it is the same with each one of them.
Can never get an answer out of them.
Of coarse someone new responds ea time and never reads the previous info.
I am stuck with them... working or not.
Motorola is no help.
I have only had them since Easter of 08.
Excuse me but it is the headset that is not working.
One tells me to resink it.
You would think that with all the complaints on volume control they would post some trouble shooting advice.
Sincerely, Sherri
I would give these a 10 when they work however the majority of the time the volume gets stuck on low.
Then out of the blue the volume goes up and down on their own.
Another responds contact Apple because I am linked to my Ipod.
These were a gift and the giver got rid of the receipt.

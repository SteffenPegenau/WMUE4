The color "tan" was different than the photo shown on Amazon.
My sister and mom both had this high chair and so I decided to buy one myself.
Because of the plasticy material my daughter tends to sweat in it.
Seems durable & sturdy.
It does not slide underneath our table and so it does just kind of sit to the side of the table.
I like this material as it is easy to wipe down.
All in all, good high chair.
Other than that it is a functional high chair.
I had read this before buying it and so I knew what I was getting into.
I probably don't like the color/design as much, but it doesn't really bother me.
Holds child secure.
I thought the height adjusters might do it, but they just don't.
Have not tried booster seat.
It is a great high chair.
The lowest setting won't slide under the table.

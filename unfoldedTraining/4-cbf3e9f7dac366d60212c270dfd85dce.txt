That being said, if you enjoyed GTA3 there isn't too much new here.
It's flat and boring, much like Florida.
Liberty City was far superior.
All in all, I recommend buying this game.
Yes this is a great game.
Oh, and if you haven't played Max Payne, what the h are you waiting for?
filtering at 1280x1224.
On my XP 2.0 Ghz P4, 1Ghz RDRAM, and brand new ATI 9800 Pro 128MB video card the graphics are pretty stellar.
Looks great.
There are some cool new things but all in all its all familiar.
Personally I totally dislike the Miami-ish setting.
and 16x antro.
If you have a fast computer and a killer 3d card you will love the graphics.
Can't wait for Doom 3 which will really put my system to the test.
The game itself has no real customizing options for graphics, but my card does, so I'm running 6x anti ali.

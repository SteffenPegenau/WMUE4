Batman, Hourman, Dr.
Midnight, and Mr.
One of the best Elseworld tales I've read, that doesn't flat-out ape the comic formula of the characters it is representing.
Worth the money.
If you like the characters of the JSA- those original Golden Agers, then you are in for a trip- and a much more realistic look at the way they WOULD have acted in that time and place.LOTS of twists and turns, but an unexpected level of violence, and killing, especially coming from many of these Heroes.
Terrific, are a bunch of Nazi busters.
What a cool concept making many of DC's heroes into spies for the government during WWII and the Cold War.
Heroes...
I'd have more of a problem with this... but they ARE soldiers here.
Icons.
Definately check it out, if you have the opportunity.
Powerhouses.
Spies?
So, it's all cool.
Several other classic characters pop up, especially when Superman joins the team.

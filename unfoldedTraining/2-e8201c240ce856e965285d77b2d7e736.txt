!The ONE (huge) drawback to this?
Kiss, Godsmack, Sambora, Uncle Ted, you name it, these guys ALL kick ass, and the fact that they did this show says a LOT about their dedication to this country.
Censoring performances like this is just tacky!!!Petty?
You just do NOT censor rock concerts, period!!!
Sure, you get the idea, but what, are we 12 now?
?Do NOT buy this if you're after the REAL experience.
Maybe, but let's get real here, I have been to countless shows over the past 10 years, and its just WRONG to censor this stuff.
!
Yeah, maybe taking the nudity out of 'em (flashing) is needed, but seriously, WTF??
The best of the best performances, and collaborations here.
Talk about a HUGE disappointment !!
Censorship.
You'd think I would have bought this thing at Wal-Mart.
This takes a HUGE part of the experience from it!!!
Just awesome!!
I love almost every band on this DVD.

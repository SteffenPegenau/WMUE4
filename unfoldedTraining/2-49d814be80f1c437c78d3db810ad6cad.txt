This model cannot handle deep pile carpet.
These are expensive items, and I cannot afford to replace them every year.
I have owned 2 of these carpet cleaners.
After a few months same problem.
I do like the heat aspect, and when these carpet cleaners work, they are wonderful.
Belts broke, plastic knobs broke, plastic hose holder broke, The groved pulley on the brush broke.
I will buy a more expensive model Bissel proheat next time.
But too many cheap parts, too much plastic for me.
You will burn up the belts for sure.
Also, I have one room with deep pile carpet, really thick, probably 2 inches long.
It kept breaking so I bought a new, same model, Bissel cleaner.
The first one I loved until it broke.
I tried fixing it many times, ordered spare parts from the internet.
Even ordering spare parts, and using parts from the 1st Bissel did not keep this second cleaner running for more than a year.
Do not use this model on deep, long, heavy pile carpet.

when you get sick of holding the gun you can lay down and deploy it.
Its a lot better in a open area where you have good line of sight.
Also it is super heavily!
but fortuntly it comes with one!
and the clips on the strap will come off easily and that is always a pain.
First of all i love the gun!
allowing you to make good accurate shots.
The bi pod is nice!
when i get done playing for 3 hours my arms are so sore!
shots great and accurately!
it is a pain to reload the 25bb clips by hand!
I gave it a four star because of the weight
the gun does not work very well in a close envorments!
you must have a speed reloader.
although i was expecting a little more range for the price of the gun.
all in all i love the gun and it will still shot over a hundred feet!

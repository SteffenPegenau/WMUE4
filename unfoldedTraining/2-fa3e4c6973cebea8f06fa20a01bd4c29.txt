Whiney, wimpy, nerdy, pop songs.
Like the one guy wrote, it's Bryan Adams limey style.
Mozart?
Big deal.
Johnny Cash?
They don't have to rock out, but this record just has no balls.
Van Morrison?
Now we have Adam Sandler and Paddy Mcaloon.
Joni Mitchell?
Nina Simone?
Geez!
Matchbox 21 or whatever their name is sounds like this, and they suck!
A few good songs, but no big deal.
Richard Thompson?
We hear this every day.
This word "genius" sure comes easy these days.
It used to take Joyce, Melville, Nobel, C.V. Raman.
Have you people never listened to Miles Davis and Gil Evans?

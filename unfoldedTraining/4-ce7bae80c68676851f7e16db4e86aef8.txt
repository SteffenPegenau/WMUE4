Then comes along a boy named Dexter who changes that.
It's easy to pay attention to, easy to understand.
Remy goes through a lot of life experience.
He wrote a song for her when she was borned called This Lullaby.
They're close to being opposites, but they become close.
It can teach you a lot.
In the end, he leaves.I liked this book.
I would recommend this book.
Remy is sure she'll never be with any musician.
Overall, I would give this book a great review.
It all started out with her mom & dad's relationship.
Dexter's in a band who travels to different places, trying to become known.
Her dad is a musician.
She's a great writer.
She doesn't really believe in anything serious.
She's a character who's really easy to relate to because she's very down to earth.
It's one of my favorites.
I read it because I enjoyed Sarah Dessen's other book I had read a lot.
This Lullaby is about a girl named Remy who thinks she has everything about love figured out.

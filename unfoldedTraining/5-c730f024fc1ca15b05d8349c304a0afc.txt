A toast!
A round table to make King Arthur proud.
Tenure all around.
So many insights.
All of you--really.
Stupendous!
Bravo, marvellous.
Ideal.
Really, truly marvelous.
Not a word out of place.
A real Salon--Kantian style.
I can't rave enough.
You've got Paris on the Iowa River out there, you really do.
Perfection!
Brilliant, on every possible level.
So true, everything was so true; and so well-said, from start to finish.
Tenure for everyone!
On me!

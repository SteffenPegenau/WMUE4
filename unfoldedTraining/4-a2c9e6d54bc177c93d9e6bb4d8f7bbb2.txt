*Strong smell.
It lasts for 7 minutes tops and if it burns, it means it is working.
Here is some things to consider, though:' Pros '*It zaps pimples quickly*It's made with organic materials*Works on mild acne, skin irritaions and bug bites too.
:)
Not exactly a con but it's liquid so don't get it in your eyes, it stings ;)So buy it?
I've been using this product for around one year now and have little to complain.
*If you put it on your forehead it WILL RUN INTO YOUR EYES!
Cons '*It does burn a lot.
*It's really convenient.
I LOVE the roll-on part, it's so simple to apply!'
I keep it in my purse and use it 4-7 times daily in between classes and during the day.
Pass?
Up to you but I love it.
I am 16 years old and it seriously isn't that bad.
It smells like strong spices> I like it.
:) I find it refreshing.
My friends think it smells really weird but it isn't.

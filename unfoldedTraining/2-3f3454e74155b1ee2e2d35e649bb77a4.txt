Suspense and Action books are "in" and there's enough good writers out there to spend you money on.
Don't spend your money on this one.
Maybe the main character is a joker.
It's filled with SO MANY mind numbing facts (2 pages of horse trailer models, 3 pages of boring details about a horse spread and a page of irrelevant facts concerning computer "cookies").
It's a page turner.
I can't say that about every book.
Yes.
Maybe he's akin to Tokien's Aragorn.
No.
Did I finish the book?
Neither me nor my girlfriend ever visualized the book's characters.
But... would I recommend it?
Is David Baldacci a good writer?
Who knows?
It's a badly written page turner.
I did finish the book.
The plot provides enough for the reader to keep turning the pages.
No.
But...

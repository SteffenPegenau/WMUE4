It makes P90x something you do not look forward to doingI hope BeachBody makes a better workout than this alternative.
NOT THE SAME TONY!!
First of all P90x changed my life.
Every 5 minutes you will hear a Plug: BUY BOWFLEX SELECT TECH WEIGHTS!!!
Here are my reasons:1.
FAST NO FORM!!
Tony even scolds him sometimes.3.
He goes extremely fast and loses form and balance many times.
P90X music is TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE.
TERRIBLE MUSIC!!
My wife does ChaLean, she gets results and the music is great and really pumps you up.
Don't watch him if you purchase this.
I have never reviewed a product, but would like to express that I'm disappointed in P90x Plux.
PROMO BOWFLEX!!
THEY ARE GREAT!!4.
There is a guy in the workout named Mark Briggs.
His tone, jokes, and enthusiasm lacks.
If you buy this , YOU WILL REGRET IT.
Buy it and you'll see.2.

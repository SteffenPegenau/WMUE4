I did like chapter 15 on navigation aids.
(BTW: My 12-yr old daughter put this down even faster than I did!
This was not it.

It describes all HTML commands using a variant of BNF.
There is a CD that comes with the book that supposedly contains worked examples.
)The first 4-5 chapters were boring essays on the history of the web and html.

She wanted to know how to create webpages.

I was expecting a "how-to" book with lots of worked examples.

WOW!
I seen this sub listed @ Amazon, I researched and looked for other reviews outside of amazon and ran across that Best Buy sells the exact same one.
Once it came in and I connected to my Harman Cardon 635 AVR 7.1 receiver, WOW!
It gives you the right amount of low end from movies and as well the rumbles, and heavy breathing in movies!
I cant believe I paid this less of money for a brand new sub woofer!
than Best Buy.
You can't beat the amount of quality for the dollar!
I decided to purchase through amazon because the price is ALOT LOWER!
This thing sounds great!!!!
I'm just taking AWAY!!!!!!!
So I traveled to the nearest Best Buy and tested it out and it was out of thid world!
When I purchased this amazing sub, I knew it would work out great for me and my economical built media/theater room.
WOW!
!
Also I have them working along Audio Acoustics 6 inch movie theater speakers and center channel, which also sounds GREAT!!!!

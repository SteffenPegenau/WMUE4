Device did not support the mouse scroll wheel on any of 4 mice on hand.
It did not work either.
What a joke.
They stated that since the new unit works the same the device is performing properly.
They replaced it with a new unit at no cost (very good service).
I would have to try another mouse (not so good support).
It is not their product, but the unit does not work within reasonable expectations.
Its hard to blame the seller.
The D-Link unit demonstrated that the Startech unit really is a piece of junk.
I contacted the manufacturer who stated that it does support the mouse wheel function.
I got to pay shipping both ways (and maybe restocking fees too) to find that out.
A two button Microsoft IntelliMouse is a basic mouse at this point.
They claim it only supports basic mouse functions.
Lucky me.
I returned it and purchased a D-Link KVM-121, which works great and includes switched audio.

It has a phillips head and standard screw driver.
If you are choosing this one because you are low on funds, wait and save up for one of the better models.
I thought it would be more like my old leatherman.
The knife blade is small.
The blades open to inside of the handle.
It has a blade.
Still, for the price, it's not bad.
It is fine for my use, occasional fix it and light work.
Cons: The blades don't lock.
It's not.
I didn't want a lot of extraneous tools (I have never used a saw blade on a pocket knife.)
Pros: It is cheap.
Pliers seem solid and sturdy.
I am a skeptical as to whether it would hold up to heavy everyday use from a construction worker or the like.
Bought this item from Target locally for 21.99.

BUT CORRECT ME IF IM WRONG.
I THOUGHT WHEN THE MOVIE STARTED THEY WERE CHURCH GOING TEENS, TRYING TO STAY CELEBATE.
IT STARTED TO GET INTERESTING.
I THOUGHT THAT HOLE CONCEPT WAS SO STUPID.
THIS MOVIE HAD IT'S MOMENTS BUT NOT TO MANY.
IM GLAD I BOUGHT IT!
AFTER THE FIRST 40 MINUTES IT PICKED UP.
ANYWAY I GUESS IT JUST THE CONCEPT OR SOMETHING.
WHAT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WOULD DO SOMETHING THAT RIDICULAS?
THE IDEA OF THE TEETH WERE COOL.
NEXT TIME I WATCH IT WILL PROBABLY BE WITH SOMEONE WHO NEVER SEEN IT!
I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY WHEN SHE WENT TO THE DOCTORS OFFICE FOR A CHECK UP.
BUT IT WAS A HIGH SCHOOL.
LOVE THAT SONG IN THE END... YOU DID BY CHUCK PROPHET
THE FIRST 40 MINUTES OF THIS MOVIE SUCKED.
I THOUGHT I GOT BURNED AGAIN.
IF A WOMAN HAS A MAN DOCTOR AND HE'S LIKE EXAMING HER, SHOULD THERE NOT BE A FEMALE NURSE IN THERE TOO?

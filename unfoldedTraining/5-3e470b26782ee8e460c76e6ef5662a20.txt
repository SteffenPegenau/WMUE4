This is an extraordinary recording.
And at the same time, there are songs like, "Them" ,that made me laugh out loud.
The songs are great.
(Adryan Russ actually sings a song herself.
The arrangments are BEAUTIFUL.
Every song is top-notch.
So, buy this CD while you can still get a copy!!!!
It's rare that ANY recording can hold my attention like that.
The world is definitely going to hear more of Adryan Russ.
Her voice is GORGEOUS!)
The artists are great.
I was literally glued to my seat listening to every note and lyric until I had listened to the CD in it's entirety.
Susan Egan's poignant rendition of, "I Hate to See You Go" brought tears to me eyes.
This is a great CD.

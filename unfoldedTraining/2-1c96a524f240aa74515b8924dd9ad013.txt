No.
What's it good for then?
What are you going to do now?
No.
Using the smallest blade the spirals came out in quarter inch chunks.5.
I bought this because it looks like it should be easier to use and more sturdy than the Saladacco.1.
Easy to use?
Twice the size of the Saladacco.4.
Can you get ribbon thin spaghetti-like spirals?
Yes.
I could spiralize carrots in the Saladacco but not in this thing.3.
Send it back and resign myself to using the Saladacco, which is not a perfect solution, but until someone somewhere designs something better it seems to be the only option.
Sturdy?
No, I couldn't.
It seems to do a good job of purposefully wasting a large portion of the fruit or vegetable you're trying to slice by pushing it through a hole that cuts a half inch core out of the fruit or vegetable.6.
The plastic is flimsy, and the crank (all plastic) is less solid than the Saladacco crank which at least has a metal arm.2.
Overly large and bulky?

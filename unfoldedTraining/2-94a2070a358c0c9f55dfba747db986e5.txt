I would play this for informational purposes only, but don't expect to be impressed.
The storyline is very shaky, with a flat-out horrible ending.
If you buy it, I suggest you buy Substance instead, since it comes with this game AND more games.
Stick to MGS4 for a true sequel (Heres hoping its not as lame as MGS2)
The first game in the MGS series rocked.
Raidan is a Phem-bot, with pretty much no emotions, a overly high pitched voice, and a feminine build.
Its fun.
LAME!
Next thing you know...you are playing a different character, named raidan.
And liquid, is pretty much just an arm possessing ocelot.
I expected the sequel to be my new favorite...I was wrong.
A little long, but fun.
The ship you are on explodes.
It is my favorite Psx game.
The first 1/4 of the game you are Snake, using the traditional Stealth method to take reconnasince photos.
It turns out the whole thing was just a simulation.
Its a huge waste of time, and does not contribute to the MGS series.
Okay.

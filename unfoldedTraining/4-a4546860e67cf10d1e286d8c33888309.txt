And most of all what is Oh So Special about Keleios that the Darkhealer elf prince would rather kill or be killed by her if he could not wed her?
Where is her father?
Why were her parent never married?
It should have been the 2nd or 3rd book at the very least.
Nightseer is like a the star wars movies it begins in the middle.
It aggravates a person if they there is know pervious book to explan the one they are reading.
BUT!!
Keleios was a trip.
How did the Witch escape death?

Where is her father's people?
Don't git me rong I truely enjoyed the book.
This should not be the first book in the series!
Why is Keleios rejected by her mother's people?
I love the character they just came to life for me.
How did she get the Demondmark and why such a powerful one?
That is if there is to be a series.

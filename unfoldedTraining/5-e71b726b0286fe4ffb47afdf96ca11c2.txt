As a new transplant to the Windy City, this book has been a great help.
Weller's recommendations for restaurants are superb.
He's really funny and knows Chicago like nobody's business.I highly recommend this book.
I'd love to meet this writer!
I bought this guidebook on a whim and was not disappointed!
Most guides are written by some unknowm.

It's also really funny!
not this one!
I have visited several spots named in the book and they were all great.
it's informative while highly entertaining.
"Secret Chicago" goes where few travel guides go.
And since moving here (from Kansas City), I have seen Weller's name in the Chicago Tribune and New City often.

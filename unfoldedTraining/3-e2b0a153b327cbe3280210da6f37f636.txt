Okay, I had the orginal LP, Goonhiily Down, back in 1980.
"Break It To Me Gently" has a nice melody.
I had read a pretty good review in Rolling Stone or Penthouse, someplace.
It has moments of interest.
It's pretty retro sounding.
Other people are there, too.
I'm not quite saying it sucks, but it certainly has that 79/80 feel to it.
I'm sure most don't have this in their collection.
"I'm On Fire" is not bad.
So I ordered it.
The sound is light and quirky, similar to Thomas Dolby or Men At Work.
Maybe my taste have changed in 30 years.
I'm much less familiar with the songs from Spot.
He plays keysboard, bass, guitar, drums, & sings, plus he wrote all the songs.
But it's kinda like the Steve Lindsay Show.
Steve Lindsay is behind it all.

50-cent sucks.
50-cent is hated so much that hes been shot 9 times.3.
People just sing blurred words, that would rhyme if you could hear them.
all rap is the same.
Classical music is better than this junk.
if you want good music buy a Green Day or U2 CD.
50-cent is isn't talented, he doesn't play an instrument.2.
It's just my opinion but, I'M RIGHT!
He raps so bad he needs to play his backround music louder than his voice so that nobody can hear his voice.I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND BUYING THIS CD.
He just plain sucks.
Nothing special.
50-CENT SUCKS.3 reasons why you should not buy this CD:1.
50-cent is a gay over shot loser who has other people create songs for him to sing and get rich off of, while the designer of the song get 5%.
rap is bad no matter who's singing.

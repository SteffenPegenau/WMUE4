Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in his first barbaric role and proves that if you want to rule, you must have a big sword.
I was deeply touched by this legend and wished upon a star for the gods to make more of these movies.
His kingdom is full of nudity and snakes.
Revenge has never been prettier.
Talk about violence!
Sharp!
When Arnold perpetrates the king's lair, it's historical.
With the help of a wizard and Valeria, the woman he loves, Conan rules the kingdom.
He goes through a lot of weird situations involving a witch, who he throws in a fire and devouring combatants in dungeon fighting!
Conan puts the sword to good use and when he gets his hands on the creature which killed his parents, it's astonishing!
A young boy who witnesses his parents' deaths is taken prisoner and grows up as a slave for the snaky Thulsa Doom.
He must have thrown that head twenty feet!
This movie is remarkable.
The boy grows up to be a fighter, thief and warrior.
Grotesque!

The MoS "Chillout Session" series is better than this.
The discs are gimicky.
(Read other reviewer's comments about including your voicemail messages...)3.
Ultra, Radikal, and UBL have better stuff than this.
I like Paul Okenfold and Perfecto, but this is a letdown...
If I get two CDs, I expect at least 60 min/disc, and probably 70+.5.
Not everything is mixed, let alone mixed well.
The Euphoria chillouts are better than this.
All I can say is this didn't really tickle my fancy.
I like my chill to be continuous.
I've got over 50 discs of it.
There is better stuff out there.
Not to nitpick, but if you have two 50-minute CDs with a bit of crud on them, you could really make it a single 80-minute disc.
I didn't like the music (but you might, of course).2.
Heck, even Deca and Beechwood have better stuff than this.Can you tell I'm disappointed?
I like chillout music.
Here's why:1.
The discs aren't full.
Disc 2 here isn't mixed at all.4.

Not much thought went into providing solutions.
Much more than I am willing to write here.
Anyone can criticize, but the good ones come up with solutions.
A very biased book (at least he admits it).
His statistics don't paint the full picture.
It's not Mexicans, it's illegals!
The statistics he uses--conveniently picks and chooses to support his argument.
He doesn't distinguish between legal and illegal immigration.
The depiction of life as an illegal immigrant and how immigrants help the American economy.
What is good about it?
He states there is no way to fix it and suggests that since it can't be fixed, to open our borders fully.
All he does seem to do is whine about what is not right.
He seems to find no problem with illegal immigration--that's what really bothers people.
He believes that it's Mexicans that Americans dislike.
What is flawed?
There is no advocation about increasing the number of work permits or any cracking down on people who hire the illegals.

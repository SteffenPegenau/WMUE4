I started with #3 and read to #6 then went back and read 1 and 2.
This may be why I don't like this book.
So just make sure you read it to begin with and it's all good.
For all those who are going "Three stars?
I'm a die-hard fan and love all the books.
But if my three favorite in the series rate 5 then the two I like the least can't rate the same right?
Now for all of you who are shopping for Anita books.
They're good books don't get me wrong!
Tsh I barely made it through.
My suggest is READ THE FIRST ONE FIRST.
yes I know slightly harsh.
My mind get wandering and I was going Jean-Claude and Richard crazy.
Only three stars!"
So...while I liked it this book doesn't have the riveting quality of the later books.
But the first two books in the series don't live up to my expectations.

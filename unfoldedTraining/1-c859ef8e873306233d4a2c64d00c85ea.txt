They have a Colt on the webley page.
First off, I decided to just thumb through it and check out some of the photos.
And the so called "current collectors values" is a JOKE.
Wow, was i wrong!
I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND.
I collect World War 2 weapons and this book is the biggest dissappointment of all the books that I have on the subject.
Find something else rather than waste your money on this.
If the guns were actually worth as much as the author has them listed, I'd have a majority of them.
But i don't cause almost ALL OF THEM ARE UNDER PRICED.
They have a PPsH ejector port on the Thompson page.
Kinda irk'ed me but i decided to start reading it.
He also has a 1918 Browning Automatic Rifle listed under rifles, but in all actuallity, it's a machine gun.
Several mistakes on the weapons.
Ok, i purchased this book because from what it looked liked, it was gonna be good.
Well, there are mislabled photos through out the book.

Really wrong.
I am sending all of them back.
Took it down.
Repeatedly.
These were an updated version and rated to be good with few false alarms.
I took it down.
Wrong.
I am never going to buy another Kidde product.
Now the upstairs one started the same thing.
I don't care if I get any refund.
The basement one has never alarmed.
On battery only, it seems to never alarm.
Put it back up.
I took the battery out.
Within a few days of putting them up one started alarming.
This is my second set of Kidde smoke detectors.
Good for a few day, and it started alarming.

"You are" off Riot Act.
No politics, just a solid album that sounded fresh at the time (and still does).
Just some theories.....
It SEEMS more energetic and the lyrics are good poetry (gotta read the lyric book, you will not make them out binaurally.)
PJ have had their time.
PJ didn't have as many problems in their past as RHCP, hence they are less interesting, i guess.
But that was long ago now, I guess.
Ed's quite a poet; can do without the politics.
You know what was Avante-Garde?
Techrock?)
Make a whole album like that; make the next grunge, whatever it would be called (Trance rock?
To compare current work, PJ is not quite as good as RHCP (another older band that is still functioning.)
But, I suppose it would have to come from a band with members still in their 20s.
It's token PJ energy; it doesn't feel real.
You want to talk about a reviving album.... Pearl Jam's Yield.

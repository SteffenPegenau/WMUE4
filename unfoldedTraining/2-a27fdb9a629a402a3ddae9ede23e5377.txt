it's a digi-pak?
first off... what's so special about this limited edition?
so what.
i highly recommend you preview this on a listening station at the store before spending your money.
a couple of songs are really good, but the rest just put me to sleep.
they are a pain to store, and just not an improvement at all.
wow!
and for someone so vain, he couldve at least through something enhanced, like some pictures or something.
he whines through most of the songs, and he seems to think he's michael jackson's re-incarnate.
big mistake.
make sure you like the style of the whole album, because the rest of the album is not even remotely near as good as the first single Like I Love You.
i'm an nsync fan, so i figured i'd go ahead an get this one.
and the music.
i was seriously disappointed when i picked this one up.
surely not worth my money.

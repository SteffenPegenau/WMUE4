However the wash cloths are another story.
To put the icing on the cake, they are getting frayed at the edges.
They are not quite as thick and the towels and they look cheap.
They are thick, plush and oversized.
Basically, you can count on a quality towel and a substandard washcloth that you will have to be very careful with.
They hold stains.
Just the kind of towels that I like.
I have had these sets for a year and a half and I really loved the way that these towels felt when I got them.
They are of a lesser quality.
My husband plays football and he sometimes gets filthy.
I could ignore this if it was anything other than dirt that stained them.
I can handle that, but they also have one major problem.
I have tried all kind of treatments with these washcloths and they still will not look totally clean and that is just gross.
All of this while the towels still look practically new.
These are the only washcloths that I own that have done that.

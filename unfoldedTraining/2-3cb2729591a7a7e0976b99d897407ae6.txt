Just received this saw today.
stars.Update 2-9-2010: Change from 4 stars to 2 stars.1.
This little saw is heavy and well made.
No case2.
Cut with ease.
No tilt adjustments.4.
I give it 4 stars because there is no case.
However, this is still a well made saw and very powerful.
All of my existing blades are 5/8" arbor.3.
Ryobi makes a better one for a much lower price.Probably not the best saw for the price.
7/8 arbor.
Hitachi makes excellent tools overall and I will continue to buy Hitachi.
Otherwise it would be five.
Used it to cut out some 1/4 inch grout lines.
It is easy to use and powerful.

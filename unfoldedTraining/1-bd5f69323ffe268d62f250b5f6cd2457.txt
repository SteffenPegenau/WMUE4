Kids bop has finally destroyed everything good in the world!!!
And now look at it!
And whatever parent buys this for their children is apparently tone deaf as well!
What were they thinking whenever they decided to destroy stuff done by the Beatles?
Sure, toddlers may like it, but that's because they're tone deaf!!!
Don't raise a tone deaf nation!
Don't buy 'kidz' bop!!!!
It's crazy!
I never believed that it would happen...but it finally has!
How can any sane parent buy this for their children!?!
Just, dead, rolling on the floor, dead.
The original artists are sooooooooooo ashamed...and for all you crackheads who say that, kidz bop is for 'kidz', I AM a kid!!!
And "Happy Together" that was one of my favorite songs!
If you want good music go out and buy the originals!!!
And I absolutely HATE this CD!!!!!!!!
Let me repeat, KID.

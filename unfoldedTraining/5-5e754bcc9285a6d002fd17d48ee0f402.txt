This is the 4th drill of Milwaukee I still own.
My Milwaukee's have lasted at least over 2yrs.
Screws have just twisted off.
I wish I had bits and screws as strong as this tool.
I Have put this tool to its test.
It might get hot but it keeps on going and going.
I do tile work also,, Lock and Load a 2 foot paddle and mix up some thin set in a 5 gal bucket.
I laugh at you all that don't give this tool it's respect.
I do have a dewalt drill at the house my wife can use.
Lots of laughs.
My electric dewalt gave out on me.
I have!
I have worked in the construction area for 20 plus yrs.
I have owned Makita,skill, ryobi,craftman,dewalt,black&decker cordless tools.
BUT A real tool needs to be by my side, at the job.
Keep up the good work Milwaukee.. For those battery critics, I have burned up many of the competions faster than milwaukee's.
Bits just shatter or strip off.
This drill is so strong.
THE BIG RED ONE
I also have 2 combo kits I have purchased.

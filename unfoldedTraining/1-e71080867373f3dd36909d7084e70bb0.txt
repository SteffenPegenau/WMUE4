!Why did they make this movie?
Wouldn't they rather have read a book, or gone jogging?-->The negative aspects:1.
The sound recording makes you wonder why silent films are catching on again!3.
The sets are very convincing...convincingly lousy!7.
(no offense meant for Walt Disney).Please note: This list could continue endlessly!-->The positive aspects:1.
Horribly horrible!
Horrible!
Peter Ustinov (!)6.
The music (meant to be eerie and have a mysterious air) really makes one scream...for other reasons, though!5.

A cabbage placed in place of each actor, would have acted more impressively!2.

Completely and utterly horrible!

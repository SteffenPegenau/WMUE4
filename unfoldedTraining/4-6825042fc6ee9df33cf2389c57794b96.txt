Its not everyday you find music like that.So what if you don't like their lyrics etc.
Go complain to them.
But if anyone would actually listen to what they are saying they would realize that the band.. doesn't really care what anyone thinks.
etc.
(: Not.They're saying wake up to the reality of how this world is.
Its like a new style for them, and personally, I admire how they took on this edge.
Yep its vulgar.
that is WHY this cd is so vulgar.
They are coming back, rebeling against mainstream.. and personally I find that admirable.
Yep its obsene.
If they cared about what other people thought than I guess they would still be making their watered down stuff eh?
Its pretty degrading to women but besides that.. the songs grow on you.
I'm sure they'll care.
Well, I must say I despised this album when I first heard it.
You want sheltered music.. look else where.

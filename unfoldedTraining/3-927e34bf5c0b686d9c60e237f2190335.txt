Only this way you'll manage the absence of some unforgettable numbers...
The cd is ok, but there's a tremendous lack of life.
Sing!
Sing!.
I can't stand this.
It was supposed to be the best cd I'd ever bought, but it's a little disappointing.
All That Jazz?
Can you think about FOSSE and simply forget Mein Herr?
In my opinion people who like Bob Fosse feel fascinated with the energy of Fosse's numbers.
But I can't stop wondering...Dear God!!!
His greatest point is the vibration, the sensuality and how we get involved by that "celebration in song and dance".
Fosse has such wonderful moments that could have been figuring in this album...Thanx it counts on Big Spender, Rich Man's Frug and Sing!
Where's Cabaret?
Where's Mein Herr?!?!?!
Oh God!
Ok, it's a good cd, but you gotta really love Fosse.

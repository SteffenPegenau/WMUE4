If you are a fan, buy it.
I would like to have a story written about Garret and Catherine...without the sad ending.
Next, I read A Bend in the Road.
I read A Walk to Remember and could not put it down.
Then you think Theresa is a jerk and then you think Garrett cannot make a committment.
This was very good with a satisfying ending.
Yes, you will cry but it is worth it.
It is a beautiful book.
Then when you aren't looking, the gut-wrenching ending hits you in the face like a bucket of cold water.
Wow!
First, you hope they break up.
I recommend the two above mentioned books.
I didn't need to mourn and cry over the loss one of the characters.
The book goes on and on!
I made the mistake of reading it prior to Christas and it was really sad.
If not, read A Bend in the Road.
My last book by Nicholas Sparks was Message in a Bottle.
It was almost like the entire relationship wasn't worth the trouble since it was never going to work out.

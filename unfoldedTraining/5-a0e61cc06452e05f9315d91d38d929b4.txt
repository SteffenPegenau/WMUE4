and the latest video "You Rock My World?....Maybe theres a part 2 of this collection waiting somewhere to be released.
Childhood?
Also a duet with his legendary sister Janet.
Everything he releases, I purchase!
Will You Be There?
Give In To Me?
Where is SCREAM?
Michael Jackson is the greatest and will always be.
Also where is Who Is It?
One of the best videos ever recorded and most expensive video ever.
Man In The Mirror?Another Part Of Me?
Also where is the rarley seen "She's Out Of My Life" video?..That was a hit single back in 1980.
Gone Too Soon?
I am a huge Michael Jackson fan!
The only flaw I have with this item is that its missing a few classic videos.
He is one of the few living legends left out there.
I remember getting this at the time when it came out and I was very pleased at the hole package.

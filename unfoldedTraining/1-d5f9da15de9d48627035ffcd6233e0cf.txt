I love kd but this is a terrible disappointment.
What about Robbie Robertson?
What about Burton Cummings?
As for the kd lp well: Neil Young has recorded thousands of songs.
What about Paul Anka?
What about The Band?
And there are hundreds of other Canadian songs I would like to hear.
This sucks.
to add to my review of the kd lang mishap...probably her first bad lp....Nana Mouskouri's Canadian Tribute lp is MUCH BETTER featuring unusual tunes done in unusual ways and paying tribute to a broader base of Canadian Talent.
What about Randy Bachman?
Why do we have to do the same old ones again that EVERYONE does a cover of.
And no one will ever match Joni doing it.
Get Joni's hits instead of this lp and Krall's Live in Paris.
Same with Cohen.
And as for Joni's lovely song A Case of You, Diana Krall does a much more original version on her Live In Paris lp.
The one star is for the lp cover and concept.

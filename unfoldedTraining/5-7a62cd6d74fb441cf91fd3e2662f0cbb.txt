I said that 3 years ago, and now I've read every vampire related novel in the library so I sighed and picked it up, desperate for something to read.
When I picked up this book my thought's were "Mystery?

They're excellent and keep you on your toes trying to solve the mysteries that come up in every novel.
He's so suave, and smart.
When I got it home and started I was still leery, but soon I was hooked.

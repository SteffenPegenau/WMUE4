I say it is a wonderful day, because I found Jesus and I turned my life around.
My life was falling apart.
I always feel that this CD was what helped me become a believer in Christ.
I was a broken man.
The title is fitting to where I was in my life at that time: "Almost There".
The songs are joy to hear.
I was not a Christian.
My wife and I worked out our differences and I finally admitted to my faults.
My wife and I separated after 12 years of marriage and it did not look good.
I was staying with my parents when I first heard the song "I can only Imagine" on a soft rock station.
That was the night I gave myself to Jesus.
The music is wonderful.
I was in tears by the end of this song.
This CD reminds me that wonderful day.
It gave me the nudge that I needed.

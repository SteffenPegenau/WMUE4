if you are an Outsider fan, whatever you do, DON'T GET THIS SPECIAL EDITION MOVIE!
Really, the worst part about this edition is the music.
This special edition is the worst movie I've ever seen.
it is a great story, filled with great characters.
it just ruins the movie.
Just stick with the origanal.
it totally ruined the moment.
You see, I love the Outsiders.
I've wanted the movie for a long time.
it is horrible!
Than i finally got the special edition one.
And, the added scenes in the movie are totally unnessary.
It's much better, and presents the story in a much more memerable way.
For instance, in the scenes were Dally dies and Jhonny kills the scos, their playing rock and roll music!
And the music is constanly playing, so it's hard to concintrate on the movie.

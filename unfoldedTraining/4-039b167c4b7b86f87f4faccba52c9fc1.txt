I had to divide the beans over two separate trays and it is still too much.
It has just been a trial and error type thing.
I just need clearer instructions.
Of course I used 2 1/2 and it was way too much again.
I am currently sprouting mung beans and the instructions say to use a cup of beans.
The headings are not specific enough, so I had trouble understanding what each column was trying to tell me.
The instructions also say to cover the sprouts and in the next sentence, they say it is not necessary to cover the sprouts.
Other than instruction problems, the actual sprouter has been great.
The alfalfa sprouts turned out great.
So far my sprouter has been great.
and in another it said 2 1/2 tablespoons.
The biggest problem I had in the beginning was that the instructions were not clear to me at all.
That was way too much.
Again the problem was that in one place on the instructions it said to use 1 1/2 tbsp.
The chart is very vague as well.

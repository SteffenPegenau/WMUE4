Wish there were more like this.
to be cherished and encouraged.
I greatly enjoyed this movie and liked it the best of all 4 of them.
I know others will disagree, but if you just want a dreamy, fairy-tale romance, this is it!
She did great in the first one, but Kam is more refined and flows better in this part.
She makes it more believable.
I think they did a tremendous job.
I think Kam brings an elegance to the character that Julia didn't have as a "queen-to-be".
Laugh and cry.
It's just a happy movie in the midst of real life.
A get away and relax.
Luke does a regal job and is very cute too!
Happily ever after!
Deep down we all want to have a relationship where we admire and support one another.
I know there are alot of negative reviews about this movie, but I disagree.
.
She has tremendous character and self-control and really shows her love by her actions.
Since we have to live in reality, why not enjoy a fairy tale that ends happy?
More like a queen, than a farm girl.

i got the 2gb this time.
so easy.
one battery lasts a long time even for 5-6 hour training runs.
the headphones still suck and are obviously not made for runners so i'm using some from sony that have more comfortable earbuds.
i love that i just pull it apart & it is it's own usb to my computer.
i searched high and low to see if there was anything better for running and did not find it.
the technology has improved since my last purchase and while it won't shuffle between folders, each folder will now hold 500 songs.
it's a great product and a huge value for the money.
no wires.
the flash memory is perfect for the jarring it takes.
it has an optional belt clip (i hate the arm thingy).
also, i love the fact that it uses 1 AAA battery.
it's the smallest thing out there that's not an i-something.
no recharger necessary.
my first (the zen nano plus) lasted over 2 years through rain, sweat, dirt (trail running).
this is my second creative mp3.

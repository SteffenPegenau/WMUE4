I never bought Anthony Hopkins as a psycho in any of these in the series.
Two stars for the always interesting Harvey Keitel.
Poor casting is just the beginning of the problem.
This is an almost word for word remake of the 1986 film "Manhunter."
Silly.
Why did someone decide to remake a prefectly good film?
While watching this one I kept asking myself why.
In this one he plays it way over the top in an almost cartoonish manner.
This was the choice to make it different from Manhunter?
Ed Norton does an OK job as Will Graham, but this role could have been done equally well by anyone.
This remake adds nothing, in fact it is inferior to Manhunter in many ways.
Most annoying is Ralph Fiennes as the Tooth Fairy.
This guy sleepwalks through the role and is about as authentic as a wooden nickel.
The film concludes with a lame "he's not really dead" cliche.
Skip this one and rent the far superior Manhunter instead.

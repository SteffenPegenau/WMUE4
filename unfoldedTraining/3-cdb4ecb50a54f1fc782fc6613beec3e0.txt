I could not decide whether to return it yet.
I think for about $50 it is a good deal.
Frankly, I prefer heavier coats.
The cut does not look good.
I have ordered one at size 6.
The quality is fine.
I am not sure if I am going to be able to wear a thick sweater under this coat.
My main problem with the coat is that it does not have any interest, seam line etc.
It looks like a judge's black robe on me.
It is not my taste at least.
It is a bit tight fit.
You may want to consider one size bigger.
The fabric looks fine.
But, I bought the coat for cold weather.
It looks better when not buttoned up.
I am not sure about the appearance though.
Also, when I opened the box, my first impression was that it was not heavy at all for a long coat.
That's why I give 3 stars.

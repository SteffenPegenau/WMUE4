I didn't think the band was the Stones!!
IT SOUNDS LIKE A DIFFERENT, AND NOT VERY GOOD, BAND.
A lot of these songs are from the concert they gave that was broadcast live on (now defunct) ON TV.
Then when STILL LIFE came out, I saw it was from the same show.
And I thought, THIS BAND IS DOING A TERRIBLE RENDITION OF A STONES' SONG.
STILL LIFE shows why.
But then half way through the song, I realized it WAS the Stones.
I didn't have ON TV in 1981, but I listened to the simulcast on the radio.
Being a Stones freak, I taped the show, anyway.
I turned on the radio to here "Let's Spend the Night Together" playing.
They sounded too terrible.
I really only like their studio albums.
Mick's voice sounds NOTHING like his voice on the studio albums.
But I didn't know it was going to be on when I turned on the radio in my kitchen as I made dinner.
The Stones get really sloppy when they play live, and it drives me nuts.
And it had that flacid live feel I'd heard on the radio.

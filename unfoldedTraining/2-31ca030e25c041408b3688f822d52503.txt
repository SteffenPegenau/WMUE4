Wash them by hand.
These new light blue topped pitchers CANNOT be put in the dishwasher.
They warp and the lids no longer fit.
Mr. Coffee needs to address this issue.
I ordered another replacement pitcher and added one more just to have a backup.
They arrived today and I put one new one in the dishwasher and it warped.
My original pitcher is wash every 3-4 days (we drink a lot of tea) and it has never warped.
The first one my son was replacing the lid after washing it in the dishwasher and it didn't fit, so as any good teenager would do, he forced it, cracking the pitcher.
I have had a Mr. Coffee iced tea pot for 9 years.
I am glad I ordered two.
However, this past year I have ordered 3 new replacement pitchers.
I am glad I ordered two new ones this month.
I never really looked to see what caused it to break.
I use it daily and LOVE IT!
So BEWARE of the newer plastic pitcher.

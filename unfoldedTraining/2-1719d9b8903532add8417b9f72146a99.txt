What was up with the father?
This book was a bit of a disappointment storywise.
Does he represent a typical Igbo man with power?
Nice that the evil government allows the 3 of them to inherit all of Bad Daddy's money to squander as they wish and live happily ever after without Bad Daddy around.
Did he have a psychological disease?
The ending was bad.
Was it supposed to be because he was so stressed out by the evil government that he had to take it out on the powerless people who loved him?
It was very slow to get going.
The angelic priest was not an Igbo, was he?
The author couldnt make up her mind.
The son must have done it, cause the premise of the book is that Igbo men with power are evil.
Why did he have such little empathy for his family?
The father was a monster who was equally as bad as the vile government.
Did the son or the mother do it?
Either one doing it makes them equally as bad as the father.

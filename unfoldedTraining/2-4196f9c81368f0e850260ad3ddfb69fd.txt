However, if you collect Bette movies then you must own this one.
It had nothing to do with the movie, but it was funny.
No, wait!
I don't think so.
It gets one extra star because I did laugh twice, and one scene was very funny.
Ken Wahl as a love interest for Bette?
Its safe there will be no sequel, and I think she's learned not to do lame comedies.
Despite her screen presence even the multi-talented Bette Midler could not save this lame-ass attempt at a black(cat) comedy.
Well you really can't count that sitcom, can you?
Its a stink-a-roo.
I have never given a Bette Midler movie a bad review, but this one IS BADDDDD!!!
Ouch!
This movie makes "Rhinestone" shine if one could imagine that possible.
The best performance comes from Rip Torn and he dies half way into the picture.
He looked like he wanted to leave the movie, hunt down his agent, "Wiseguy" style and waste 'em.
Its so bad the DVD comes with its own odor.

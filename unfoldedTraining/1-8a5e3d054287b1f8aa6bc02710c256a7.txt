I am going back to a pencil and paper for the scheduler.
There was nothing that I could do.
Well, it was not.
All was lost.
Unfortunately, the actual Palm is a piece of junk.
Buy a real MP3 if that is what you want or if you really care what your music sounds like.The Tungsten E is jack of all and master of none when it actually works.
My new machine was dead, gone, no more.
I read all of the reviews for the Palm Tungsten E and thought that my experience would be better.
The Palm worked magnificently for the first 2 or 3 days.
Hopefully it fails before the anemic warranty runs out.Save yourself, DO NOT BUY THE PALM TUNGSTEN E.
It is easy to use and really great.
Then a fatal error occurred and the machine could not be reset.
When it does not, and most likely yours will fail too, you will want to toss it against the wall.
That was disheartening.
The best part of the Palm is the software for scheduling.
Also, the MP3 player in the palm is really substandard.

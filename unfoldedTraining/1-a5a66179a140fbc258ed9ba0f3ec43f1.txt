Everytime you get hit you see stars and you can't use your hammer awhile.
The game is at least playable but has no appeal.
All the bosses are no-brainers like Daffy Duck.
Even after you kill it,another one comes right away.
The plot is third-rate.
The ending is gargabe.
All you have to do is get the carrot.
I mean walking boxes with the letter S on them,little hammerhead guys,guys in trash cans,the flying fireballs but worst of all,the walking clocks becuase they're everywhere,you can't hit them without hurting yourself and when you kill them they explode like forever and you have to stand back.
No fighting him at all.
I give this game a 1 out of 10.
The side villians are weird.
It's also WAY too generous with the extra lifes.
For the third day of christmas I'm going to review...The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout.
Overall,NEVER BUY THIS GAME EVER!
Making a brithday-themed game is one of the worst ideas ever with a big name like Bugs Bunny.

It's extremely cheesy and about as awkward as having a sex talk at 13 with your father.I predict that in the future (like in 50 years), this kind of book will be a kitsch collector's item.
This book is ridiculous from beginning to end.Let's start with the title: "The Nice Girl's Guide to Sensational Sex".
For real?
It's just too funny.
Oh!
or from the team who brought us "Mink Coats for Animal Activists" Oh!
What group of people was the author targeting?In reality, this gem is too conservative to yield results for women trying to spice things up, and far too risqué for say...you're average Mormon 'nice girl.'
So I give it 2 stars just because it's funny.
I couldn't believe it when I saw this thing at the book store!
The result is neither cold nor warm, here nor there.
You're serious?
Is this from the people who brought us "Loose 60 pounds in 10 days on the Twinkie diet"?
Lemme guess it's from the publishers of "Healing the Dead".
That's the only reason I bought it.
Really?

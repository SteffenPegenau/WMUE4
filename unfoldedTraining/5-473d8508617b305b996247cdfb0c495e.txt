I RECCOMEND!
Like I said before.
But then at the ending I realize why.
When I first began to read this book, I was wondering why Stine kept on switching from time to time.
Shoppers who are reading my review, you will not regret buying this book.
It is just wonderful.
It has suspence, romance, horror and a totally heart sanking conclusion.
I was so shocked when i read the ending.
BUY THIS BOOK!
This is the BEST BEST BEST BEST BEST book that Stine has ever wrote.
I read it like five times in a row and I still plan on reding it again.
IT IS REALLY GOOD!
There is really one killer but in a way, there's really three.
That is how good and utterly creepy it is.
Then I also wondered why it was called beach house but the ending also explaines that too.
This book deserves more than 5 stars.

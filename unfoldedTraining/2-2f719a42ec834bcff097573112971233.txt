The entire movie was dialogue.
That's it.
It lasted roughly two hours, but it seemed like a good five.
I honestly thought that since I read so many good reviews of this film, it's going to pick up soon.
The movie was such a disappointment.
Naomi Watts and Edward Norton leading, two great actors.
There was no action whatsoever.
An interesting theme and issue, Cholera in China in 1920 and a great location to tease beauty from, but none of this is taken to its advantage.
The storyline seemed good, but, was this movie a bore!
It was so long and drawn out.
That's it.
The Painted Veil has it all going for itself.
But it never did.
Honestly, the only good thing about this movie was the scenery and acting.
I am not a lover of melodramas but if you want to see a good recent one, see The Lives of Others.
I was wondering when the heck this movie was going to end.

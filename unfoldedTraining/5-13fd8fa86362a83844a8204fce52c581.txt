I see they have the newer version at a lower price now.
The screen is sharp and clear, nothing like a computer screen.
It is extremely user friendly and you do not have to be tech savvy at all to use it.
No shipping costs anymore.
I already ordered all my books from Amazon before.
I purchased a great leather cover for my Kindle at a reasonable price right here on amazon.com.
Book space is no longer a storage issue.
You really cannot go wrong.
Recommend to anyone thinking of purchasing.
I really hope more magazines will be available though as I enjoy reading magazines, too.
Love the dictionary and ability to highlight also.
I love my Kindle.
Huge cost savings and I can "carry" all my books on one small device.
I can download a book in seconds...no wait time.
You can also order a sample of a book for free before purchasing to see if you want to purchase it BEFORE buying it (also it takes just a few seconds to download).

Stellan Skarsgard is great as usual.
4 digital cameras.
4 continuous shots.
Jeanne Tripplehorn is literally on screen in a continuous shot for the length of the film and she is fantastic.
The cast does a fine job, although I'm not exactly sure what Salma Hayak is doing in this company.
4 quadrants.
The reason I only gave this film 3 stars is that it didn't engage me.
Mike Figgis (Leaving Las Vegas) is definitely one of the most innovative directors out there.
All in real time.
Look out for Holly Hunter, who has very little screen time, but who gives her character more depth than this film deserves.
It wasn't as challenging as I thought it would be to follow all four quadrants at the same time.
And that's what makes the film worth seeing.
Figgis turns the volume up on the shot he wants you to pay attention to.
Watch it for its stylistic qualities and not for its story.
I recommend the DVD format.
After all, digital cameras deserve digital video.
All improvised.

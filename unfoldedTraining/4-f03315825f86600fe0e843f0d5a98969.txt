You've got to check out Screaming Lord Sutch.
The quality of this DVD is not up to todays standards, but still, you have to have this one in your collection.
This guy is nuts.
I also loved the interview with Little Richard.
Lord Sutch also has a stripper in his act that I enjoyed.
And by the way, is that Ritchie Blackmore playing the guitar for Lord Sutch?
Rock and Roll meets the Haunted Mansion.
They give you a brief glimpse of the lead guitar player.
Some might say its so bad its good.
I loved this DVD.
He's nuts too.
The Killer lives!
Before there was Kiss or Marylin Manson, their was Screaming Lord Sutch.
Also check out Jerry Lee Lewis pounding that piano.
Right on, Richard.
It looks like a young Ritchie Blackmore; I know he played for Lord Sutch early in his career.
I love his quote "It's not the size of the boat that makes you seasick; its the waves in the ocean".
It's very campy.

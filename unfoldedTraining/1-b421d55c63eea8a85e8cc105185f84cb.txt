And, I do.
7 weeks later, and calling every day their customer service was opened, I got a replacement.
Oh, the TV was 1 week out of warranty when this occurred.
Sorry....
Let them whither and die.
An impossibility I was told on LCD televisions.
On second thought, not even a memory, just a rumor that they actually once existed and made bad products.
I've had the replacement for 14 weeks.
Save your money for a few more weeks, buy a better, more company-backed, television.
DO NOT BUY Westinghouse.
Please save yourself the trouble.
Westinghouse sucks.
A bad memory of a company.
I sent it back at my cost.
The first one I bought lasted an astounding 1 day.
I know I have black line burned into the right side of the screen.

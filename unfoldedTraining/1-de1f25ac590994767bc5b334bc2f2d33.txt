But they have major flaws in the development of this ball.CONS: Sorry there are more cons then pros.Does not make ice cream in 15 minutes as instructions say.
This has sharp plastic edges that souround ball and hurts your hands.LEAKS.
Its a pretty colored ball.
$.30 cents for sugar.
$35.00 for the ball itself.
!Ok pros.
$.o5 cents for vanilla.
$2.05 for half and half.
You need more of a crushed ice.After 48 minutes you get board and well give up.After your hands are red and sore you give up.The to find out that you only get less then 2 cups of ice milk there was a waist of 48 minutes.
We tightened this up as much as we could and it leaked.Regular ice cubes will not work.
Ok I think who ever invented this was trying to do good.
Try 48 minutes for ice milk.Hurts when you roll it back and forth.
and because of the leaks IT IS NOT WORTH IT I could have went to Kings Soopers for $1.88 and picked up a half galon carton for less pain and money.DO NOT BUY!!!!
pain.
Yes this leaks.

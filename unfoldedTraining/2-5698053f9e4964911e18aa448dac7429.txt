I regret buying it.
It turned out fine.
The sleeves were for a gorilla.
But I stopped knitting many years ago.
Last year I bought some cheap acrylic yarn that I liked.
In general all the patterns are for very loose items that may make you look heavier.
Thus, you really don't know how the sweater is supposed to fit.
The is a huge tunic designed by Marc Jacobs that requires four pounds of yarn.
But I had to adapt to the instructions for the medium size.
Then I tried with another cardigan.
Really, if I had follow the instructions it would've been a disaster.
There are two or three that are really unwearable.
I didn't know what to knit.
So, although I think the patterns are all easy, it may not so easy to adapt for yourself if you're a beginner.
The model has a face that is shouting "please take this stuff from me".
I got this book and I made one cardigan, very easy.
I do knit.
Something that I noticed is that in most of the pictures the girls, very slender, are using bigger sizes.

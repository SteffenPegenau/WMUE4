Just weak.
Awful!
I would have expected more from her.
Don't get me wrong all of the songs aren't bad.
My CD's in the resale pile.
I'm not sure what CD the other reviewers are listening to but its sure not the copy I have.
Well, what a disapointment.
Belt out powerful songs.
Her "Can't fight fate" CD was a masterpiece.
If you purchase this CD you will be sadly disapointed.
Find a new graphic designer to do the covers.
Sad that she can't get it together anymore.
Only problem is no one wants it.
I was very excited to hear that Taylor had a new CD only to be shocked by the weak song writing and poor graphics.
Taylor should leave the writing up to others and stick to doing what she does best.

This book gives lots of suspense.
I loved this book and I hope you enjoy or enjoyed this book too.
If the X-Men did not have team work in this book, they would have been defeated.
This emerald gives Juggernaunt strong powers.
It has lots of adventure and action.

This book was one of the best books I've read.
Since there is another emerald in the same dimension, who ever wears it will make Juggernaunt weak.
This book also teaches teamwork.

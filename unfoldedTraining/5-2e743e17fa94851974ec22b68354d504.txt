Today Melanie has lost much of her voice.
It is an amazing album and a great tribute to a misunderstood artist.
She was an artist searching for an appropriate genre to fit her voice.
On this album Melanie sounded comfortable in the rock genre.
At her worst, " As I See It Now" ( Bad country). "
It would have certainly put Melanie on the top.
Melanie's future as a vocalist is over, but as a writer it has, hopefully, just started.
"Photograph" was her most mature work, but at times, she sounded forced.
At her best, " Gather Me", " Stoneground Words" and " Madrugada" she was a force to be taken seriously.
( Bad Disco!!!!).
But, as a songwriter she has matured nicely.
Too bad very few will get to hear the brilliant songs she is currently writing.
Too bad this album never found an audience.
Her voice was never better and her phrasing is pure bliss.
Melanie's career had many musical detours.
Arabesque" ( too middle of the road and not enough vocal challenges) and " Am I Real or What?"

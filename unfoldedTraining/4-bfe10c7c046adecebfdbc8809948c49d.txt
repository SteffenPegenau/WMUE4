It's has a catchy tune and powerful beat that still goes with the lyrics.
This CD single has three remixes of the song "Danger!
This one is good, even though it sounds nothing like the original "Danger!
High Voltage".
The third track is the Kilogram Remix.
The first track is the Soulchild 12" Blitz Mix.
High Voltage".
High Voltage" with an 80's rap beat.
It's pretty much an extended version of the original song with dance interludes thrown in.
The second remix is the Thin White Duke Mix.
Overall, this is a decent single.
This one is my least favorite of the three.
It's basically a combination of the tune of "Danger!
I would get it just for the awesome Soulchild remix, if nothing else.
The two may sound okay by themselves, but they don't go good together.
This the best remix and is easily worth the whole CD.

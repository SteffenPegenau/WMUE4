I knew that I loved this song that much.
I think these girls can pretty much release a song with them snoring and it would go number one.
Track 5 is a new Christmas song from them called "8 Days of Christmas."
That's what I did.
But, I figured buying this over the soundtrack was the lesser of two evils.
It contains a little Santana-like guitar in the background, and is faster paced.
How much longer can they have success talking about no good men and being able to buy what they want?
I am concerned, though.
In fact the vocals were redone for this version.
Buy this maxi single ONLY if you don't want to buy the "Charlie's Angels" soundtrack.
Let me start off by saying that the song "Independent Women" is a 5 star song.
Unfortunately my CD is in my car, but I can tell you that track 4, which is one of the dance mixes is a great mix.
Generally I don't like maxi-singles because if you have heard one dance mix, you've heard them all.
This isn't an exception.
It's pretty good.

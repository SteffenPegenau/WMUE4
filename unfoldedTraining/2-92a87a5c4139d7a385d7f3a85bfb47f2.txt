They even put Kurt at #12 for 100 greatest guitarists.
Nirvana was a good band, but please do not put them in the same class as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin etc.
So bash all the classic rock bands I listed, but you'll soon realize that each of them have contributed way more to rock and music in general.
Nevermind is extremely overrated and thank goodness I never bought it.
Let's be serious.
If you're going to get a Nirvana album, get Bleach or In Utero.
Kurt wasn't even good w/ guitar in the first place.
They were a fad.
Don't listen to mags like Rolling stone or Spin b/c they're liars.
Good songwriter, bad guitarist.
That's a joke.
This is an ok album.
Nirvana was popular for only one song and we all know which one that is.
Hopefully I helped you a bit.
Nirvana wasn't even around for 10 years.
A straight up fad.
Those bands have more classic songs under thier belt and lasted for more than a decade.

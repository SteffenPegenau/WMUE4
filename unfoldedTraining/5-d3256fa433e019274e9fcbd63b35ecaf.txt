But when I listened to it and I was definitely not disppointed from it.
This single is a good recommendation if your sick of her latest scoop hip-hop songs that don't even suit her properly.
It just moved me.
!
In fact it was the real star of the single in the first place anyway.
It was an import here though.
I figgured.
Frankly Mariah please return to us the way you were before.
You were meant for this!!!
I was skeptical at first after I bought this single from a music shop.
Before we all put you to the shelves if you know what I mean.
This ballad reminded me of the Mariah Carey I knew in the old days when I actually started to go all crazy about her music and her voice.
why can't she just keep singing songs and stuff like this?
What's more it was where she got her fame for anyway.
I loved the ballad There For Me.
She usually so good and has done it for many years.

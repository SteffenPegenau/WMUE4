or even nintendogs for DS.
sometimes all you do i click and it gives u points for no reason!
anything is better and more funner than this!
I played this game on yahoo (A demo) and didnt liked it at all.
it is very boring.
wont change at all!
so its really easy getting money and buying your pet things.
i suggest u get dogz or catz for pc.
the ball/frisbee goes the same direction everytime!
the dog catches the same way every time.
the toys are boring and the contests are VERY easy to win.
it makes u bored very soon.
when u play with your dog the toys do the SAME FREAKING thing every time!
just watch your dog walk for 30 seconds and pee.
When you go on a walk, you dont even do anything.

Those two in combination tells you they're not going away.
It wasn't till I listened to track 3 that I realized who they were, "this is Blyss" I yelled.
A few of the Blyss songs are on the No name face album but I have to tell you their best song ever "Reaching" is only on the Blyss CD.
I think its a crime that its taken this long.
I was in virgin records the other day when my friend asked me to listen to this song.
What can I say I'm a long time fan.
I loved it (hanging by a moment).
If you ever see the Blyss "Diff's lucky Day" album grab it.
This boy can write and this boy can sing.
It seems he can't go wrong.
I love all of their songs but I really like Quasimodo.
They have unique perspective lyrically and musically.
They are amazing and Jason is a natural writer/singer.
I bought the Blyss CD 2 years ago and have always felt they had huge potential.
Its a piece of history.

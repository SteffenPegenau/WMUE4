GET THIS MOVIE!
Then, bring Ernest into the picture!
GET READY TO BE BLOWN AWAY!
I was scurred, but I knew everything would turn out right with THE 3 NINJAS AND DAVE DRAGON!
And mix it all up at MEGA FLIPPIN' MOUNTAIN!!
I used to love to go to mega mountain as a kid, and now we have a 3 NINJAS movie right there!
That's right, I said HULK HOGUN!
NOt only the 3 NINJAS, but HULK HOGUN!
MEGA MOUNTAIN!
!
Throw HULK HOGUN into the mix!
This movie was dangerous!
Then Tum Tum will rock your crotch!
First, you get non-stop, crotch-knockin', light-up-the-eyes ninja action!
What more could you ask for?
They had guns, and they were taking over the park, but guess who saved the day?
Watch out!
You'll get your eyes lighted-up!
Nobody in their right mind would EVER mess with Dave Dragon.
You couldn't possibly get anything better in a movie!

Fritty went all that way only to discover THIS!
1) the part where Fritty goes to that cat-mound-hell-underground place whatever.
I love books.
THAT is a good animal-as-main-character book.
Too depressing.
Too dark.
This was before I read Watership Down.
Read WATERSHIP DOWN by Richard Adams.
There are two parts that REALLY drag this book down.
Too boring.
This isn't.
Finally, let me ask you this: Which book sounds more interesting: Tailchaser's Song, where a male cat is trying to find his missing she-cat OR Watership Down, where some rabbits are trying to escape extinction both by man and their own kind.
I love cats.
Tailchaser's Song.
Sure it's a surprise ending, but it's the type of surprise ending that makes you sick.
It reminded me of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Dante's Inferno.
I decided to read a book about cats.
2) The ending wa a BIG letdown.
The way I felt after reading the last line in Orwell's 1984.
But even then, I didn't find this book all that great.

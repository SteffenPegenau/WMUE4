The soldier ate out of cans, Surrendering Jap Soldiers.
NOT, only officers got fresh fruit.
Americans did not hang out with the Natives,ect.
My advice don't waste the time with this movie.
!
Only one liked it.
He tryed to save it but gave up.
Surrender was not in their code.
Penn was the only person in the movie I liked.
So many historical mess ups that this 1000 words can't describe, like fresh fruit for the soldiers??
The 1st time in the theather with 10 friends.
In my opinion this movie is a slap in the face of OUR American Vets who were there!!
I have watched this film three times.
As a WW 2 Reenactor I am talking to many Vets and this movie is nothing about them or what they did.
Not many surrendered anywhere.
Maybe the next Hollywood movie on the Pacific Theather will be better, can't get any worse then Thin Red Line!

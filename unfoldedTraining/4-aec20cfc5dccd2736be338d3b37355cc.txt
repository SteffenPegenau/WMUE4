Risk isn't a big classic compared to Axis.

So why did I give the 3 stars to educational value and durablity?

(Fifty bucks can be spent on much better things).

I didn't learn anything new from the game, and it's not too durable either, not that it needs to be.The fact is, the game is amazing, and is up there in the ranks with Clue and.
Because that is the truth: both factors are nothing significant.
Clue's ilk.
if one is willing to sacrifice the time AND money.

It was so interesting I could hardly put it down.
The book kept me guessing throughout the entire story.
Even when I put it down I kept wondering what was going to happen next.
It is a good book for any age girl.
It is a perfect book for every girl.
I could see myself there.
Hi,My name is Taylor.
I read Beacon Street Girls.
I felt like I was one of the Beacon Street Girls.
You never knew what to expect next.
I hope you will be as excited as I to read the next book and tell your friends.
It has all the personalities of every girl, so anyone can relate to it.
It was a really great book.
I would highly recommend this book to any girl of any age.
I know you will enjoy this and be glad you read it.

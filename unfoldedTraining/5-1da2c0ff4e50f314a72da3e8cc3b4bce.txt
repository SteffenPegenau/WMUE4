For us it has held up quite well after being thrown numerous times (knock on wood).
He still enjoys it now that he is 13 months old.
Very good for young children.
I bought this for my son when he was 7 months old.
That bothers me because I would like children to hear music in tune.
The toy is just slightly out of tune.
I disagree with some of the reviewers who wrote that the toy was not very durable.
It is not "noisy" like other musical toys.
However, I have to say one thing bad about it.
At first my nanny would push the buttons for him, and he would stare transfixed at the toy for a long time, sometimes lulled to sleep eventually.
As he grew older he figured out how to push it to change tunes.
The tunes grew on us, too.
One other good thing about it is that it has got no sharp corners whatsoever.
I highly recommend it.
I think the way you can add or take away instruments is very good for developing children's musical ear.

I get that she went through something before Shakespeare but come on.
She keeps to herself.
Even people who are trying to be nice to her she's sort of abrupt and short with.
It just makes the story hard to swallow and not fun at all.I vote to skip this one next time.
I do want to try one more but I almost feel like I'm putting myself through something I don't need to.
She cleans home's and business.
It's common courtesy to be polite.
Yet, Lily isn't.
She makes an anonymous call.I was at about page 56 when I was thinking, this chick is awful.
She really dislikes everyone.
I read all of Charlaine's Southern Vampire Mysteries so far with good results.
Unsure of whether or not to report it for fear that it will bring up her past.
However, when I jumped into this book Shakespeare's Landlord I felt let down tremendously.This book is about Lily Bard who's been through something traumatic.
She's relocated and changed her life.
While out one night walking she see's something.

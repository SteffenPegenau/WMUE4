First, the blood.
Six of them, if memory serves.
UN.
This movie delivers both.
I dug it and plan to buy it when I can find it for $14.99 or below.
The sleeping bag kill and the surprise bow and arrow kill, especially, are magnificent.
boobs.
the first two are kinda weird looking.
And how!
Correct me if I am wrong but it is my understanding that the only reasons anyone would watch a Friday the 13th movie are 1.)
The last two are unreal.
The murders in this movie are, more often than not, spectacular.

The next two are nice.
Jason's tunnels and frontier-style early warning systems were a nice touch, though.
Next, we have the boobs.

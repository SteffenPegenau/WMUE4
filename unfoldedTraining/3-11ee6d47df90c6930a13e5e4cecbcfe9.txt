ok?I like Enrique's voice.
Despite the lofty praises of the other reviewers, this album is not the second coming of the messiah.
But let's be honest.
"Muchas Flores" by Rosario is a much better album (for example)Luis Miguel, Jerry Rivera, Luis Fonsi.
I like Enrique.
He isn't "the most talented modern male singer I've heard in years" as one put it and this isn't "definitely one of the best Spanish speaking albums out" as another put it.
Quizas is decent and I especially like "Mentiroso".
and I like many of his songs.
etc they all have better voices.
But don't expect this to be your reason for living.
So no.. this is not like Ricky Martin's last album.
(Thank God) If you appreciate latin music and not american pop i spanish, buy thi salbum.
Don't get me wrong.
But let's keep things real.also, I am glad that this is NOT an english album in spanish version.
Why do norteamericanos all think that spanish albums by spanish artists are american songs sung in spanish?

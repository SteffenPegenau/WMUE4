It was the only way I could get anything done, because, she wanted to be held ALL THE TIME.
Great product, and serves same purpose as more expensive ones.
She loved being able to face outward and look around while I cleaned the house.
It did take a little while to figure the thing out.
(9 mo.
It's also great for taking places that strollers don't fit.
I used it mostly when my daughter was colicky.
I bought this for our 1st baby, because, I wanted one of everything.
I would definately reccomend this to any new mom.
)I tried to use the backpack feature, but, I am way too paranoid about safety.
(As far as how to adjust it to make it fit right.)
Just in case I needed it.
Then it was a breeze.
It didn't feel as secure as it did wearing it on the front.
I used it until she was about 20 lbs.

Usually I try to offset the state sales tax (8.25% in the DFW area)with the shipping and handling charge.
The coffee cost $9.50.
I will definitely find Costa Rican coffee in my local area and buy from a brick & stick store.
There seems to be a trend of increasing shipping and handling costs.
My beef is with the outrageous shipping charge for a 12 oz.
Soon we will all be paying sales tax AND shipping charges through on internet sales unless something keeps us from paying ANOTHER tax which will surely affect the internet market.
That was about $10.
No more Britt through Amazon for me.
sealed bag of coffee.
I don't have an issue with the product or the price for the product.
The shipping box was big enough to hold ten bags of coffee.
Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of Britt coffees and Costa Rican coffees.
Why not just a sturdy envelope?
Anyway, just my 2 cents worth.
Local sales tax on this purchase would have been in the range of $0.80.

This was not as good as I had hoped...it was nothing that I has expected.
I dont know what to say because Kelly is better than this album.
She could've done far better than she did.
I commend LeToya she had her own sound and the album was great.
Sorry but thats my opinion.
I had high hopes for this album after I heard the first single.
I was so ready for this album and I was so disappointed.
Kelly please come up with your own sound and leave Destiny Child alone.
I gave Kelly 2 stars only because her single with my girl Eve.
It seemed as though Kelly tries the Destiny Child sound without the other girls...and that was not a good idea.
Oh my God.
I see why Beyonce came out with her album when LeToya came out with hers.
My hopes are now destroyed.
I enjoyed LeToya album better than Kelly's.
If Kelly would've come out with LeToya...Kelly would've been out shined.

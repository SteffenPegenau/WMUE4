There is a guy from school that gives her headaches.
Erin's life gets settled.
She started to get this because her younger sister, Amy, died a year ago.
the main characters are Erin, David, a guy from Erin's school,and Erin's parents.It took place in a therpist office and at school.
The book is perfect.It's like what might happen in real life.
There was one thing I couldn't understand.
But this book was sort of borning.
My friend Kelly loves her books.
She would actually read this book.
The major theme is telling your parents what is happening to you and your life.I kind of like this book.
I chose this book becaues I love Lurlene McDaniels' book.
Her parents suggested that she would see a thrapist to talk to her.
If you like problems with life stories you must read Lurlene McDaniel's "Time to Let Go".
What happen was Erin is a girl who happens to get headaches.
the conflict is that Erin is having bad headaches and bad nightmares.

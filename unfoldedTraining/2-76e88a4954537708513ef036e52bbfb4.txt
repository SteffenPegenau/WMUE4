I went on line.
As I dug out my invoice from my Jan. order, I found they were $41.00 then.
What set off this writing is.
I am sure I can settle for this product from many companies that advertise for some 25% less.
I was introduced to Giant Sunflower Seeds while on a fishing trip in Oregon.
I think I have ordered 3 times, may be 4.
I am old but not stupid.
Today I was going to reorder.
Each time the seeds get smaller, and smaller.
When I returned home they were hard to find.
I had written the Co. about this last year, got no response.
I liked how large they were, (and not too much salt).
bags was $48.00.
The last I got in Jan. were no different than any number of others sell.
The price for 6.5 oz.

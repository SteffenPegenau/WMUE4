`Film Preview of 1946`.
One not bad as in wicked, but more thoughtless and spiteful.
There is plenty of drama and action to follow.Bette has a very large wardrobe as she plays the twins.
The first film mentioned, as a big forthcoming attraction was `A Stolen Life`.
Glenn Ford is the kind twin`s find and she keeps him away from her sister for as long as possible.
It is not a bad film, nor is it a super film.
Inevitably the thoughtless twin takes over, and then marries him.
The kind twin carries on with her life as best she can.
Bette plays the identical twins.
My first film book was purchased in 1945.
The other twin is of course, kind, gentle and undemanding.
Quite daring in those days I think.
She wears trousers quite often.
She and Kathryn Hepburn are the women we have to thank for getting us out of skirts and stockings and into the much more comfortable trousers we wear today.A real old fashioned melodrama.
Now, after all these years I finally have a copy.

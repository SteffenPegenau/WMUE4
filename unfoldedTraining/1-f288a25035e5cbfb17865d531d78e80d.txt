It wasn't even a FUNNY kind of bad, like I Still Know What You Did Last Summer or Urban Legend.
I have never seen worse acting.
But I guess if you like watching bad movies, you'll enjoy this.
I just don't understand!
I like horror movies, but this one is bad.
If you like movies that have awful acting, awful plots, and are simply unrealistic, this movie is for you!
Especially in that car scene at the beginning.
What were they THINKING?
oh.. they WEREN'T thinking...ANYWAY, please, I'm begging you, do NOT waster your time and hard worked for dollars on this amazingly bad "movie".
I mean, come on!
It's by far the worst "horror" movie ever, and believe me, I've seen them all!
It was, in four words: AN EMBARRASSMENT TO MANKIND.
I like cheesy teen horror movies, but this was just TOO bad.
Actually, maybe not.
And THAT's pretty bad.I guess the most atrocious thing in this movie is the simply horrible acting.OH MY GOD.
I mean, jeez, this is even worse than Urban Legends:Final Cut!

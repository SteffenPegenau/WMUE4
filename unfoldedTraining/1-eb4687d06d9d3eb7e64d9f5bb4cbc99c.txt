If you haven't read this book: don't read it!
I hated them both and I hated their relationship!
How can I forget about the drugs!
Now, the book is horrible!
Oh, and of course!
I wasn't a super big fan of the show anyway, though I liked the episodes I watched.
I didn't like the movies, I found them childish.
This book is plane terrible!
Run while you can!
I can understand that it doesn't resemble the TV show or the movies.
They are high all the time!
I was expecting a book portraying strong, independent, intelligent women, but what I actually found was a bunch of seemingly poor women who didn't have enough money to pay the rent, spending their money on expensive bags and coats and sleeping with rich guys just to get ahead.
I kept wishing for Carry to break up with Mr Big!
I was actually expecting that and I was curious about it.
Don't buy it!

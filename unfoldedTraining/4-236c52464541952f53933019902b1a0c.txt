After I saw what he was doing I pulled it out of his mouth.
He had a dust ball in his mouth that did not taste very good.
Like most kids he put his mouth around it.
He got over it but if I hadn't seen him with that in his mouth who knows how much more could of gotten in.
He sucked out a bunch of dust and dirt from the vacuum.
!
You will have to tape it.
The hose broke off with him pulling it a few times.
Other then that, he loves it!!!!
The house is always clean so this vacuum really does pick up things you never knew you had around.
I bought this for my 12 month old nephew.
And he has a lot.
He learned so much from it.
We have now super glued that part.
The only problem is that the cover comes off very easy.
Watched mommy and vacuumed with her.
So, if you think it doesn't pick up it really does.
He loves this vacuum more then any other toy he has.
And when you see your child starting to put the hose in their mouth watch out.

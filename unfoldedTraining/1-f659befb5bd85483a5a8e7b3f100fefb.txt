I paid $68 for it and it is still $68.
Amazon had it for $68 when I first saw it here, but what happened?
Not even the job boxes made of steel are $300.
Amazon can not be serious.
When I saved this to my wishlist it was listed for what the retail price really is $68.
They are very strong and great for what I need, but no way will I pay 2x more.
I was getting ready to order 8 of these to organize my life better, but when I did go back to order them they want more then $100.
Get it together Amazon so I can get them from you before I get all the ones I will ever need from elsewhere.
No way will I pay more for this than the retail price of $68.
This is plastic.
Where do they get the idea that the retail price is over $300?
Wow!
I geuss I will be buying mine from Home Depot again even if I can only get 2 at a time since that is how many they keep in stock at any one time.
I bought my first one from Home Depot and I love it.
It's not!

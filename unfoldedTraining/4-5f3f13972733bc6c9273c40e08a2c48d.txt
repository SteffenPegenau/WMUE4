My only issues with this gate is that the latch was a little difficult at first, but it seems to have loosened up a bit and got easier to open after about a day of use.
We bought this gate for two reasons - 1. we have a baby who will walk soon.
I also like the fact that you can leave it open; just open it up all the way and it stays.
We just got a puppy for said baby.
I would definitely buy again.
It works like we hoped and was well priced.
We got the bronze color gate and it looks very nice in our home aside from being sturdy and well built.
2.
I also wish there was more door space to go through.
The side rails are a little wide, making the door a bit narrow for my liking.
Both need to be contained.
I do, however, LOVE that it swings both directions and auto locks.
The door swings smoothly, everything works as intended.
Great feature.
Overall, I really do like it.

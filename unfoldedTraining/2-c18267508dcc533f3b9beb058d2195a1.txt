He was just one lost tortured soul clinging to memories of his dead love.
Fortunately, I have read some of her previous novels before reading this one.
You could probably bypass this one and not be missing out on much.
But I didn't see a whole lot of warmth in the hero.
I have just discovered Quinn.
The zaniness (is that a word?)
The plot was interesting in a convoluted manner but something I could forego in the future.
I am currently reading "Minx" which I am very much enjoying.
This book was ok...but if you could find her other books, I would recommend those first.
Her work is generally light hearted fun.
If I had started with this novel, I would not have continued reading her works.
He just didn't deserve the heroine.
I was disappointed with this book.
is still there.
However, I did like his friend.

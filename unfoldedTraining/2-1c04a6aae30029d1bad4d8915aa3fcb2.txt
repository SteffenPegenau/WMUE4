I'll give an account of the films' good points.
I hate warner bros animation.
The political correctness .
The good points were Cholina and Fievel.
The movie isn't some lame recap of the first.
The animation oh lord.
I thought kids movies were a safe haven from that.
Two stars for a good effort.
The acting [was no good].
minus three stars for political correctness.
Alright I thought it was lame.
The animation it was done by the crew that created animanics.
Okay.
They were true to themselves.
He was cute and spirited in the first movie.
Fievel he's more annoying in this movie.

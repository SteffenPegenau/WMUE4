And I don't know how she managed to live so long, with what she had to live with in those days.
I remember watching this movie when it came out.
I'm not sure anyone would want to make a movie about what Lady Day went through back then.
I thought it was ok. Until I read Billie Holiday's Autobiography.
She was young when she lost her life.
And when she didn't feel like it, she couldn't.
Read her book.
When are we going to wake up!
It's a beautiful, sad story...
Hence, the two stars.
God Bless.
Lady Day is the Greatest!
She has the most beautiful voice I've heard.
She could sing without even trying.
Which is still known to exist today!

But not enough to own.
If you own all of those, get any of Toshir Mifune's samurai films (not really the same style but will be a much better investment.)
Skip it.
(I cant get into it with out spoiling, sorry.)
Or if you are a die hard collector and need to expand go get another one of the Deadly Venom films.
Its mildly entertaining.
If you must get this, you've been warned, its amateur at best.
The Shaolin temple is only in the movie for a brief period.
The Master Killer isn't really "that other Master Killer."
There are a few money scenes, but it cant even begin to compete with other Shaw titles.
This movie has potential.
Or rent it.
Gordon Liu, Shaw Bros., Shaolin Master Killer.
Rent this movie.
Sounds tasty right?
The best part of the DVD are the extra fighting sequences provided as Special Features.
Admittedly, the fighting styles are things you have never seen before, but are really pretty lame.
The plot doesn't even begin to convey any drama or passion.

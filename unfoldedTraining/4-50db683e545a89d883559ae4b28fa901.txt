you need one to keep track.
i like that.
well worth the time and the money.
it doesn't matter what it makes me feel.
it was funny plain old fashioned funny.as my husband said, it's one of those rode map movies.
the mexican started out making you think.
i shows that the people who made it trusts us to really watch it.
i recomend this movie to anyone who likes comady, pitt, roberts and gandolphino.
the comady was fun the drama was dramatic and the storyline was very unique.
you had to watch it to be entertained.
i heard this movie was a dud.
just so i don't get get to the end and feel disapointed.
i like a movie that makes me feel something.
they don't wrap it up and hand it to you all nice and tidy.
the cast is so wonderful.
boy did i hear wrong.
happy, sad, reflective.
you know they had to like what they were doing.
it's a hoot.

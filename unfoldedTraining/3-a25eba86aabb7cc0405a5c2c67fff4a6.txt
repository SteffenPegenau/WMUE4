You know that little thing above you lip and below your nose?
One of my fave characters was Slally, the girl who talked in gibberish.
But when I read a book I don't like I always seem to remember all the parts that I DID like.
Well, Bently UNDERSTOOD her gibberish.
:) But I've seen good reviews for this book.
Bently doesn't have one.
So it could be your fave food or that yucky stuff that Mom insists that you'll love and 'eat it up now you'll thank me later.'
Some like it, I didn't.
Well you supposedly get it before birth when an angel presses her finger there and says 'shh' to keep you from telling the secrets of the world.
I won't tell you what it is though.
I must confess, I never finished it.
I never finshed the book but near the end I saw a sentence that added suspense to the book.
Whether or not you like this book depends on your taste in style of writing.
This book was a little slow for me at times, or boring.
Some fave details were the 'philtrum' myth.

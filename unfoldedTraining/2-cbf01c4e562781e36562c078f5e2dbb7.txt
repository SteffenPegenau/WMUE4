I tried another D-Link 713P.
But after a while the singal was gone again.
...
I tried other 3 PC Card (diff.
Better user interface and better looking (I think).
brand).
Plug and play!
No dice.
Forget it!
I was lucky that I was able to get a very good deal at amazon ...!
It seems that everytime I switched AP, my PC card had signal but very unstable.
I got a more expensive Linksys AP (w/ 4 port switch).
Then by switching to another AP, the singal was back.
i followed every word of the instruction but can't get the PC Card connect to it.
Wired!

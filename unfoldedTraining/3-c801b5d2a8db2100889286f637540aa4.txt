folks, this is escapist entertainment, pure and simple.
.
the widescreen aspect ratio reveals some beautiful photography and is a vast improvement over Goodtimes' LP-speed VHS cassette.
.
.
so the storyline about the Great White Shark following the surviving members of the Brody family to the Bahamas is ridiculous .
The Goodtimes DVD offers no extras other than the usual chapter breaks and English/French/Spanish subtitles.
One wonders whether Jaws 2 and Jaws 3 will ever be released on DVD.
Interestingly, up until Universal's DVD release of the original "Jaws" for the 25th anniversary in the late Spring of 2000, "Jaws, The Revenge" was the first and only DVD available in the four film saga.
OK .
Those looking for something deep and profound should look elsewhere.
Maybe Goodtimes will come to the rescue.
.
.
What a nice surprise the Goodtimes DVD turns out to be .

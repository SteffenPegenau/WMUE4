This album is overrated.
Machine.
However, most of this record is plain boaring and pathetic.
BEFORE YOU READ THIS....THIS IS NOT A REVIEW FOR FANS WHO SUPPORT B!MACHINE.
THIS IS A REVIEW FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NAIVE TO B!
PATHETIC!
I want to give a better rating to this boaring album...but I simply can't do that.
The first track 'angels' is kinda cool...and there are a few other tracks that are just ok.
MACHINE AND ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS ALBUM.
Let me say this again...BOARING.
Did I mention that it is boaring?
The album's cover art is cool...but in the end....this is some blase synth pop music that lacks a pulse....and not a cool Undead Pulse..rather, this is mostly just a dead end to B!
Ok, that was two more times...here's one more...BOARING!...-"This must be art, because it shure as hell is not entertainment."
BOARING!!!
---Pogo.
One more time so that it's perfectly clear....BOARING!

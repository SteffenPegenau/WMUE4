First set had freeze problems, which timeless did replace.
Others stay away.
(I want my money back).
FOR DIE-HARD FANS OF THIS WESTERN ONLY.
These prints are the quality of my over the air VHS tapes recorded at SLP of TV shows I have recorded.
If you want a western set from these early years get Wells Fargo.
Timeless should have created to two labels.
So-So color and worst scan job I have ever seen.
It has excellent prints, well-balanced and decent stories with guest stars of the period.
Yes, even the 60 shows, 10 DVDs @ $9.99 sets.
We could be for warned by which is great and which is trash.
Wells Fargo: TMG Premier Series.
Laramie: TMG Lost in the Dust Series.
([...]) I received the replacement set and while it plays ok there is a buzz coming from my Sony DVD player that makes it sound like it is hard at work to play intro and menu.
You can tell their source print is from tape.

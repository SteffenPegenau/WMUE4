The jack-ass guy is funny, as is the other.
She's a singer.
Ruining a classic show, that was what they were trying to do?
There are some..Tom Hanks/Rita Wilson that are examples of classic marriage.
Who wants to trust people who cannot even be married?
It will be the end.
I used to like Jessica, but she can't act.
Celebrities should stay within their realm and not vtry other things because it makes them look dumb.
Well, they did.
I don't think Jess will bounce back from this.
Others..well enough said.
Jessica & Nick looked happy, but now they are just ruining their lives and their careers.
The whole marriage system in the U.S. is now ruined due to these celebrities.
Tom Cruise would not have passed.
People put them on a pedestal and they should act within the pedestal they are put upon.On a personal note, celebrities should not be allowed to be married w/o major psych counseling.

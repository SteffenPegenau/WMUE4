And the acting, dialog and action are fantastic.
There is not one dull moment in this movie and you will be on the edge of your seat all the way to the end.
Bravo QT.
I did and I was alone in my living room.
Based in WW2 before the US invasion.
Inglorious Basterds is a remake but really it's a QT movie.
Bravo.
With great satisfaction.
I am blown away by QTs movies but this is by far his best.
And when it's over you will stand up and litearly applaud.
And it does.
Jewish american's gurilla force is used to scare the germans.
This movie is simply brilliant.
And QT brings an instant classic to film.
There is amazing blood and gore in this film.
QT is the master at creating tension in scenes to the point you think everything is about to burst.

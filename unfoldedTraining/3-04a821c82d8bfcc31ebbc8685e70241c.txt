Factory has done a nice job of remastering and the accompanying booklet is very informative.
This album was originally released in February of 1965; three months later Alpert would release his first No.
Factory has scheduled an April release for that gem.
Highlights include the title track, "The Girl From Impanema," the reworking of the Beatles' "All My Loving" and "The Mexican Shuffle," which was the only hit single off the album (peaking at No.
RECOMMENDED
6 on the album charts.
1 album WHIPPED CREAM AND OTHER DELIGHTS.
In fact, the only real clunker is the vocal track "Hello, Dolly!"
85) but it was given new life when used in a chewing gum commercial and redubbed "The Teabury Shuffle."
with its out-of-place Spanish accent.
While not quite as good as Herb Alpert's debut, 1965's SOUTH OF THE BORDER was a solid album that went to No.
In the meantime, SOUTH OF THE BORDER makes for a nice appetizer.
Enjoy!

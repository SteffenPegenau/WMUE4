Hold on the picture quality doesn't seem to be very good.
I don't know why they did this but these 3 pack blu-ray aren't the same as the normal blu-ray.
Hmmm, Video is AVC 32Mbps.
What a deal...right?
Wow a 3 pack of blu-ray for a little over twenty bucks.
Let me see my Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaur Blu-ray.
The sound is DTS-HD and they do contain the normal amount of secondary audio.
They are the watered down version.
They don't come with digital copy and they are only half of the normal resolution.
Well that's no good.
What does that mean?
Video is AVC 16Mbps ???
Only thing that made me mad is if I had wanted a watered down version I would have stayed with my upconverted DVD version which is basically what this is.
Tho they come in individual blu-ray cases.
What's this?

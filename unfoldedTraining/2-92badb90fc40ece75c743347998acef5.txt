Each only lasted about two years.
I found one on a leading online auction web site and purchased it for $20 (shipping included).
The old Farberware you remember built products in the Bronx.
It still outdid my newer ones in terms of performance and they both broke.
After finding this out, I decided to find a used Farberware percolator from the old company.
So I did a little research.
You'll be happy you did.
This model is built in China by a company that's not Farberware.
I've owned two of these.
Beware the brand names.
That company bought the name Farberware and uses it to sell products.
I expected more from Farberware.
One of the reasons I started buying these percolators is because my mother-in-law has had the same one for 20 years.
Know who really makes that product before you buy.
It has been everything I thought it would be and more.
They were built to last.

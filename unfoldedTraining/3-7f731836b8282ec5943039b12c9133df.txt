In fact they sent me the new replacement.
Cracks after prolonged time.
Sent me a new part.
If this lasts more then a few months I'll be back to give it one more star.
?UPDATE - 02/21/12Called Technical Support - Guess what?
But be careful....
Called Culligan.
It is clearly newly designed and no more cheap plastic.
Hopefully this one will last but only time will tell.Note - To avoid having the shower head fall down upon placing it in it's holder, put a towel around the connector and Monkey Wrench it tight!
Is it so hard Culligan to make it with another material??
That cracked after a few months.
Even Zinc can crack.....Revising my stars to 3.
Horrible.
Connector made of plastic.
They discovered a new material to make the part out of Zinc and no more plastic.

Ok I'll hit you with the bad news first.
when your main influence is Guns N Roses that doesn't make you metal.
If you are into hard rock i reccomend you dowload beast and the harlot, trashed and scattered, and seize the day but don't waste your money on the whole cd because the rest of it is complete crap.
Dimebag Darrell is rolling over in his grave.
Some of the worst singing I've ever heard in my life.
1.
It's like taking the most monotone tone deaf person in the world making him hold his nose and giving him a microphone!
2.
Now the good 1.
The guitar playing that's about it.
BTW I heard a sample of these guys covering walk by pantera (one of my favorite songs) and they completely butchered it.
The guitar playing is good but it's not great because i feel like they aren't used to the fullest extent of their abilities.
This band is not metal!
3.
I'm not into the whole clean vocal thing but jesus if you are going to sing make sure you can sing.

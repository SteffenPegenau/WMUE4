Then there were the "many people involved" matches.
but please dont buy it.
Basically, a lot of suckiness everywhere.
A few decently good matches were the 2 triple threats and the main event was decent.
Not an extended version of HeAT..Anyway, if u want to rent it just because its wrestlemania, than rent it.
WM16 was bad.
There was for some reason A LOT of buildup for this match.
The women's match was the only match that was 1 on 1.
Altogether though it was bad.
But obviously, it [is bad].
Its supposed to be WRESTLEMANIA!
ALL of them.
just too bad.
Kat vs Terri in a "cat fight".
The main event, the Triple threat Euro and I-C title matches, the Triple threat ladder match for the tag titles and even the womens match has many people involved.
The tag team matches were bad.

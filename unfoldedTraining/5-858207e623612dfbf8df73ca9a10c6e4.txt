I went home and watched it, and I was completely impressed.
I have to say this was a great purchase.
I have always liked musicals, so I thought 'why not?'
I think everyone is.
I would recommend it to anyone who likes musicals or likes any of the actors.And on a side note...Is there anyone that can say that Marlon Brando was not one of the most attractive men ever?
I bought this movie blind.
I had never seen Guys and Dolls before.
Frank Sinatra is amazing.
I have to go and see every movie he made in the fifties now.
I didnt know what it was about, but my father had seen it on the stage and thought it was great.
I had never really seen anything with him in it before.
I have watched it twice in the three days that I have had it so far.
He is completely believable in this role.
He has a voice like no one else.
I noticed that Marlon Brando was in it and thought that was interesting.
After this movie, I am hooked!

some great photos...and some not so great maps, copied from "mapquest"?
bruce and james history both deserve a better treatment...5 star material served as 2 star writing!
fantastic!
found quite a few grammatical mistakes...so o.k.
this is bruce lee material we have all been waiting for, james yimm lee, jesse glover, wally jay, etc.
poor publishing from a company that usually puts out quality books.
the early years!
get a real writer and a proofreader too!
the authors are poor storytellers.
the book reads like a danielle steel movie-of-the-week potboiler...boring.
there's great stuff here...too bad it reads like a "junior scholastic" teen book!
fantastic material, horrible presentation.
the early bruce, and a look back at how he developed.
maybe they will make-up for it with volume 2.
this is a book that has been needed for a long time now.
like a 5-star meal on a paper plate.

It blows In Love and Death outta the water!
Anyone who likes ILAD more than this, has no idea what they're talking about.
Pieces Mended - 8/10PS---Anyone who recommends Finch's "Say Hello to Sunshine" (the other guy below me), should never talk.
Buried Myself Alive - 9/107.
On My Own - 8/1012.
Bulimic - 7/104.
Noises and Kisses - 6/1011.
That album blows--but "What It Is to Burn" is an excellent album
This is another one of my favorite albums.
The Taste of Ink - 6/103.
And since the other guy did it, and i have some time, i'll rate the songs1.
A Box Full of Sharp Objects - 6/108.
Greener With the Scenery - 6/1010.
Poetic Tragedy - 7/106.
Blue and Yellow - 9/109.
Say Days Ago - 5/105.
Maybe Memories - 7/102.

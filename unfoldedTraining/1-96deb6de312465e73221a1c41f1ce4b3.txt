That weren't pluged into the 50 cents Matrix that spread across the land.
This 50 album is garbage.
Everyone's like " ....wh...where am I ?
...Now , the spell seems 2 be wearing off.
I feel like the kid in Sixth Sense.
Its funny 2 me though.
It was like everyone was brainwashed into worshiping 50 but me !
What happened ?!
U might think its immature of me 2 sit here and gloat "I toldja so" but I don't care.
When 50 first came out, I was could see {lame artist}.
WRONG.
Always has been, u just couldn't see that.
This review is for THEM.
50's garbage.
Join me in my joy, in watching these pretentious, wannabe, followers wallow over their dissapointment.
Theres others like me out there.
But no one else saw it.

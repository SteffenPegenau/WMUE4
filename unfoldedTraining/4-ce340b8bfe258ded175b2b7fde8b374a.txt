I have not yet put on any videos on it as I am not sure how to do it.
It says when I have the Sansa connected, I have the pictures.
I would recommend this because of the price and the capabilities of it.
Just remember to write your username and password somewher safe:).
I got this MP3 for my birthday and am impressed.
But I cannot sych the songs I have on my Playlists from Windows Media Player 11 unless they are from a CD.
I had a username and forgot it with my password.
Also transporting pictures is also hard.
Ripping and then synching CD's is easy.
One other minus is that the earphones sometimes become uncomfortable and fall off.
First, the Rhapsody is an ordeal.
I could email them to get my new username and password but I didn't get it.
There are some flaws in it though.
I tried this multiple times.
Good things about it is that the FM Radio is good but sometimes has bad reception.

I have been watching this CD player on Amazon.com for several months.
Nothing else matters.
However, when I get the earphone in, I heard some background noise.
Nothing looked wrong.
I changed some CD, it is still there.
I have to return it.
It is packed with tons of features.
Finally I took the plunge.
I have to go back to my 10 year old Sony Diskman!
I couldn't hear it for more than a minute.
I lowered the volume.
I was very excited when I received the package.
For me, it missed the very basic function of a CD player.
I still hear the noise.
I saw a lot of rev reviews here.
Sorry.

This review is for SmartBookWorms' Kindle edition of Kidnapped: B003RWS6FOParagraph formatting mostly good, although the dedication is all centred.
Proper dashes.
Hyperlinked table of contents in the text.
No maps.
That only finds a few of the many editions.
Preface and dedication.No real advantage over the free version.
Original footnotes in-line in the text.
Straight quotes, CAPS instead of smallcaps.
And also look for my review "Kindle Edition Choice is critical" for a review of all the available editions as of August 2010.
Search for "Kidnapped Stevenson" (without the quotes) to find the 25 or so editions available.
No Table of Contents link the in menu.
There are better editions available.
If you're looking for a Kindle edition of Kidnapped, don't just search for "Kidnapped".

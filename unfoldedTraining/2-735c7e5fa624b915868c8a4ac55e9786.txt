They were having a sale & I got it for under $11.
Well worth it.
But it is NOT worth the price it is listed for on here.
I think you'll be happy!
I am trying to find another one for my nephew who has not let it out of his hands since he arrived today.
And anybody who shops at Kohl's knows their toys are way overpriced there to begin with.
Save your money & go get a garbage truck 5x the size from toys r us or walmart.
Not at all worth nearly $30.
The new ebay.
Let me start by saying this is a really cute toy.
I'm not sure what is with Amazon sellers lately, but they are becoming ridiculously overpriced.
I got this truck at Kohl's where the original price was $15.99.
It makes real sounds & has a little piece of "garbage" that you dump in the truck.
My son loves it though & it is well worth the price I spent on it.
That being said, the garbage was lost the 1st night, the noises are obnoxious, it is pretty small & is plastic.
If you can find this between $10-$15, go for it.

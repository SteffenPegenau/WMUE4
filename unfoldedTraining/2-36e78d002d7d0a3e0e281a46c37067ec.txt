And give me a woman with too much backbone to take it.I won't even get into the "Prince Charming marries the maid" aspect of the 1900 romance.On the plus side, there is a brave attempt at gender bending in the reincarnation aspect.
Major turn off.
This was my first Nora Roberts.
I don't want rape scenes in romance novels, even when they aren't committed by the hero.
Give me a man who is too mature, and has too much integrity, to treat women like sex toys.
Language.
Rape scene: The story begins with a rape scene.
Bad language doesn't phase me, but I'm not looking for it in a romance novel.3.
(Yes, there are plenty of men like that.)
However, for me it interfered with the romantic mood.It's back to British Chick Lit for me.
Here are some reasons I'm sorry I picked it up:1.
The hero and his buddy spend an evening hitting the strip clubs.
I gave it a try because the "haunted New Orleans" aspect sounded fascinating.
Strip club.
With romance like this, who needs real life??2.

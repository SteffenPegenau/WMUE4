They would fall once they got right side up.Those are just SOME of the reasons I don't like bratz.
should I buy them?"
I think that bratz dolls are UGLY!
When they put on their make-up they probably have to use a whole stick of lipstick every time they put it on.3) They don't have a nose.
They probably can't breathe through their nose so they probably have to open their mouth and breathe out of that.
maybe they were born with one, but they had plastic surgeries to get it off just like Michael Jackson.4) Their head is huge!
Do you know why?1) They have huge feet that come off.
When they go shoe shopping, they're probably like "Oh my gosh, Jade!
I used to LOVE them, but not anymore because I got a reality check and noticed that Bratz are snotty.
Ewwww!2) They have huge lips.
Who knows?
They're shoes are their feet.
That's literally what they have to do, because they have no feet.
They wouldn't even be able to walk because their head is too heavy.
Look at these feet!

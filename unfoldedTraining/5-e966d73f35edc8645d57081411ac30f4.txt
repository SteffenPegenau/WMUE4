I've seen reviews that are less than favorable.
To them I would say: "you're looking for too much meaning".
15 years ago?
Lost my hardbound copy by lending it out.
I read this when it first came out - what?
So I was 25.
Terrific book.
Entertaining and thought provoking.
Read it.
I recommended The Truth Machine to a friend just a few weeks ago and just learned that it will be going to the big screen via Lion's Gate.
I think it will translate well.
I imagine it is well travelled by now - at least I sure hope so.
Don't over analyze it or pick it apart.
Just enjoy.
Wow!

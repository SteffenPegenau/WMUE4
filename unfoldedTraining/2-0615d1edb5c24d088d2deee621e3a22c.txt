I haven't been a fan of any of the DC or Marvel animated films.
Stories are too short and the first handful move slowly, it barely features Batman (from his point of view at least) enough, it is a Batman film afterall, the look of Batman in some of the designs is pretty blah.
Skip this dvd.
Its Batman after all.
the characters and story are not fleshed out at all.
I had, however, high hopes for Gotham Knights.
I'm not a big fan of Japanimation but was looking forward to the different visionaries taking on the project.
The animation is too flat or too much the same.
Go see The Dark Knight!
The fight scenes are non-existent.
The last episode with Deadshot was good, however way too short.
The result was less than stellar.
How does this film fit into the Nolan-verse of Batman?
I say with sadness of course...
Very disappointed overall.

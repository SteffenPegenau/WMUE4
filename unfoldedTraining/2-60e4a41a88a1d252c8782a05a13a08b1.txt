NO!
And are there people who read it and enjoy it?
I just couldn't go on.
In the goal of becoming less of an intellectual lightweight I tackled this book.
If I'd suffered through the whole thing, then I'd have the moral authority to give it 1 star.
I doubt it.
Did I quit?
No, I can't believe that.
I can belive that some people say that they've read it and liked it to show off.
Grueling page after page.
But no one could really read this book, much less like it.I give it 2 stars because I didn't suffer enough to give it 1 star.
It starts out slow, then stays slow.
I mean really read it?
Has anybody really read this book.
I was tempted to quit, yet I pressed on!
I was determined, I gritted my teeth and persisted.But somewhere around page 150 the book broke me!

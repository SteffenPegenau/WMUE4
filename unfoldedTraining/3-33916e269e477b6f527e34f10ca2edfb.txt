But don't worry!
If you're looking for ska, buy Turn the Radio Off.
I'm not going to say they sold out, because people that say things like that are stupid and pigheaded.
Aaron the singer, is in a new band with a bunch of guys from Jeffery's Fan Club, and it's GOOD SKA!
It's pop with horns spliced in.
In fact, this CD SOUNDS like Borders and Boundaries.
One thing I do have to give RBF props for is their vocal harmonies.
They've done exactly what LTJ did with Borders and Boundaries.
That's an excellent CD.
Check it out!
*sigh* If only it was ska.
The band is called Forces Of Evil and it's pretty funny cause they all have names like "Aaron EVIL" but it's really good ska music.
There IS hope!
But this CD is NOT ska.
Scott is doing an AMAZING job with the backup vocals and Aaron's voice sounds better now.

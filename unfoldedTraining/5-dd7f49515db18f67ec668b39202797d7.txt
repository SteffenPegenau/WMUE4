I love it!!
This is a surprisingly tough workout.
The time factor is also awesome.
Mine were so sore the next day - in a fantastic way!
:)
I love having the flexibility to do one or both depending on how much time I have.
Her energy is definitely contagious!
She's so positive and INCREDIBLY strong.
Kristin is one of my favorite instructors.
Her Power Yoga dvd is also fantastic.
I have a ton of workout dvds - and this is by far one of the best I own!
NICE JOB KRISTIN!!
I really hope Acacia produces more like this one.
Kristin really gets your heartrate going and the pilates moves completely target your abs.
I think there are a lot of of us who enjoy pilates/yoga, but want to have cardio incorporated as well.

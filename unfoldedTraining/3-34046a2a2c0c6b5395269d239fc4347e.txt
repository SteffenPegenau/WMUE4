So I decided, well since I got the blu-ray, let me get the blu-ray version of one of my all time favorite trilogies!
If you have the DVD version, dont waist your money to get the blu-ray.
So I site back, get ready to experience my godfather flick in Blu-Ray, hit play and......WOW!
Popped it in and the title menu was pretty grainey.
I loved it!
STILL GRAINEY!!
When I went from VHS to DVD, there was a HUGE difference in picture and sound quality.
I owned all 3 on VHS and DVD.
There is not much of a change in picture quality.
Dont get me wrong.
So that was disappointing but I figure, just the title, no big deal.
So really I was not sure why I just got rid of the DVD version to get the Blu-ray version!?
Heck it is the The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration set, so the picture has to be UNREAL.
But it is still the Godfather, I love the flick and can never get enough.
I love the godfather!

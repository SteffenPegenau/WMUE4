Scott if you read this I hope you feel REALLY BAD!!!
Plus some people kind of dislike Scott (the bassist) cause he was at Krock insteat of Comic-Con with the cast of Teen Titans.
For letting innocent kids DOWWWN!!
12 years together and only 3 albums.
Because he had to go off and perform with his F-IN band!!!!!!!
GET THE #%^K OVER IT!!
If that were another band like...
They are getting NO WHERE fast!
I'm very sorry I just had to get that off my chest.
I think they SHOULD break up!!
Thanks for letting us down!!!
I would have given this a 5.
You are way to OBSESSED with BHC!!
I hope when he was performing at Krock I hope he felt REALLYYYYY REEEALLYY BAAADDD!!!
But they just HAAAD to put that CRAP band Boy Hits Car!!
Some people were REALLY bummed!!
You aren't going ANYWHERE.
The Stones they would have 7 albums instead of 3!!
They thought he WOULD be there.They waited ALLLL year for that and had there dreams CRUSHED into tiny pieces!!
That is sooo pathetic.

By backing off the output ("volume" knob) from the guitar, you can get some good rock tones, at a variety of distortion levels.
It's a good pedal, but it does require a little finesse.
If you turn everything up to "11," it sounds pretty bad--harsh and abrasive.
A little edgier?
Want it a little grungier?
I wanted some creamy overdrive and increased sustain for my Strat.
Makes some very sweet sounds.
It's too grungy for chord work.
Turn up the tone control, to increase the treble.
Use the volume knob to control your levels into your amp or mixer.
But one caveat: This is pretty much for lead guitar, only.
I'm running the pedal as a DI box, straight into the mixer, with some outboard compression from a rack mounted unit.
Simple.
Turn up the distortion.
Very easy for recording.
I bought this pedal for use in my project studio.
Just don't max out the guitar output going into the unit, and you'll have tons of tonal colors to play with.

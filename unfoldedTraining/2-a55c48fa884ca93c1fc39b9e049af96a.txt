Worked fine for 6 months, then stopped working.
Took it apart and saw a piece of white plastic inside.
My daughter likes this dryer.
I bought another unit from Amazon.
Not the GFCI, not the switch.
I installed the first one 7 months ago.
No easy work around.
The heating coil was still intact.
Will see how long this second one last.
The new one made clicking noise when I was installing it.
It was not broken off from the dryer itself.
It is not likely I'll bought the third one.
Took it apart and used my multimeter to see whether I could find out where was the problem.
Seem to be a random piece included as "bonus for returning customer".
Both the fan and heating coil were not operational.

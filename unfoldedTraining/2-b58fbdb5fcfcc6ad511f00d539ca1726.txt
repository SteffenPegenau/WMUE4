Possibly the others out there are just as bad.
They're inadequate clues at best.
I fought with this thing for several hours and two calls to customer service.
Do it backwards and you lose your connection.
Both useless, by the way.
The encryption process is cruel.
No mention of the order in the directions.
I also set up a d-link wireless printer adaptor.
Having never done encryption I didn't realize that I supply the encryption code.
Either I'm stupid or the reviewers who found this thing easy to set up are just lucky.
Now that I've got it set up, it generally works fine.
You have to do it in the proper order - I believe the base computer you're using for set up and then the your wireless computer.
Equally frustrating and directions better but left out one very important fact.
Learned by trial and error.
The instructions are beyond horrible.
Finally figured that out.
No instructions for the event you just want to set up your wireless computer without a base 'setup' computer.

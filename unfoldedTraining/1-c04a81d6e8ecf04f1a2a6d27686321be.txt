I just had to stop using the shower unit altogether.
I thought it would be a good tub to have because of the shower unit.
When I sat it up higher my daughter slides down and her legs become too long for her to sit comfortably.
The button is hard to press and the water does not come out very good.
It was too much trouble just to give the baby a simple bath.
The instructions say that if the shower unit stops working then you have to place the sprayer below the unit and it will start back working.
This in fact was not the case.
I was wrong.
Now instead of the shower unit I use a cup to rinse her off.
When I opened it up and started using it I quickly learned that the shower does not work.
The unit never did start back working.
This tub was given to me as a gift.
The sling sits too low during the infant stage.
I am glad that I did not put any money into it and I wish I had read the review on this tub before placing it on my registry.
Now I just use the tup without the shower.

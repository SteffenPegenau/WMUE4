Well worthreading even if you disagree.
I belong to the Gelukpa Order so Ishould be giving this book one star.
So much for the Gelukpa Order ofTibetan Buddhism.
).The author gives the outlandish belief that the rules of thevinaya (monastic order) were simply created so that they couldget along with one another!
But I recommend it foreveryone.
The author also refersto having moral precepts as being "drag factors".
And had nothing to do withcause-and-effect karma!
Nevertheless, his chapter on the useof alcohol to hasten enlightenment and his account of a lamastopping rain in his prescence are incredible!
He willalso stop you from using an alarm clock with a button thatdelays your awake by ten minutes!
Meditation techniques aregood, but a little too advanced.
I read it twicebefore I sold it (and you're not supposed to sell dharma books!
Priceless information contained inside.
This book was written by an iconoclastic lama.
They dragdown altruistic intent.
Just read it.

I haven't seen such a clear picture before, not even the higher resolution and more expensive LCD TVs.
Amazing picture quality!!!!
Haven't found any weaknesses so far.
I think it would be a great one.
When I used the composite video cables, I don't like the quality very much though still impressive.
I don't agree with the previous reviewer: the reviewer says the Samsung is much better than Aquos--in fact, I think they are about the same; but it is true that Aquos' speakers are a little weak and unclear.
No front video or audio jacks.
Everything is so easy to use.
So I ordered the monster COMPONENT VIDEO CABLE FROM AMAZON and plugged it to watch a DVD--JET LI's HERO---WOW WOW WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
Aquos was once my favorite.
Totally amazing.
No panel cover.
But for picture, about the same.
Seriously, the TV picture is good though probably not as crytal as a tube TV but for movies, absolutely better.
I also like the Sharp Aquos B4U.

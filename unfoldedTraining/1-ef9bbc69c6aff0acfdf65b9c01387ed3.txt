I'll order those next time.. they are not too salty, just the right amount of crunch, and taste great.
He's going to try breaking them up (I assume with a hammer) and put them in his next batch of chili.
I DO NOT recommend these bars.
I worried about cracking my teeth on them.
They have 5 or 6 flavors and I like them all.
I love Jalapeno, and I love cheese.. what could go wrong?
If I could have given them zero stars, I would have.I thought these would be great..
He didn't like these either.
I was skeptical, but they are GREAT!
They are extremely hard to bite into.
I wish him good luck.
Before you read this, I highly recommend Just the Cheese's mini rounds in the same flavor.
They taste like jalapeno flavored salt blocks.I gave them to a friend of mine who eats anything and everything (Mikey Jr!).
I suggested that he use them for repelling pests in his garden.I wrote the company, and they sent me some samples of the mini rounds.
These bars could and did!

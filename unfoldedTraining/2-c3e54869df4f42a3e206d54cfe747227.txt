I would also like to know what the plastic insert is made of.
The threaded insert is chrome plated brass.
There are food grade and non-food grade plastics.BE SURE TO WASH IT BEFORE YOU USE IT.
It serves it's job very well.
The outer tube is stainless.
The cap is chrome plated brass.
I am still happy to have it all the same.
Being that they lied about the brass I doubt if the stainless truly is food grade.
This is not 100% stainless.
The cap still had cutting oil in it.This tube holds exactly 8 round tooth picks.
Despite the false advertising and lousy chrome plating it does the job very well.
Plenty if you ask me.This tube is very sturdy and very well constructed.
The inner tube is plastic.
It is thin and flakes off with little effort.
The chrome plating was very poorly done, as it came off within two days of it being in my pocket.

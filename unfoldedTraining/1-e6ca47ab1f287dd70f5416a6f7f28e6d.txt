I can live that.
I ordered this one and was quite happy with the fast shipping.
The third fly literally crawled through the mesh and out the other side.
The red light would come on, but no discharge.
Awesome.
Straight into the trash.
Glad it was fairly inexpensive.
Red light, no discharge.
Then nothing.
POW.
Right out of the box I had to tape the battery door shut.
I tried another set of batteries.
Saw a co-worker using one of a similar design.
Just held it up near the window and they flew against it.
No burnt areas.
I put in fresh batteries and killed two flies immediately.
You could hear the capacitor emit a high pitched whine when it charged up as you pressed the button.
Twice.
I took the unit apart and all the soldering appeared to be intact.

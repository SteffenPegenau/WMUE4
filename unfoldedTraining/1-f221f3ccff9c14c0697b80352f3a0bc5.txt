As many others have stated the controls are terrible.
I would think any game in production for longer than a year would be, at the very least, mediocre.
That is my fault.
Not very good, I reply.
WRONG.
In the end this game was a waste of time.
This game is a let down.
They are not impressive.
Story you ask?
That might be biased on my part because, I read reviews that compared them to real life.
The sound track.
If I was the CEO of EA, I would work on hiring a full time wizard to give people the time they wasted back.
People "give it up" for the grafix.
I was waiting for the next installment for a long time, (over a year).
I actually controled the game better with a banana peel, and one of those paper fortune tellers.
This game doesn't make it past unsatisfactory, not by a long shot.
I'll leave it at that.
I won't agree.

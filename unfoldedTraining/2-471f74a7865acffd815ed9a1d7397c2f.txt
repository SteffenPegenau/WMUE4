No real pain here, no heartbreak.
The camera-work is so beautiful, you feel he has a great film in him.
Shame.
No deleted scenes, no interviews, nothing.
When it finally came, it was more of a: "And now, the weather" kind of thing.
And what about that ending?My DVD doesn't give any clues, as the extras are spare.
The trailer, a short by Tag Purvis, scene access and filmographies.

Dan Montgomery and Walter Goggins.
Just people shambling about, doing their business.It's a real pity, because the male actors are sooo attractive.
I would like to see more of Tag Purvis, though.
Good looking guys.
Contrary to the picture on the cover, the main story concerns a family secret.

Red dirt features some wonderful scenery and great camera-work, but...the plot is dire!

First, I should explain that I keep kosher.
You can put them in the dishwasher.

They last a long time.
They seal well.
What this means in practicality is that I use blue-lidded storage containers for dairy foods and red-lidded ones for meat foods.I like these containers because: 1.
These Deep Dish containers can be used to store meals made ahead of time, large leftovers or food transportation.
You can use GladWare containers of different sizes to store ingredients for a dish one or two days before mixing/combining and cooking.Just a note: I didn't list these reasons in any order, I just wrote them as they popped into my head.
You can also store non-food items in them, such as pencils, makeup, toys, etc.
You can label what is inside on the tops and sides of the containers.
You can freeze food in them easily.

One has to pull down the inside piece of the watch clasp toward your wrist and lift up the clasp door and then it will pop open.
Took it to Kay Jewelers and they sized it for me at no charge.
The instruction manual is generic for all Invicta watches and was not very helpful for the operation of the safety clasp on the band.
Beautiful watch color combinations of gold on blue face.
Swiss movement.
Kay also has a lifetime battery replacement so don't worry about changing the battery, just take it to them.
Enjoy this watch when it comes available again.
Looks like a Rolex.
Safety clasp.
Heavy and well made.
Keeps great time.
Got mine for $117.
Thank you Kay Jewelers!
I read the reviews about the batteries and inquired about this.
will get many compliments.

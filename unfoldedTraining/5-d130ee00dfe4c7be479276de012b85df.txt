This is the best album Faith has put out!!
I really love "Like We Never Loved At All."
"Dearly Beloved" is one of the funniest songs I have ever heard.
Originally, isn't it?
To be honest, the first time I heard the live version of "Paris" I was not sold on it, but the album version is just beautiful.
Tim does a great job on the background vocals.
There is not a song on this album I dislike.
My username on there is FaithNTimRock.
Its just a great and relaxing song!!
I have been a fan since "Take Me As I Am" and I think Faith has outdone herself this time!!!!!!!
I love the rawness in Faith's voice.
I am such a fan of Faith's that I joined her i-squad as a way to support her.
"Wish For You" gives me chills.
Its emotional, and such a great song.
What can I say?

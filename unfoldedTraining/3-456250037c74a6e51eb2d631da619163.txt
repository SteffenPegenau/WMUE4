The film is very slow and drawn out, trying to make the small plot seem bigger.
Which is a huge pity, because the idea is very interesting.
Yet it never really does so.
There was so much room to develope and expand the idea.
The script is so poor.
There is nothing more.
There are some moments where real emotion is shown and it draws us in.
But the movie always seem to lose that connection.
But after seeing it I walked away thinking was that it.
Not all the characters were expanded like they could have been.This movie is good, but it could have been great.
A lower class boy genius and only one man that can really seem to help him.
Everyone kept telling me how great this film was and that I HAD to see it.
Robin Williams was brilliant, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had moments of brilliance.
It rarely sounds natural.
Affleck moreso.
A rent rather than buy.
The dialoge sounds written, it feels worked out.

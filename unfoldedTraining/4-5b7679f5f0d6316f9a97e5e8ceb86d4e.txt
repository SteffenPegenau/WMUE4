Ya its cool to see someone get blown up and fly through the air but thats not why you buy video games is it?
it runs smooth and it does work with windows 7 but the computer has to downgrade to make the game compatable to play.
But the rest of the game is awsome!
It was too short and too easy.
We have had it for a little while and it is a fantastic game!
Who buys a video game because of how realistic it is?
this game is very fun to play and i have spent some time playing this game and it is a great game.
I buy them cause i enjoy playing them and because they are unrealistic.
Some people reviews were talking about how realistic the game was.
I play alot of the skirmish matches (offline) but the campain is the only thing i didnt really like about the game.
Some said it wasnt.
Where else can you control a couple hundred people and take over a entire area?
Its a video game people!
This game is AWSOME!
Its not real life!

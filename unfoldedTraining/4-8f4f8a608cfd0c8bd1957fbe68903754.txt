The way Campion captures small details, like the way the protagonist would see them.
The garden outside her window.
In some ways, I like it more every time I see it.
There is a quiet beauty to the film.
The additions are what make this film.
Meg Ryan playing against type.
And I loved the ending.
Because I hated the book, I was curious to see how they would make it into a film.
I felt unresolved at the end of the book, and this ending made me happy.This movie is not for everyone.
There is a lot of gore, and violence, and sex, but I think it was done well.
But, I think attention was payed to the important things in the character's life.
Mark Ruffalo is wonderful in his role, not giving the end away.
The poetry in the subway.
Halfway through, I still wasn't impressed, but I waited.
I think it would have been horrible if it was completely true to the book.
Then I learned Jane Campion was directing, and was intrigued.

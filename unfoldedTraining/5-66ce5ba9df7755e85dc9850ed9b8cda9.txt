Agatha thought he was dead.
Agatha is suspected of murder.
Later Agatha pushes Jimmy into a ditch and he is found dead in the ditch.
Another good one by M C Beaton.
I guess we will have to read another book to find out.
You can just see the things as they happen.
Will Agatha and James ever get together again.
In this one Agatha is finally getting to marry James Lacey.
But, her first husband Jimmy Raisin shows up at the wedding.
Beaton can write so that the people and the village come to life in your mind.
Other people start ending up dead after talking to Agatha and James.
I have enjoyed all the Agatha Raisin books I have read.
She and James Lacey start their usual round of questions and callin on people to try to find the killer.
Am looking forward to the next one.
After another close call the killer is found.

Not typical sexploitation.

McDowell is ruthless.
This is the VHS "Dangerous Indiscretion."
I highly recommend this film.
I am reviewing Joan Severance's "Dangerous Indiscretion," also featuring devious Malcolm McDowell and C. Thomas Howell.
There are lots of ruthless scenes along with some moments of tender love.
Engaging plot, moves along, a few touching moments.
Severance's powerful hubby, evil McDowell finds evidence of the liasion & seeks to destroy Howell, beating Severance in the process.
This is an enjoyable above average film that keeps flowing.
Clever uses of photo tampering shown.
81 minutes.
Severance's acting rivals her beauty.
Short, moving, engaging thriller.Dr.
At same time he is trying to get zoning approval for a lakeside complex.
Howell's support lady is a doll.
A free spirit creative ad man, Howell sees Severance and after the predictable chase they couple.

IM not sure what to do with the wires.
Also the first thing it says in the instructions.
The remote is just sitting on my center console.
Also the way the wires come out of the top and the bottom of the remote you cant mount it.
I will waite to see what it looks like at night.
You really need to know what you are diong to install these.
The lights look cool from what i can see it is still daytime.
I just hooked up lights.
Im not sure if im going to keep these or not.
Not a well thought out product.
Reason it will look like crap!
Not very easy to install.
!
This product must be installed by a pro.
It needs to be improved!
They should tell you that!!
With the wires sticking out and it lookes like crap!
Maybe i can deal with the crappy looking wire if the lights are cool.

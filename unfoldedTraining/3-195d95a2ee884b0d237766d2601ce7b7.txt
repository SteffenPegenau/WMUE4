Jump2.
After listening to the album several times from beginning to end, I've formed mixed feelings about it.
This is one of Madonna's most unique albums.
Forbidden Love5.
Sorry4.
My favorites are--1.
And instead of hearing 12 separate tracks, it sounds like one long, drawn out song--sometimes creating overkill.
However the album has a few stand out numbers that make the record more enjoyable.
And this time she's introduced a new sound that we've never heard on previous Madonna records.
3 1/2 stars!
Let it Will BeIt's definitely unlike anything out in stores today, but the album tends to deliver too much of a good thing--which makes it a little unbearable at times.
The songs blend together after a while.
She's reinvented herself yet again.
Nevertheless, it's still worth a listen.
It sounds like a mix of 70's disco and techno/trance.
Get Together3.

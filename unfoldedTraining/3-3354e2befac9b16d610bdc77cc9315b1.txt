It's an iron.
But c'mon, a little better quality would be nice.
And if you find one that you really like, LET ME KNOW!
Hey, it was absolutely GREAT during those three years and we raved about it to everyone.
I mean, it's not a cheap iron.
My husband and I put this iron on our bridal registry 3 years ago and we ended up getting two of them.
We should have kept that 2nd one.
It's not like we traveled with it, dropped it, pulled at it and threw it down on the floor.
:-)
My Mom even ran out and got the same one after talking to us about how we loved ours.
You would think it would last more than three years???
I read another review for this iron from someone else that said the same thing.
You heat it up, you run it lightly over your clothes and turn it off.
Thanks!
Because now, only three years later it has shorted out!!!
Shop around first.

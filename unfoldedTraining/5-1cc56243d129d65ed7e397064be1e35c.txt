The sound is superb with the harmonies bursting forth through your speakers!
I was pleasantly surprised when I listened to it; many great songs that I had never heard!
The real interesting part of the anthology is disc 4, which contains mainly solo performances after the Mamas & the Papas broke up.
Of all my recent purchases, I can't put this set down!
!
You will be amazed at the clarity of the audio.
"The Mamas & the Papas Complete Anthology" is FANTASTIC!
It is a fantastic package, with lots of historical info & pics, but the sound is what is amazing!
YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!
Origninally, I was going to purchase their first album "If You Can Believe Your Eyes & Ears" but opted for this complete anthology set instead.
Why there are no plans to release this set in the U.S. is unfathomable to me.
Boy was I surprised!
BUY THIS NOW!
I can not recommend this set enough!
You do not need to buy any other Mamas & Papas disc if you purchase this, as it contains EVERYTHING!

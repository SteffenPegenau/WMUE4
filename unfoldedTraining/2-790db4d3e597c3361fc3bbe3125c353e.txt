I want to hear music when I buy cds!
Track 11 was just dumb sound effects.Maybe someday they'll release a greatest hits cd with their best songs.
%75 intro/sound effects.
Pros: When the songs started rockin they were as good as Tool has ever been.
track 10 came and I was thinking, "Okay 2 more songs to change my epinion."
You'd think that they could've wrote more than 6 or 7 actual songs in 5 years.
Some of the songs were just intros that never built to the song.
Then you won't have to waste money on a cd that is half sound effects that they thought were cool.
Track 10 was great.
There was a stupid song that was just tribal voices that never turned into anything.
Heavy and caotic.
Just tracks where the instruments played the same thing over and over with voices in the background.
It's what you expect from Tool.
Followed by a track of sound effects.
Very musical.Cons: %25 hard rock.
You know how Tool has some long intros before the song gets going?

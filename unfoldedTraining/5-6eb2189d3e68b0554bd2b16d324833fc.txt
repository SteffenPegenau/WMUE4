All the songs are good on this album.
They have a little of everything.
Having 2 singers is a very cool thing in any rock band.
Not that I don't like to hear cusswords, but sometimes it just gets old.The only negative thing about the album is that it's only about 38 minutes long.
Linkin Park is a great band.
I can't wait till their next CD.
Linkin Park is not just another band.
Number 11 is even good, and it's not even a real song.
They sing about everyday things.
It sounds like a song that should be from some incredible movie.
These guys are for real.
They mix their singing very well.
It's finally good to see a band come out that doesn't have a parental advisory sticker on it.
I played it so many times but I haven't gotten sick of it yet.
They rap sometimes.
Then all of a sudden they start to sing.
Not the crap Limp Bizquit sings about.

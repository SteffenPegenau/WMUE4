I was greatly mistaken.
Any parts you don't like will grow on you.
At the time of it's release, before I heard it, I thought they were just another band released to sell off the uprising of rock.
Ok, this CD was released in 1999.
Click above and listen to the samples.
The rest of the trip was Fono and only Fono.My advice is this.
If any little part sounds good, buy the CD.
The two sound nothing alike for those wondering.
This one, and "40 Acres," by Caedmon's Call.
I can honestly say that I was listening to two CD's the whole time.
The question I'm left asking is, Fono, where are you?
When I first got this CD, I was headed back home on a five hour roadtrip.
That's four years ago.
To me, this album is best described as "catchy."
Anyway, I listened only to those two, and on that trip I listened to the Caedmon's Call CD once through.
!This CD is truely awesome.

It didn't feel so much like a romance.
I don't believe that she killed that man!
I've noticed that a lot with these stories though.
I guess if I wanted to read that genre I would have read a book like that.I really don't like it when one of the characters is basically sentenced to death and there isn't a lot to do about it.
Not sure of the laws back then, but come on .
David did betray her though,but I guess all that is okay since he was doing if for the greater good, right???
.
Did David ever acknowledge that?
So I read this book because it was a second chance story.
However, I felt that the romance aspect got lost in the "mystery story".
.
?
she brought him to the authorities attention!!!
She was a young child when she was "forced" to do some of the things that she had to do.
There is so much else going on rather than focusing on the relationship I feel like I've been diverted into the spy/mystery/murder world.

buy it, you'll love it!
i'm a teacher and between teaching and practicing, i'm on my mat several times a day, 7 days a week.
i've turned 2 other yogis onto the prolite mat.
so how eco-friendly is it to keep buying mats that don't hold up to major wear and tear?
i've had many teachers tell me about manduka and i finally decided to try it.
i'm hooked!
i give it 2 thumbs up, and if i had more thumbs, i'd give more thumbs up.
but, i'm looking to get a black pro for home, or maybe just another prolite.
i would have bought the black pro mat, but because i'm at so many different locations, i opted for the lighter weight.
so far, there's no show of use.
i'm eco concious and the biodegradable mats biodegrade as i use them.
i've tried various mats hoping to find the perfect one.
why not?
i go through mats like kleenex because they just don't hold up for me.
it's the strongest and sturdiest mat i've ever used and it enhances my practice because i feel the strong support.

You will follow character's for chapters on end only to have them die at a moments notice.
I kid you not.
It's all a bit tedious and makes for one frustrating read.
Some characters are well developed and interesting.
Or worse, the book ends before the author returns to the character or storyline.
Like I wrote previously, I'm truly torn!
Now I find myself torn, do I read on or cut my losses?
It is merely a long setup for the next book and likely the one after that.
As a stand alone read, however, it is mightily disappointing.
And the author spends endless pages describing past histories of so and so this and so and so that.
All that said, it has it upside too.
I'm leaning towards the latter as there is also a lack of reward to the reader throughout.
There is no completion of any of the main story lines.
Amazingly, after 720 pages, this is not a complete book!
Generally well written.
And parts of it are engaging.

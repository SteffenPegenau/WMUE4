This model EO1200B is from Delonghi newest line of toaster oven.
Other delonghi oven racks have 2 positions.
Inside oven there are 2 positions/slots to put rack but bottom rack slot is too low to coils & will burn food.
I think Delonghi cut corners on their NEW LINE of toaster ovens to compete with other manufactures prices!
It looks & is made very cheap.
I used my mother's rmodel EO1200B oven and was very disappointed.
Interior oven walls are made of aluminum not durastone enamel like other delonghi ovens.
Delonghi ovens are typically more expensive than other manufacturer but worth the money.
!
Aluminum inside oven impossible to clean.
The wire rack can only be used one way.
Pizza will fit in oven only if pizza is made "perfectly" to align with shape of back wall.
Do not recommend this oven.
Buy an older Delonghi ovens which are made much better.
I have owned many Delonghi Toaster ovens oven years.Delonghi ovens are generally made well & durable for years.

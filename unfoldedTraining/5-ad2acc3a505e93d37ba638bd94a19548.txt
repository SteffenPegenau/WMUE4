My daughter fell in love with it.
It supported her head and her back with ease.
I researched for a bouncer that would be best for preemies.
We brought her home weighing in at 4lbs 5oz and on a heart monitor and oxygen.
She is now 10lbs and still loves the bouncer.
The Baby Papasan came up the winner.
She was a 26 weeker weighing in at 1 pound 15oz.
She loves the vibration ( she has colic ) and it does shut off after 15 minutes.
!
That is the only thing that could be improved.
We were concerned about getting her a regular bouncer because there was no support.
We also had to make sure she would be comfortable with her heart monitor on.
I had my daughter back in July, 14 weeks early... She wasn't due til October!
I would definately recommend this for preemies!!
It supported her in everyway and for her being so small that was the selling point.

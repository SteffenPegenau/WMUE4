I'm so annoyed.
This pill did nothing.
In fact, after a week of taking these things I gained weight!!
In fact, I felt bloated and hungrier for more crap---like chips and chocolate.
I finally noticed that the people that gave the best reviews were pushers of the product when I clicked on their other reviews.
I would give it 0 stars, but there is no zero!
After I tried the product for a few days, I went back online to see if I was taking it properly and to read the advice others would suggest.
!
LIES ALL LIES!!
I exercised for an hour 5 times a week doing elliptical, just like before I took the pills.
The product did nothing for me.
I believed the damn reviewers on here.
Now I'm all bloated and have to wear my fat pants thanks to this product.
I usually don't have cravings that strong.
This product sucked.
What the heck??

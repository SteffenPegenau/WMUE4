They should have all been white for all I could hear.
They get one star for the cover.
They had so much to work with and put together so little.
All I can say is shame.
Maybe they were looking for more coke money...they sound spun(and deaf.)
This album is not funky nor is it soulful.
TERRIBLE HACKING HERE.
Lame.
It is a travesty.
I love the Beatles, this is a disgrace to both r&b and the band.
HACKFEST.
HACKFEST.
I listen to all jazz and funk...this album is rancid.
Unhip.
Talk about an over rated hackfest.
If you like 70s elevator music, you'll love this.

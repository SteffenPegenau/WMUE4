I bought this product due to the appeal that it was basically as bare boned as you could get in terms of taking protein.
This stuff tastes TERRIBLE.
I can drink anything as I usually just mix my protein with water and chug it.
Let me tell you I love my casein in comparison to this stuff.
This stuff does mix very well, if there was one pro.
No unnecessary ingredients, etc.
I've tried it with milk and gatorade (yes I even went to gatorade to mask the taste).
I would not buy again and would advise you to stay away, or maybe try a flavored option.
Now that I have to mix it with all sorts of other stuff to bear it, I have defeated the sole purpose of me buying it in the first place.
Still tastes awful mixed with both.
Flavorless?
My judgment told me not to believe and I was duped.
I've never complained about taste, until now.
Water is the worst.
I laugh when people tell me they hate the taste of casein.

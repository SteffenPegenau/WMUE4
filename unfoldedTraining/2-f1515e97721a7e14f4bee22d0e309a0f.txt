Are they supposed to be painfully slow?
Did I get a bad one?
Well, quiet is but I have yet to get the gun to melt embossing powder!
This one, wouldn't thaw out a Margarita in Mexico.
My other gun did it in seconds.
Heck my cheap $15 backup lasted 13 years, at times running for hours to thaw out pipe!
I watched videos, read some reviews and didn't think it would be bad.My backup gun burned out (it's used to many things besides papercrafts) and I wanted to make sure I had a backup.
I'm not kidding when I say I sat there for 2 minutes and it didn't melt any powder!
I will be contacting the company about it.
Quiet is good right?
A waste of money in my mind.
My recommendation, don't buy this one.
It works great if you just want to dry your paper but to use to emboss I haven't been able to get it to work.
I pull out my Milwaukee (SU) to get the job done.
I timed it.

He has used thisbasic premise several times now and it is getting old.
It had many of the same elements with a better story line...END
It was about the only original thing in this story.
What about a German Shepard, even a poodle?
I knew what his characters were going to be doing pretty early on.
For a really good book by Mr Koontz, see Strangers.
How come though it seems in half of his books they are always the smartest?
I really do.
Maybe even another animal?
Ok Mr Koontz, I get the idea, you like retrievers!
I enjoy dogs.
Mr Koontz needs to think of a new story.
Thought the whole reason why the doctor chose that family as about the stupidest reason ever.
I did like the Skeet character.
Also, why do they always have to be retrievers?
If he uses theword "fugue" in one more story I might never buy another book of his again.

However, using AA batteries and having a viewfinder does add to its size.But so far, I am very pleased.
I purchased this Canon camera to replace another returned camera.
I felt like I was going to break the door off trying to open the compartment.
The continuous shutter is really cool.
The benefit of having a viewfinder is priceless.The downsides of the camera are not enough to return it.
Although I did find a couple favorite settings.
The 570IS is so full of features, I may never use all of them.
Not available on every format.
3) So far, I can only get the date stamp on a certain view.
2) The battery/disk compartment can be cumbersome.
1) It does eat batteries.
Can't wait to use it for sports shots!
4) It is bigger and bulkier than some of the other cameras.
The AUTO setting works well, even in low light.
The manual wasn't helpful in explaining the limitation.
I will now invest in rechargeable batteries.

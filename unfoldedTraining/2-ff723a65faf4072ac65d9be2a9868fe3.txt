Thi is not you at all.
I liked the beginning.
Instead, all I got was this.
A poor effort to say the least.
Ok the bad guy didnt go through his assignment.
OK the other characters helped out but why?
What a shame.
Why did you write this supposed good book?
What happened Higgins?
OK the President did everything he had to.
I didnt understand much of this outing at all.
I liked everything else you wrote.
The middle loses the intensity of all of the other books before this mess.
I was hoping fior a great book.
This is not a good effort by Higgins.

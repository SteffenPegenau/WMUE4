Buy a high end unit that is made to last.
Really, really wish I had saved the 27 bucks.
Why make an adapter out of plastic?
When the filter itself is full of water the weight torques on the adapter causing failure.
Leaks from the threads, leaks from the collar where the unit attaches to the adapter.
This one was similar, so I tried it.
carafe.My advice: don't bother with these lower end on-faucet units.
After about two weeks I started having leaks.
OR just buy a carafe and make do...
It WILL fail, not if but when.
I guess I'll be going the way of many others and buying (a Britta!)
They are built to fail and will not last.
Was very happy with it.
I owned a previous Britta on-faucet filter that lasted longer than they made the filters for it!
Cheap plastic adapter was the main problem.

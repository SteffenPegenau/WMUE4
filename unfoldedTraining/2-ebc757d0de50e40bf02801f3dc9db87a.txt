We never know.
New editor?
I got hooked on the berserker series after reading "Berserker Base", and went to my local half price bookstore and bought every book in the series I could find.
Mr. Saberhagen repeats himself a lot, and his prose isn't very smooth in this novel for some odd reason.
Did it die?
This was the worst of the bunch; the others are pretty good.
He's done fine in the past, but this one was sloppy.
If this is your first Berserker book, don't give up on the series.
This book, Shiva in Steel, has proved to be the worst.
Is it hiding in our hero's ship as he makes his get away?
First, let me say that in general I like the way Fred Saberhagen writes, and his stories and plots are exceptional.
No editor?
The plot wasn't bad, but the execution was poor.
The hype over the big bad Shiva is never resolved!
This should have been a draft rather than the final product.

When this item arrived, I opened it, skeptically took everything out of the box.
It used to be a momentous task to peel all those apples.
So wonderful if you have any hand issues and find peeling apples difficult.
So easy, so complete.
My family loves all things apple,and in particular, apple pie.
It could be one of the best kitchen gadgets!
Talk about tired wrists!This peeler is so awesome.

My daughter in law and daughter were watching as I placed an apple on the peeler and began to turn,,,,wow!
Love it!
"Highly Recommended.
With arthritis, I was looking for something to help me with peeling apples.
I was actually surprised how easy it was to use.
The perfect apple peeler!
Easy to use and peeled the apple beautifully.
Did not move while peeling apple.
My apple pie takes at least 12 medium to large apples.
Sturdy and built well.
We all cheered the results!
It saves so much time, and it works exactly like demonstrated.

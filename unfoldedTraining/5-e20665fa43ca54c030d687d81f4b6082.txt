Plus every song is long.
I love this CD.
His voice is real scratchy and raw.
He may not have the best voice play the best instrument but what he puts on a recording strings a chord with the listener.
Thunder on the Mountain is a foot-stomping song.
This was the first Dylan I bought/listened to since his music of the 60's.
But lets face it....Dylan was never know as a great singer.
Each song is a story.
This CD reminds me of a group who is still hungry trying to make it big and does a knockout performance.
Dylan is like a Van Gogh of music.
His sound is completely different but I like it just as much.
I could see it being used for line dancing - not that I would know since I have never done that or seen it.
Every song is great.
he Levee's Gonna Break, Spirit on the Water, Rollin and Tumblin are all great.
It is how he "sees" the music that makes him great.
It is so different from not just his music but others as well.

I was sorely disappointed.
It was like torture eating this.
I had to force myself to finish it.
It has almost no flavor, but what flavor it does have lingers in your mouth and grosses you out.Who I'd recommend it to: 1.)
My enemies.
2.)
It tasted awful.
So I went ahead and ate it.
He tried it and he felt the same way.
I actually opened up the second and dared a coworker to try it because it was so bad.
So that was a turnoff, but I said hey I have never been one to let looks or smell hinder me from trying something new.
I bought two of these and I was excited to try one.
I opened it and was hit by the awful smell of... well a foot-like scent.
I like to try all different health food bars and when I saw one that combined my two favorite things together (chocolate and hazelnuts) I said, "oooh I have to try".
People that like to give friends that lose bets something awful to eat.

Let that recall be a numbing moment in the read.
Was her beauty the driving force?
Intersting tho, that it included WW2.
Hannibal is now a sex symbol, someone women should find ultimately attractive, ultimatley seductive?
Wonderful read.
Pump me full of drugs before I watch my nemesis eaten.
What if Clarice was no beauty?
But where else could Clarice and Hannible go but together into the night?
I feel almost short-sheeted by this easy end.
Whatever his motivation, he did eat the face of an innocent nurse.
What is she was common?
That's my review.
Feel let down that we must know what truly moved Lecter to his deadly deeds.
Drugs or not I do not believe it and yet I do.
Couldn't put it down but was so regretful that I read it.
Remember?
Is that the excuse for Clarice letting go of everything she felt so sure of?

I'M JUST HAPPY THAT UNLIKE SERIES PRODUCED BY "AARON SPELLING" WE CAN STILL PURCHASE OTHER SERIES THAT WE STILL LOVE TO WATCH.
SINCE I HAD NOT SEEN SEASON ONE, I CONVINCED MY SON TO BUY IT FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT AND I LOVED IT.
THEN FROM NINE TO TWELVE.
ABSOLUTELY NO ONE COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB.
I HAVE ONLY PURCHASED FOUR SEASONS.
SIX, SEVEN, AND EIGHT WERE ON SALE.
I STARTED WITH SEASON SIX,SEVEN AND EIGHT.
I'M NOT SURE IF I LIKE "JESSICA" MOVING FROM "CABOT COVE".
I AM SO HAPPY THAT FINALLY I CAN COMPLETE MY "MURDER SHE WROTE" COLLECTION.
BUT THEY WERE AND STILL ARE FUN TO WATCH.
OH, I AM SO LOOKING FORWARD TO BUYING EVERYTHING FROM TWO TO FIVE.
I ENJOYED THIS SHOW, THOUGH I DIDN'T SEE MANY OF THE EPISODES UNTIL THE NINETIES ROLLED IN.
I'LL HAVE TO WATCH MORE OF THE LATER EPISODES.
WHAT CAN I SAY!
BUT I WILL DEFINITELY HAVE THE TWELTH SEASON BEFORE TO LONG.
I DID NOT BEGIN PURCHASING MINE IN ORDER.

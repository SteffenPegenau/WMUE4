When my parents installed it, the picture came up in black and white.
The game itself is very boring.
Sophie (my sister) tried the first three levels and beat them all easily.
The box shows it in colour.
Now I am normally quite good at dancing games, having owning a dance mat myself, but I couldn't beat the last level.
She cried, 'Abby, you try!'
The box looked exciting.
This was a present for my six year old sister.
There are four coloured flowers on the mat, all you have to do is stand on them.
She screamed with delight at the sight of the box on Christmas morning!
I chose the first difficulty level just in case the others were too hard.
My sister was disapointed, but she just wanted to play the game.
This game is a total waste of time.
.
But the fourth level was so fast that she could hardly keep up with the lights.

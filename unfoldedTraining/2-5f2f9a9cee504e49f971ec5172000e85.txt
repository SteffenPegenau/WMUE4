They found each other and they fell in love.
I guess I'm not a person that likes to read books about love and war.
His real name was not Bill.
This book is about two young kids that find each other.
I really didn't like this book.
But if you like books about love and war, this is the book for you.
It's like, if you know what was going to happen next, why read the rest of the book?
This is not my type of book to read.
This book is about beating the odds and surviving with each other.The characters of this book are called Bill and Julie, but the boy in this book lies about his name.
When this was going on, there was a war.
This war was WWII.
This war was very dangerous and they were tying to survive it.
When you would read this book, you would know what would happen next and that did not make it interesting.
FireweedDo you like books about love and war?
This took place in London.
If you do you, will love Fireweed.
They both ran away from their homes and families.

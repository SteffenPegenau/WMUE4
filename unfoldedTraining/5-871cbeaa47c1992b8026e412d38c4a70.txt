U ARE TRULY A QUEEN OF SOUL /// ALONG SIDE ARETHA AND PATTI .
GOOD JOB GLADYS KNIGHT .
THIS ALBUM IS GOOD TO THE LAST DROP .
WOW WHAT A ALBUM .
I LOVE EVERY SONG OFF THIS ALBUM .
THIS MAKES ME WANT TO GO PURCHASE ANY ALBUM OF HERS THAT I DON'Y HAVE ALREADY .
I AM THE BIGGEST PATTI LABELLE FAN AND A BIG GLADYS KNIGHT FAN.
SONGS LIKE "LOVE HURTS AND IT DON'T" , AND THE FOLLOWING SONG W/ JAMIE FOXX IS FOR THE NEW AGE PEOPLE.
THEN YOU HAVE THE SONG "THE GREATEST LOVE OF ALL" FOR HER NEW CHRISTIAN BASED FANS.
THIS IS HER GREATEST ALBUM EVER .
IT HAS SONGS FOR EVERYBODY .
THEN SHE HAS "PLEASE HELP ME I'M FALLING IN LOVE W/ U" .
THIS SONG IS FOR THE OLD SCHOOL R&B FANS.
GLADYS KNIGHT HAS REINVENT HERSELF .
THIS IS A MUST HAVE .

Ernie Ball strings, whether they are super/regular/hybrid or whatever, are the best I have EVER played!!!
!
Ernie balls have never let me down.
They keep their edge longer than anything else.
They are just THAT good!
They don't go out of tune from simple bending.
You can't go wrong with these things.
I use the super slinky's on my floyd rose guitars and strats.
There is a reason that there are so many well known names on the back of the Ernie Ball package.
They don't go flat prematurely.
Keep on Rockin'!!
I use the heavy/light hybrids on the telecaster.
They don't break for no reason.
I love to use the regular sliky's on the les paul and sg style guitars.
I have tried everything out there.
I've been playing for over 25 years now, both professionally and for recreation.
They all work great!!!
The balls don't ever unwind.

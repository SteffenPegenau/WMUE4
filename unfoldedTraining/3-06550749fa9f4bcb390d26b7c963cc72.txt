I want to say right off that this is not an atrocious album.
That having been said, I have to say I'm just a teeny, eeny, weeny bit dissapointed.
The "we produced this by the skin of our teeth" edginess.
It's Interpol after all!
Where is the messy anquish of TOBL?
Sorry, but it's the difference between aged cheddar and an overprocessed slice of American cheese.
"Take You On A Cruise", "Evil", "Narc" - but "Slow Hands" is beneath them in my opionion.
The vocal arrangements are a bit too accessible and spoon fed for my taste.
There are some very fine songs on "Antics".
Hey, I think Interpol are brilliant.
What the heck, it's growing on me....
Of course it's better than most of the rubbish you will hear!
That feeling of tumbling head first into an Alison in Wonderland like vortex of gloriously chaotic emotion??
It all feels very studio-ish.
The first album conjured that feeling of a dark, smokey, gritty NYC club.

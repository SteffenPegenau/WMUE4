This game is absolutely horrible.
I thought about NBA 2K3 and NBA IDrive.
My friend also showed me his franchise.
Why the HELL would anyone make a stupid trade like that?
The game play was back and forth every time a fastbreak or a three pointer.
The Bulls offer you Jayson Williams (82) for Jason Kidd (94).
The one good and cool part in this game are the throwback jerseys that the teams wear.
It is just an all around bad game.
From the beginning NBA Live 2003 was out.
We were shocked.
When I got my XBOX I was looking for an NBA game.
One game the score after one quarter was 52-37 in a 6 MINUTE quarter.
Overall I'd rate this game a 1.9 out of 10.0.
These games aren't bad but no one plays em anymore.
I had previously owned NBA Live '99 and '00 for my PC.
The minute we got in a screen popped up.
I played it at my friends house, who had rented it.
I am a big basketball fan and obviously I am going to get a game.

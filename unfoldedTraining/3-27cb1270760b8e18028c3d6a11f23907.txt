The dog has a ruff, gruff, mean voice and will scare your child.
IT changed mine.
This video sucks all the enjoyment out of the book and makes a mockerey of it.
Your experience will change forever.
The "SNOOORRRT" is now a lot more disturbing then it was when you read it.
Buy the book.
Along with "Go Dog Go" and "The Best Nest" this video will ruin some of the three best child books ever created.
NO VIDEO!
Your kids will laugh no more.
Orginally you would think that the dog on the cover is sweet and calmly told the bird, "I am not your mother, I am a dog," this video changes this scenario.
You have shared this story with your child, am I right?
I advise you now.
Got it?
You walk into the store and say, "Hey they actually made a video out of that," Before you put it in your cart, let me give you a breif warning of what is to come.
You have all read this story, am I right?

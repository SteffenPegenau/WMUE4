They never needed it in Europe.
It gave memory errors in Europe and would never, ever work.
Never, ever acquired a satellite.
It was balky until we updated it, then it was fine.
Now it works fine.
VERY BAD IDEA.
So you are not missing anything.
DON'T USE ANY INTERNAL MEMORY.
I bought this to send with my wife and niece on a road trip from Florence to Barcelona.
Very, very big disappointment.
On a hunch, I deleted all the photos and songs.
My wife has had another Garmin unit for years.
Thought it was still in L.A.
If you want to use these features, try using an SD card, and you might need to take the card out when you are navigating.The sandbag holder works great in L.A.
We used the Nuvi 370 in L.A.
When they got home, I tried it and it would not acquire a satellite, even after 20 minutes.
I did not see this documented anywhere, and I am kind of a geek.It was awfully slow to load photos, and did not sound good.
Just before the trip, I loaded photos and songs on it.

It's such a happy song.
I was listening to the CD and I saw that it my computer said this CD was 71 min and 46 sec long.
I just knew that there a bonus track.
It's defenitly one you should get if want a CD with good beats and rockin lyrics.
Life is good!!!
69 is a bonus track called "Weeping Willow".
Mostly Rich.
So I scaned the CD.
I love all the songs, but "Life Is Good" has to be my favorite.
Hey I just got this CD today and it's great.
It's so great that it's hard to choose a favorite.
Why else would they put 54 empty tracks?
This CD is awsome.
And plus all the songs are written by LFO themselves.
I was like what?
It's a great song.
15-68 are nothing they are blank and about 12 sec longs.
It has 69 tracks.

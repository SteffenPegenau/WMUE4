LOL!
I bought this hoping he would turn into the miracle pet everyone wants.
I bought this for my cat this summer.
Well that didn't happen.
He's got a funny personality and likes to be alone.
It can be strong, and I don't like it.
if it works.
It's really a matter of personality in his case, not anger or fear.
I gave it 4 stars because I'm sure it's a great product as it seems to work for everyone else.
I love him regardless!
Similiar to basic soap, like when you buy bubbles.
I used it merely to see if it would make my cat a happier one, but he's just a typical Garfield!
I have noticed he is around me more now that I've stopped using it.
He hates to be touched and sometimes can be angry if you do.
: )
The cuddly loving type.
But I DID notice a smell.
I'm not sure if I noticed any change in his behavior at all.

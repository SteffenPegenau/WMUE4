My heart started pounding with excitement when the opening music blared and the Star Wars logo appeared on the screen.
The computer generated effects are distracting and cartoonish.
What a letdown.
I think I'll skip Episode II.
The finale is laughable.
You can never tell, so after a while- who cares?
What a bummer.
Who's ahead?
It was all downhill from there.
The much-hyped pod racer scene is dull and free of suspense- how many laps are left?
Liam Neeson's and Ewan McGregor's talents are totally wasted.
:(
Can't hold a candle to the speeder bike chase in Return of the Jedi- or any scene in the original trilogy for that matter.
Natalie Portman's performance is wooden, and what's with that accent?
I'm a diehard Star Wars fan, and I can't tell you how mediocre this film is.

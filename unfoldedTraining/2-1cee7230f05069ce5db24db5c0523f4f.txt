The fielding is unrealistic.
The MLB series just suck so amazingly its not even funny.
I truly reccomend MVP Baseball 2004 over this.
This game was horrible.
This game was soooo stupid.
Half the plays I didn't make in MLB '05, I could've made in MVP '04.
The batting was horrible.
If you quit a game in the middle, you can't simulate the rest of it.
It didn't have the pure swing system.
The graphics suck, as in the player faces suck.
Overall, this game sux.
Barry Bonds isn't in the game.
The pitching was even worse, I put the cursor in one place it ends up not even close to where I put it.
That's it.
I'd say the best lookin' thing in the game is the uniforms.
The commentators bore the crap out of me espcially that Scully dude.

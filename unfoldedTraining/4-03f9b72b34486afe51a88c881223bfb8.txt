Well worth your time and $.
I do however, think both scenes are ludicrous!
Sarah and Cahill are two of the most likeable characters around.
I have a whole new respect for 'butlers'!
Nifty story.
The mystery develops logically and ends appropriately.
I would actually give it a 4.5 as it is close to perfect.
I keep seeing things sagging and swinging!
I don't object due to modesty - far from it.
Enjoy!
It's not supposed to be THAT funny!
And leave it to Howard to provide moments of hilarity and lots of truly hot sex!
I only have a problem with two scenes: the nude wrestling and Sarah with the lamp.
Overall, a great romantic thriller with a grand ending.
I loved this latest by Linda Howard.

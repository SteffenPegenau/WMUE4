It wasn't bad at all.
Go Musiq!
I liked his other albums, but no song beat "Just Friends."
So, when I got this album, I'd lost hope in getting that song that I would connect to.
Finally, a song that is on the level of "Just Friends."
After I connected with "Teachme," for some reason, the album got a thousand times better.
I got to "Teachme" and grinned from ear to ear.
Musiq has a beautiful, soulful voice that softens the heart and gets my head nodding.
I listened to the album about six or seven times and finally went for a long walk with this cd in my player.
Not only is the song wonderfully expressed, but it definitely is a song I can relate to.
Ever since Musiq's song "Just Friends," I've always looked for that ONE song that would stamp the close-eyes-snap-fingers emotion in me.
I really like it now!
I liked it.
"Teachme" is going to be my jam forever.
It took me a minute to get into this album.

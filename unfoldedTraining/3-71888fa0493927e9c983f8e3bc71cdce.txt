IN TURRET MODE, PRIME'S TRAILER IS LIKE ATTACK MODE.
I MEAN THAT HE LOOKS MEAN WITH THE MOUTH.
WHEN YOU OPEN HIS CHEST, YOU WILL SEE A MATRIX.
IN ROBOT MODE, HE LOOKS WEIRD.
HIS HEAD LOOKS SILLY.
I'M NOT A FAN OF RED, GRAY, BLUE, YELLOW, BLACK, AND GOLD ON THE WHEELS.
PRIME STILL LOOKS COOL.
YES, PRIME IS COMBINED WITH HIS TRAILER.
IT FEATURES AN AWESOME FUNCTION.
NOTHING DIFFERENT.
NO, PRIME ISN'T THAT EXPENSIVE TO BUY FOR PRE-ORDER NEXT MONTH.
HIS JAPANESE NAME WAS GALAXY CONVOY BECAUSE THE JAPANESE VERSION OF CYBERTRON IS GALAXY FORCE.
STILL OPTIMUS IS COOL AND TOUGH.
HIS WEAPON IS ATTACHED THERE BECAUSE EVERY CYBERTRON FIGURE INCLUDES A CYBER PLANET KEY.
IN VEHICLE MODE, OPTIMUS PRIME IS A FUTURISTIC TRUCK W/TRAILER.
IN SUPER MODE, HE NOW HAS A MOUTHPLATE.
HE WAS KINDA BULKY AND STRANGE.
IN JET MODE, IT LOOKS LIKE A TRUCK WITH WINGS.

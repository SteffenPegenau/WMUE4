And for that, I am completely satisfied.
But my son is so funny about things, he refuses just to place a homemade word sign into the sentence.
The only problem I have is that it's missing simple words like "did".
However, I have to give the company credit.
Instead, he will totally change his sentence.
Now if they will create an 'additional words' kit, life would be perfect.
I was happy to see that it came with "n't" and "es", so you could add onto words.
;o)
IT IS AN AMAZING TOOL FOR MY SON!!!
He can read and he can write, but he has a problem getting the words from his mind onto paper.
An added bonus, being able to see his words, he's correcting his own speech!
That is the ONLY problem I've had with the set.
They probably never figured on their product being used in this way.
He took to this instantly.
I bought this for my son with Aspergers.

Gameplay quality - perfect!
I wanted to charge the battery so it would be functional when she opened it.
The video - even better!
I charged the battery and then thought I better test the Need for Speed Carbon edition!
The Sony looks better (the body of it) but the game play, video and sound are astounding on the Nintendo DS Lite!!
Anyway, only downside, limited game selection.
OH, I could go on for hours on this product!
We could hardly sit it down!
!
This is the best portable gaming unit I have ever had!
The quality of the unit is top notch!
I would have taken it everywhere I went but it is pink : )This was no disappointment!
I spent the next 2 days playing on it!
The sound - excellent!
I purchased this for my daughter (young woman) for her birthday; this has been the best gift I ever got her!
This is better than the Sony PSP!
I was playing with it and my girlfriend saw it and took it from me, she spent the next 2 days playing with it!

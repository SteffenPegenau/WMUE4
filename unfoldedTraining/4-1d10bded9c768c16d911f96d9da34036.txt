I suggest it to anybody... you heard me...
!- Liam Klaxon, VA
But let me tell all of you something.
FREEEEE!!!!
NO FEES...
YOU can play locally in your city, or ANYWHERE around the world!!!
I got this for my B-day, and it was the best thing i got!
An also addition to this game is that there are over 200 severs for online!!!
FOREVER!!
Just click multiplayer when you download the game,and you go into ONLINE multiplayer action!!
DONT buy this product for the campaign mode (or adventure mode, etc...) buy it for the online multiplayer!!!
thats right... FREE...
ANYBODY.
and the best part... the ONLINE multiplayer is...
EVER!!!
I couldnt believe, no payments.
I hope this was a helpful review!!
Definately an AWESOME game.
I couldnt even believe that there was no hook-up cords to the computer you needed!

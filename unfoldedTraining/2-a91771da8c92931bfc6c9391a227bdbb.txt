AAAhhhhh to be in the company of sane men.Luck to all you men.
Let me first say.
But according to this book, it's best to let you women PMS yourself silly and hold on tight till it's over.
She want to clean things.3.
I saw my girlfried in pain and I wanted to help.
WE ARE MEN.
She crabby.2.
From what I have experience I'll be joining a monastery in the morning.
Hence the reason for my purchase of this book.
Guys,If you are looking for answers to why your girl friend goes nuts 1 week out of the month, this is not the book for you.
You know what?
She wants to [have sex].And before you women start in on the male bashing.
Other wise, it does not give any more insight into a woman cycle other than;1.
Actually if you take the author advice and disappear that week, then maybe this book is for you.
WE WANT TO FIT THINGS.

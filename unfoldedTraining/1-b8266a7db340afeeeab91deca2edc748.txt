Not very interesting, does not hold your attention.
He doesn't really grasp the history of that area & what one had to go thru to establish oneself.
You can tell this guy is a liberal academe with an agenda.
This book is more about anti-capitalism & racism then anything.
The worst book on King Ranch I've ever read.
You get to read more anti-King & Kleberg bull than is necessary.
Also, his dislike of the Texas Rangers was throughout the book.
This is typical revisionist history & not recommended to getting a balanced view of this magnificent family & history of that area.
Anti-white as usual.
One sentence.
It just slips up on you.
Of course there wasn't any Mexican racism this guy saw to much.
I don't believe he was fair on both sides.
If you aren't paying close attention, you'll read right over when Capt.
King dies.

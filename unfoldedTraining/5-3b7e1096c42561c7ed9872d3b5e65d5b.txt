Listened to this first in the 70's.
Their logo was a guy with a big boot about to kick someone in the a$$.
It's great!
How can you go wrong with that?
They were realtively unknown.
Don't know about the bonus tracks, though.
Some friends in a local Chicago Southside band played several of the songs.
Overall a solid album.
Long live that early German rock.
album recommends playing at maximum volume.
Guitar solos very good.
Wonder what the kids of today might think of it.
Rate it with some of Zeppelins early albums.
Not one clinker in the bunch.
On Billingsgate Records, I think.

I need this originally for a subwoofer low pass filter.
They come broken due to shipping, not due to Pyle.As an honest, gifted, educated individual.
WOW!
Well now I have my whole system custom tuned and effects running out of 6 different channels to 8 different amplifiers!
...
VERY HIGH QUALITY VERSATILE EQUIPMENT.
It's because shipping amplifiers is hard business.
One input can branch to 3 different RCA combinations and 3 different TRS 1/4 options!
People bad talk Pyle, and I know why.
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Listen.
The combinations are endless with piggy backed cables.Two year warranty, amazon credibility... BUY NOW!
All stereo, all high quality, all effective.Turns right on.
My Pyle amplifier works great, and my crossover works even better.I bought this used from amazon.com.
Light weight, strong design.

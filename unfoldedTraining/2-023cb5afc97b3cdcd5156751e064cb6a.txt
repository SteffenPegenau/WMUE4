Even Totally Hits was better.
Whoever made this should be punished.I've listened to some pop before.
If you wanna hear raraties, this is NOT for you.
If you want a coaster collection for fun, this is for you.
I like BSB, Evan and Jaron, LiT, Eve6, Jay-Z, et.
Those are the worst picks on a compilation CD.
al.
Now!
6 was better but that's not saying much.
If you really hate CDs and like the songs released better, this is for you.
I can't believe this collection!
And still do sometimes.
Starting off good, then downhill.
If listening to fake overplayed music is music, then I guess it is.
But not Britney, Nine Days, and N Sync.
AVOID.If you want a good compilation, try the Short Music For Short People.
It's only songs that get played 24/7/365.

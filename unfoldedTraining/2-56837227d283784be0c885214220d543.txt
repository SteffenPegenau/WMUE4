Who wants a seventies hippie type hero???
Gray hair?
Not to mention airheaded, fickle, frigid, naive, and God knows what all else (but none of it very good).
Sorry this one is NOT a good one.
Spend your money on another author.
Birkenstocks???
Hailey North is purely a hit or miss author.
Please!
- Yuck!
I don't think I'll waste any more money on her books.
The last two books I've read of hers have been awful though.
Going to bed early, which is NOT a sign of a good book.
Did I mention immature?
So, basically, heroine has nothing going for her but looks, and hero has nothing going for him but money...where does this leave us?
No...sorry...uh uh...not doing anything for me.
There was another reviewer who expressed my sentiments exactly about the "hero", Alistair.
And Lauren, the "heroine", seemed really, really immature.

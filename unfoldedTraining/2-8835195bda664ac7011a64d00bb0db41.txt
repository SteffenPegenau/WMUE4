Like most of you, I am a Nicks fan and have all her solo work.
I really like Street Angel, much more than this release.
All the press people yelp about a "return to form" and a "modern classic."
Liked about three songs.
Hmmmm.
Like Elton, the hype machine went into gear.
Hey, all we really want from these 50somethings is a good album.
Well, this album is probably my least favorite.
I listened to it once.
Not much sticks out.
I listened, but this album isn't the classic we heard so much about.
No great expectations.
Also, I think we all know it--sales dropped off pretty fast and like Elton's latest, it wasn't the "hit" everyone thought it was going to be.
Listened to it a few more times.
Sort of reminds me of Elton's WEST COAST album.

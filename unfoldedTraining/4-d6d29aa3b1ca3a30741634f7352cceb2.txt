It is dramatic, but they are not scared at all to use sarcastic comedy and common sense to make you laugh.
This show is an easy 5.
It's a comedy drama.
And it's not an entire episode.But you should by all means buy the DVD.
You won't regret it.
What they fail to mention is that it's not for the entire episode and it's not the entire cast.
It's certain members for certain scenes in each episode.
Not a drama comedy.
The dvd is a bit lacking.
So when I read "Cast & Crew Commentary on every episode".
No problem at all.
I want to work in the entertainment industry as a writer and maybe director.
I find all the behind the scenes features and commentary very interesting.
That sounds like a what dream to me with the cast they have.
Out of all the shows I watch (Burn Notice, Psych, Lost, 24, The Big Bang Theory, Transformers Animated & The Spectacular Spider-Man) this is just the absolute best show.However.
My main issues is what they say they have and what they have.

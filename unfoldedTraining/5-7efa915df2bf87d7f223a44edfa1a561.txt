Hard to say.
I always thought the accordion was a pretty stupid instrument myself.
OK.
Imagine this: four guys enter the stage, pick up their instruments and start to play.
I know.
But adding some guitar peddle effects to the accordion greatly improves its sound.
What are they playing?
Definitely too interruptive ;-)
Same for violin, cello (which in fact can be played as one would play a guitar) and clarinet.Oh.
And you should hear them play their cover of Eleanor Rigby (Beatles).Although most of DAAU's music is instrumental, this is no shopping music version.
It might be jazz, except that it's not.
All I can say is that it tends to be loud and fast.
But then, it certainly isn't classical, pop or rock.
What are they playing on?
Hold tight: violin, cello, clarinet and accordion (!).

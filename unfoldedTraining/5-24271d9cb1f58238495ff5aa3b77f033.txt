However, all that I can tell you is that "It" is a good novel.
And that's pretty darn good.
Seven children, however, defeat it...but not for long...It's back.
And It's hungry.
He's struck silver a few times; never anything less than bronze.
However, It is more powerful than they ever imagined It could...Stephen King has struck gold repeatedly in his career.
A long one, to be true, but it--"It"--doesn't read that way.
How unspeakable?
It doesn't even have a name; just It.
It's Stephen King at his gripping, horrific, terrifying best.
Together, the original band that fought It must return to Derry, discarding the lives they have made in their absence.
I don't know if "It" qualifies as gold or not; you'd have to ask the judges.
But It lurks under the town of Derry, Maine, and has a peculiar taste for children.
Strangers, originally, now brought together by an unspeakable evil.
Seven friends.

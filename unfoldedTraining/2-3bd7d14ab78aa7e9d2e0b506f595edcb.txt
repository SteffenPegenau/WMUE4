its like this customer i had at work the other day bacause you see I'm like a waiter.
Well, this guy just ordered his second plate of buffalo wings--no fooling!--and i was like "ReallY!"
so here's the deal.
man that dude likes buffalo wings.
Its all about this bad guy whos like the leader of England and he's bad.
Fashcist.
Fascism is bad.
so this dude dressed like one of the three musketeers wants to kill him and save the country from the evil governemnt people who watch everybody all the time and don't allow freedom.
Its okay, i guess.
and his friend went "Dude, your not supose to say that!"
I hate fascists.So anyway about the movie.
Pretty exciting.
i hate faschists.
good ideas.
I gave it two stars cuz things can always be better you know i don't want to be a brown noser or anything
and I said "sorry" and the dude was all "Shut Up Tad!"

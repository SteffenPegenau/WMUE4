Would have preferred some instructions from the grower... but so far I am happy with the results.
Planted the roots and the next morning saw new growth on all 10 plants.
I'll Call them....
If my $5.44 for shipping and handling wasn't enough to cover an instruction sheet and I can get through for help....
NO PLANTING INSTRUCTIONS!
No Problem...
I'll just look on the website...
The phone just rang and rang and finally a fax picked up screaming at me those wonderful tones.
NO LABEL....
I ordered this product with great expectations....
NO TIPS, NO INFORMATION.
I think next time I will buy locally.UPDATE 3-22-12:OK I did some surfing and found a site that recommended soaking the bare-roots... Did that for 3 hours in a miracle-grow and water bath...
I got a box with bare roots in a generic zip loc bag.
NOTHING for Planting or growing instructions.... No Problem...
I know they are strawberry plants....but what variety...I am left to Guess.

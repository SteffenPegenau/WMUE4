=) Every song on here is energetic and entertaining.
Waiting for that DVD!
I was surprised by Control of the Knife, I must admit I didn't care for that particular song but then I see it live and just, wow!
However, I've yet to see Out of Control.
!
I tried searching for this DVD as a Region 1 (bc I live in the United States.
The Black Jacks performance is really good too, the dancing is great.
The girls kill it w/ Fling, Sexy!
So yes, make sure you can play this product before purchasing.
The girls bring their A-game!
Just make sure your DVD player can play PAL or Region 0 discs, otherwise you probably won't be able to watch this DVD.
), but I could not find it.
I was blown away by every single song.
I love the behind the scenes doc, very cute.
No No No, Love Machine...
But overall, yes yes yes buy this DVD!!
Girls Aloud live shows are fantastic, this is probably my favorite concert of theirs thus far.
*sigh* I wish the girls would come over here!
The list goes on.

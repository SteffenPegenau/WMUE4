Not so impressed with it now, was expecting this to last several years, not just a year and a half.
Other than that, can't think of any issues with it.
The only down side is that the numbers have worn off the timer knob.
It wasn't from wiping/scrubbing, but just by use.
It really does crank out the heat, but that hasn't been an issue for me.

Very annoying.
All the numbers have rubbed off on the timer now and the timer is broken.
When we use the stay on, the timer kicks on and won't stop ticking.
Fast forward to 1 1/2 years of using this oven, having issues now.
I love my convection oven.

Also smelled something electrical burning this evening.
I've had it for about 4 months now.

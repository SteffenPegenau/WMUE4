Hmmm.
"Band on the Run"?
"Again and Again and Again"?
"Live and Let Die"?
.
As a result, Wings will now continue to be seen mainly as a vehicle for Paul McCartney, when that simply isn't true.
"Time to Hide"?
You just don't do it.
Wings was a band.
I can live with these, definitely.
"Let Em In"?
It amazes me that they can anthologize this group and sell so short the contributions of Denny Laine, who any fan will know was the heart, soul, and muscles of Wings.
A unit.Now if you'll forgive me, I'm going to go listen to my own self-made version of Wingspan - the DENNY-FIED version!
.for a Wings greatest hits CD, this is a pretty good Paul McCartney best-of.
But where are "Children Children"?
Making a Wings best of without Denny is akin to making a Beatles best of without John.
Unjustly shelved, that's where they are.
A team.

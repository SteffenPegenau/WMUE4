It would have been great to have them all dance around like "Thriller" but that is not Mr.Campbell's style.
This movie has an interesting concept.
Yeppers.
And honest to mercy Mummy.
If you are a fan of Mr. Campbell and his brand of humor you will like this movie.
I will try not to give aything away.
The only thing keeping it from being too campy is he doesn't stumble around with his arms out in front of him dripping "mummy wrappings".
This is a Bruce Campbell movie and I have a soft spot for his brand of humor...especially in the "horror" genre.
There is also a black and very much alive John F. Kennedy.
In this typical vehicle there is a really odd, live Elvis (think breathing Beetlejuice) that you just can't look away from even if you wanted to!
:)
And then there is the mummy.
And that is basically what it comes down to.
That's about all I have to say about that character.
If you do not like his brand of humor...why the heck did you buy it in the first place?

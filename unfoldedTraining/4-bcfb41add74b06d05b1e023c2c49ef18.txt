Why am I giving this cd 4 1/2 stars?
"El Disco Anal" is also very danceable.
Why can't the variety shows of Univision, Telemundo or Galavision promote a sensational group like this?
I started to enjoy everything here until "Balada de Chusy" which hits a sour note.
Great cover photo-oh so '60s!
Great dance music fromVenezuela of all places!
"Mi Linda" is a classic and I wish the track was longer.
This is a great discovery!
I first heard this cd by Los Amigos Invisibles at work thanksto my boss.
How about adding some Daft Punk to it?
Skip the track and enjoy "The New Sound Of The Venezuela Gozadera".
It is very funky and very beautiful.
It really caught me by surprise.
1 reviewer called " Mi Linda" a cross between Armand van Helden and Gipsy Kings.
It sounds as if Don Fagen and Walter Becker teamed up with Los Amigos: a gorgeous jazzy tune.
I will still place this in my Top 10 best of 2000.
"Cachete a Cachete" echoes Steely Dan.

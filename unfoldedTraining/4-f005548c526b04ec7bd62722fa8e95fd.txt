Thats what stories are for, right?
And what is he going to do, considering what he knows.
It could happen.
The plot is more far fetched then unbelieveable.
I dont know where any bad reviews are coming from.
A nice excape for sure.
Cant do it.
I sped through this page turner laughing like a hienea.
It is light and funny.
This book is not deep or very complicated.
Its not all about lust, it is more how men and lust equals love.
Someone elses imagination is us readers entertainment.
So its worth it.
Only he cant run.
I enjoyed it and will read more titles under this author.
This is alot lighter, more like knee slapping funny.
A man who does not admit to what he really feels, you know the hard headed, cant look deeper then the surface type who run when things start going somewhere.
Dont go in expecting Linda Howard or anything.
So, it is interesting to see how she is going to get out of her situation.

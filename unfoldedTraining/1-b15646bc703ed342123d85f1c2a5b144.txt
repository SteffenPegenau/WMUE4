It is so disturbing.What a sad piece of film making.
This is an older show.
I only experienced the 60's at Coney Island!
The heavy hands who made it tried too hard.
Coney was a place of joy for millions of people!
This doc shows non of that.
This is a scene where they show the electrocution of an elephant!
I wanted to see the old Coney my dad told me about.
Sorry, but there is NO joy in this piece.
Do not let a child watch.
There are some good film pieces that show much of the parks that existed, but there is so little joy and happiness, and there are long voice over quotes from famous writers and such that linger on sad pictures with even sadder music!BEWARE>>>>> there is SEVERE animal cruelty shown in this!!!!
Made in 1990.
So disappointing they felt this was needed.
There should be a warning on this!
This is a very sad over blown doc.
It is totally unnecessary and cruel to show.

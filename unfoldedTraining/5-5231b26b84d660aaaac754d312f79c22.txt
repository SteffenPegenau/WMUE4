He couldn't get enough of it.
I wondered about the practicality of it for his age.
Once he got the hang of it he couldn't be stopped.
It rates 5 stars for the fun factor.
This gift was a present for my 2yo grandson.
It brought tears to my eyes.
He loved it.
His eyes got wide as saucers and lit up like candles.
I see this as something that he will never tire of.
I highly recommend it if you want to be the hero <s>
I shouldn't have.
I think this is the best thing he has gotten to date.
It was a sight to behold.
His 7 yo brother loved it also.
It rates 5 stars for eye/hand coordination <education> and I'm hoping that it will last forever.

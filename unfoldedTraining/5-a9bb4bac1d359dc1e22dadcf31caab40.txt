And it works.
Did I mention it sounds great?This isn't all prog house of course.
...This album feels dangerous in all the right places.
It breaks like Adam Freeland.
Its sleazy the way Lawler wishes he was.
Starts to finish.But maybe most important is that it was realesed by Global Underground.
It just brought the fun back...one more time.Essential!
This is a mix.
They might not all payoff, but enough do.
Its acidic the way Christopher Lawrence used to be and it has more implied sex than it has any right to.
This is a set.
This album doens't save them completely.
The head of Mo'Wax couldn't foreget his beat based roots.
Lately GU has become too formulatic.
The label that was once the inovator, the leader.
Most important it takes chances.

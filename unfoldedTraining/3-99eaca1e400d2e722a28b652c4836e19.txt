It is rock.
You may be asking yourself why only 3 stars?
The first, second and final tunes and best.
Very cool.
No more, no less.
Because that is what it Ranks relative to their other output.
It requires multiple listens from beginning to end.
The disc is a little work but a lotta worth it.
Judge the disc by this review.
It's short so that's easy.
This is not a pop record.
Like i've said before, check out all of MainMan Michael Rank's other releases as solo, Clarrisa, Marat and early S.O.P.
Don't get me wrong.
As a matter of fact, i like to crank the final tune to ear splitting levels while on repeat to get the full effect.
It's a thick, muddy crunch of a record.
I love pop but this disc is some other beast.
It's all good, as the saying goes.
Amazon have listed the song titles incorrectly so don't go by that.

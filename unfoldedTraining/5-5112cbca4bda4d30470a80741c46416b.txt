Bjork -you are a true artist.
This is my favourite film.
Bjork really fits the character and this film is just so emotional.
This film is spectacular.
Not in the fairytale way.
It's what would truly happen in reality not in Hollywood.I've always viewed Bjork as a confident, organic soul, but on this film she is humble, fragile and absolutely beautiful.
Though it's ending is haunting and <sad>, it is real.
Far better than any other film debuts by the other divas, this kills Whitney's Bodyguard, slaughters mercilessly Mariah's Glitter and crucifies anything Madonna has done.
It's believeable, though by reading the plot it seems a bit cliched.
I'm sorry but you are going to have to Watch this.
Even if you hate Bjork's music.
Bjork's film overwhelmed me.
She is excellent as an actress.
(...)Haunting...You'll be writing your own "Selma Songs" after watching this.
Because it portrays real life.

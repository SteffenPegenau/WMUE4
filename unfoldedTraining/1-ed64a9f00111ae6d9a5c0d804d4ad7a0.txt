Each time it tried an automatic update it failed around 88%.
It really causes a hassle.
Half-Life turned out to be 1 of only a few games, that I have ever returned in my 20+ years of gaming.
However, it happened four (4!!)
It would not have been bad if it happened only once.
This was compounded by the fact that no one ever contacted me to help.
I am not sure about this method of gaming that forces you to login to the internet each time.
I even scoured message boards and followed their advice.
I really liked the game, and it was disappointing to me that I could not get the problems worked out.
The online game system, somehow managed to change the settings that I set for it to not automatically update.
I asked them for help every way possible.
I sent messages and problem reports.
This of course caused me to lose my progress in the game each time.
times.
I never have had such a hard time with a game before.

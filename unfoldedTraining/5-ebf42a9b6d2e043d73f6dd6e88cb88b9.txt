I'll be buying another unit for my garage.
This week alone we have zapped 7 mice.
They can't resist the PB!
Just place a damp cloth or napkin, as a welcome mat, in front of the Zapper.
Batteries last a long time, good product and good service.
We have had great success with this unit.
I can have the Zapper in our crawl space and the plug in mouse out in the hall.
The mice walk on it, making a better contact when they go over the zap pad, then..BAM!
The best bait is some peanut butter between 2 pieces of crunchy dog food (included).
Not only does this product work, but the support is great too.
One email to the company and within 24 hours they sent a solution.
No problems since that solution was suggested.
This is the time they start to look for winter homes.
At the start of the season, the device activated several times, and when I checked it, no mouse.
I also recommend the plug in mouse that has flashing ears when the trap is activated.

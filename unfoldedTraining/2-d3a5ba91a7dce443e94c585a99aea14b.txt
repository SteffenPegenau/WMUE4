I want my romance novels to center around the romance.
They were hilarious, fun, satisfying romances.
This one didn't.
With "The Book of True Desires" (and even her last book, "The Book of Seven Delights") she is venturing too far into the Raiders of the Lost Ark territory.
Sadly, I didn't relate to her at all.
They all felt lacking in some way, all searching for "home", none feeling too terribly beautiful.
I hope that in the future Krahn creates more of those endearing characters.
Are these screenplays for adventure movies?
Her heroine is gorgeous, confident, and accomplished, right from the get-go.
Krahn's earlier heroines were so much more appealing.
I loved Krahn's "Test" books.
There is certainly action here, but I feel cheated.
These just turned me off.
That's not what I want when I pick up a romance novel.
Crazy, twist-and-turn-type plots can only carry a writer so far.

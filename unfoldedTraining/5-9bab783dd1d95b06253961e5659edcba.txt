Wow, what a game!
The AI in this is really good too.
You don't have to know anything about anything.
The other thing I would love to mention are the 3D objects.
You can have up to 10 computer players wrecking the place.
If you love action games, simulation games, and somewhat realistic (more or less) than this is for you!
it has the computer players difficulty.
Things like : cars, semi's, truckes, trains, ect.
The places you choose all have unique objects such as trees, tractors, barns, water towers, observation towers, ect.
Think I like it?
Go get it and you WILL see what I mean!
The new things this has ROCKS!
It also has MOVING objects!
And they can hit you too!
I thought motocross madness 1 was good!
On every mode you choose, (stunt quarry, Enduro, National Race, supercross, ect.)
I just happen to love crashing.

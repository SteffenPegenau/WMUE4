But this recording is just so odd.
Her Desdemona!
Way too bright and chirpy for such a profoundly devotional song.
Let me just preface my comments by saying that I am a huge Fleming fan and consider her pretty much the gold standard for good singing, musical intelligence and character interpretation.
Her Rusalka...) Maybe that's why I'm so disappointed by this one.
And very rushed.
Cecilia Bartoli's prayerful rendition on "A Hymn for the World 2" (with Myung-Whun Chung) makes Renee's version seem circus-like.
And as someone else noted, the Panis Angelicus was atrocious.

The flute intro was so wrong in so many ways.
The Laudate Dominum seemed way too fast.
(Her Manon!
I just can't help but think Miss Fleming knows better than this.

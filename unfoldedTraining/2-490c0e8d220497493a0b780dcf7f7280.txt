and i dont understand why people are all over kevins balls saying hes this great songwriter.
i was expecting a prog rock masterpeice seeing the lineup and hearing the reviews.
thank god hes not in dream theater anymore if this would have been pushed into their sound that would have blown.
i dont understand the hype about this album.
rudess blows this dude into dust.
but this album just does not deliver.
now on the plus side.
check out these newish albumsFrost - MilliontownDream theater - Systematic chaosriverside - second life syndromeredemption - origins of ruin
mike portnoy plays great and so does Shaun malone.
the rhythem section is great.
not impressed.
and i was NOT impressed by kev moore one bit.
but thats about it.
ok, i was not a big fan of their debuit, but that album is a gem in comparison to this.
major potental no delivery.
and this is not progressive rock....want good prog rock?

It's remained in my car's cd player for over a month.
If you want awesome guitar solos buy Fate's Warning "No Exit" CD.
If you are you should love this album.
However this album, after listening to it many times has really grown on me especially Invisable Kid, Sweet Amber and The Unnamed Feeling.
It rocks and rocks hard.
You can feel the anger when you listen to it.
(Just my opinion :-) P.S.
Due to the fact that I love guitar solos so much I withheld one star in my four star rating.
I will admit however that none of my friends or relatives share my opinion.
Obviously not everyone is going to like this type of hard rock.
I think that's what they intended.
I love guitar solos and their old stuff as much as any devoted Metallica fan.
Come on Metallica you fell just short of a perfect album.
If I want my wife or friends to go away I just pop in St Anger.
If you wanna 'bang your head' this is the album to do it to.

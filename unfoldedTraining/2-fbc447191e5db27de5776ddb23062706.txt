Read this quote from the book "An Oriental couple--Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese?
However, I cannot help to think that Haywood Smith is quite racist.
I could never tell--hovered close to the register...A young black couple with a runny-nosed baby argued in some kind of an indecipherable rap jargon..." Wow!
Well, I must say that I am far from a fifty year old Southern Belle.
I am quite surprised she has continued to publish to be honest.
I finished it.
It is no longer the same she says as she describes all the different cultures that she observes.
Maybe you need to be from Georgia to truly enjoy this book.
If you read the book, you will know what I am talking about.
I went with it.
It is hard to explain.
Even found some parts funny.
I really think that she is going for strictly White Southern Belle middle-age woman as her audience.
She does not come out and say it.
Don't get me wrong.
She keeps being nostalgic about the way her old Georgia used to be.

The only good things are the capacity the speed to change songs and the Super screen very nice.
It is small but it does not fit in a pocket; Also it is a little heavy.
(...)
Then by accident, I unpluged it from the power.
I am not at the US to return it so I hire somebody to fix it.
He had to format the hard drive again and to repair a small pin that makes contact with the battery.
Also It does not organize your songs on the hard drive so it is a mess and If you have a large collection of songs.
Now it is working but sometimes it stop working and I have to reset it every time at least once per day.
it will be very boring.
It stopped working.
The letter case is not very nice.
It could not access the hard drive.
The consequences were very bad.
I have bought this mp3 to be use in my car and home stereo.
The day I recived it, I have started to charge it and at the same time to move my music to it.

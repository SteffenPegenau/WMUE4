But thats me.
The advice given on this dvd is awesome!!
with adv.
So get ready for a lot of Country/Rock licks.
The details on soloing are what matters!
You could probably grow into this in time, but it would be an adventure!
This is not beginner friendly!
I've been playing 40 yrs.
music theory in my back pocket.
It's almost to much country for me!
So beware!!
Arlen Roth's style is a combo of country and rock.
Some of the advice given is so deep in theory I had to stop the dvd and think for a few minutes before continuing.
You better have some music theory training in your back pocket before trying this!!

The picture quality on all the films was really the best thing about the box set.
When I heard about it coming to DVD I was very excited.
Thanks for reading.
The first Rocky sounded the best, Rocky V sounded good but so did my VHS tape with my pro logic system.
I looks great, it's packaged very well.
No deleted scenes in any of the films.
Rocky II,III; and IV I thought the sound felt dated, there wasn't must bass though my 5.1 system, II and III was more like 5.0.
Maybe I'm a little harsh but for the 25th anniversary collection I thought it could have been must must better.
There was lots of extras on the first Rocky.
Stallone interview.
Rocky II and Rocky V are only Dolby 2.0 Surround.
I preordered it and finally got it.
Stallone is my favorite actor of all time, and the character Rocky he portray's is my favorite as well.
But I found several things I didn't like.
But the only thing I really enjoyed was the 30 min.

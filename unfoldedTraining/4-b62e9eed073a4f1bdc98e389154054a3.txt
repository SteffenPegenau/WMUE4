In songs like "Only Human" there are heavy guitar riffs.
They have a little techno sound.
It doesn't really sound like anyone else out there right now.
The song that most people have heard is "All Mapped Out" which could be a song by The Bravery too.
It's a cool sound overall.
In many of their songs, The Departure have good dynamics.
They are maybe like The Bravery if they could play their instruments.
They have a hard rock sound too.
They have good surf guitar riffs.
They vocals are really British sounding.
They might be a good band to see live.
In other words, they are probably more like The Fall.
"Lump In My Throat" reminds me of Echo and the Bunnymen.
It's a little like The Bravery.
The Departure is another of the new British bands who are yet to crash upon American shores.
In fact this is an import and not released here yet.

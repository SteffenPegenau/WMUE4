Probably would have been a better cd that way.
Thats what the problem with the cd was.
Just add it here and there, not every other word.
To fans fo Throwdown, please do complain.
This cd is alright, but the swearing was so stupid and out of place.
The problem I had was the swearing.
It sounded like they tried to damn hard to impress the youth by doing this.
It seemed like every other word in the songs are F$%*.
The cd held nothing speical at all, not what I really wanted to hear in a metal cd.
Thats what I meant to say, the swearing just seemed random and out of place.
I cant really explain to well I guess, but i'll try.
I usually dont have a problem with swearing, but the way this band did it ruined the cd.
If you want really inspiring music go and listen to a Hatebreed cd.
I listened to cd and I dont know how to explain this cd.
HA!
Everyone has an opinion and that is mine.

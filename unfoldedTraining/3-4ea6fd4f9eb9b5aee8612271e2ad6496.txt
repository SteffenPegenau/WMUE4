Mark sells drugs and is turned in by Bryon.
I would recommend this book to anyone who has read The Outsiders.
It's a spin off of this wonderful novel.
I enjoyed the book, but not as well as The Outsiders.
This book however, is slow moving.
The book That Was Then This Is Now is a realistic fiction story.
It is a story based off of choices.
It has excitement, but it is slow to reaching its climax.
Mark and Bryon who onced loved each other hate each other in the end.
A friend of yours is killed because of your life style.
They grow up together hustling pool and street fighting.
A friend Charlie dies during a street fight, Bryon then turns his life around.
Mark then goes to prison.
It relates to everyone; we all have a choice how we choose to live our lives.
Do you continue to live like that or change?Mark and Bryon are like brothers.

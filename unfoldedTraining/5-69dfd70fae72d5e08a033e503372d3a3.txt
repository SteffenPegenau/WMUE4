Don't read other reviews, just rent this.
Enjoy.
If you haven't seen this movie yet, please go rent it today.
This was one of my first Eastwood movies as an actor I've ever seen.
I didn't look away for a second.
That should tell you something in it's self.
The rest of the 123 reviews are four stars and above.
Within five or so minutes I was already hooked to Eastwoods character and the film.
Tell your friends and don't sit around, rent it today.
The film is not a comedy but there were many funny moments.
I'm happy I picked this up.
The film should not bore anybody.
Everybody needs to see this movie.

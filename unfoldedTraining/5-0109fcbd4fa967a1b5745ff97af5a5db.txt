Less moving parts means less to break.
I love it.
If someone shows up unexpected, they call me and I give them the code.
Also means less battery usage.
The most vulnerable part of this from my reasearch was the motor that drives the deadbolt into the wall.
BEST FEATURE IS THAT IT HAS NO MOTOR TO PUSH THE DEADBOLT IN THE WALL.
Looks like it could survive the weather anyway.
Easy to delete and change.
They solved that problem in this model by creating a hand turn on the front of the lock.
No need to leave a key for the kids, bug man, or maid.
I've seen some negative comments about it, but mine is far under my porch and in no threat of getting wet.
It's great.
Enter the code than turn it.
Was worth the extra dollars to get a good sturdy reliable one.
Action feels strong and durable.
I got to say this thing works beyond my expectations.
It works by hand turning it.

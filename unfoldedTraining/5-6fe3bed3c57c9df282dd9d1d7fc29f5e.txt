I don't see how they could have made this book any better!!
Sometimes when I read a book about a series sometimes the characters don't sound like themselves.
I wished this could have been a episode.
I have more appreciation for this character now.
I have read some Star Wars books like this.
It filled me in on Janeway's life and why she is the way she is.
To her introduction to Data, to her blind date with William Riker, to how she knew Tom paris's father, Her first meeting with Tuvok(she didn't like him much at first), to her relationship with Mark,to her greatest tragedy.
It would have fit right in!
I'm glad I did.
I'm a Janeway fan so when I read some reviews about this book I just had to get it.
!
This book was a page turner and I didn't want to put it down until I had read it all.
If you are a Captain Janeway fan there is no doubt about it you will love this book.
Captain Janeway is one strong woman!
In this book though the characters sound just like they are in the series.

This kind of marketing BS STINKS!
Pick another name for the band/project and get after it.
I wish you the best.
Again, if you are into it, great.
This sounds like some kind of alternative/new age thing.
Whats next?
I don't recognize the sound on this album AT ALL except for some of Tom's guitar style.
Maybe Sting will record some Gregorian chants and call it a new Police album.
I've been a Boston fan since the mid 70's.
Hey, you may like this or you may not, but it is NOT Boston.
If this is where Tom and Brad are at these days, good for them.
George Lynch tried to market a rap album as Lynch Mob a few years ago.
But again, this has nothing to do with the Boston that I grew up listening to and it is a complete rip off to market this as a Boston album.
Keep your money and keep listening to the first 3 Boston albums.
It really irritates me that they would serve up this stuff under the name of a band that started almost 30 years ago as a ROCK band.

Either way Jason will go down as the biggest horror icn of all time.
The movies aren't that great either.
Its like the writers weren't even trying after part 3.
Not cool Paramount.
Maybe if they throw in a free tee shirt you can consider on buying this poor collectors edition.
This kind of seems like a half ass job from paramount.
I don't know whether to be excited or be dissapoited with this box set.
That was the worse one by far.
There will only be 4 discs to it and no deletes scenes or unrated editions to the movie.
Maybe Paramount should wait another ten years to release it.
It got pretty lame.
Should you buy it?
You either love the series or hate the series.
It always has the same plot.Teens go camping.
1-3 are okay but after that it kind of gets ridiculous.Jason and Manhattan come on.I rather wach Gigli than that movie.Or better yet even the house of the dead than that movie.
Teens have sex and then teens die because they had sex.

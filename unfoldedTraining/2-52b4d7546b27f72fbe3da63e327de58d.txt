I have many movies that are absolute trash but I love this.
Bad graphics don't bother me.
100% true.The beginning is interesting, hence the 2 stars.
I really do.
But by the end of the movie, especially the absolutely horrible ending, Just...For goodness sakes don't buy this movie.
What can be so wrong?"
I love monster movies so this was the reason I bought the 20 horror dvds because I saw a movie about Loch Ness on it...booooooy was I wrong.
Hell, I'll give Bruce Campbell a good rating for his bad movies.
The people are believable, there's a monster, the environment is believable.
I bought a pack of 20 horror movies and this was on it.
Please just take the time to read this.I love crappy movies.
But this movie...wow.
PLEASE.
Sometimes I don't understand why some movies have bad ratings, but this one....WOW.
You really are like, "Okay, I don't see why this is going to be a bad movie.
Just...aweful.

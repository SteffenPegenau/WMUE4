Trust me, you will be much happier than you will be with this pan.
Nothing will ever stick to the Griswald unless you REALLY try.
Buy yourself a good Griswald pan on eBay.
Several friends who have seen or used my pans have commented how they think it is coated with teflon, but it's not.
I grew up with a father who collected old Griswald cast iron pans.
I bought this pan and have stuck it in the back of the closet, never to be used.
This causes foods like eggs and anything with a sauce to get stuck in the muck.
They are super smooth on the interior.
They are the ideal pan.
After each use, wipe it out with a paper towel and leave it alone.
I now have a nice collection of Griswald pans.
Lodge makes their products with a gritty, rough surface.
I'm a huge fan of cast iron.
Unfortunately, Lodge could be a lot better than it is.
There is no reason for this.

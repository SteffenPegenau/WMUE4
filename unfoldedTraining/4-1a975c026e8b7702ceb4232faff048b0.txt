I put this in a 2001 camry, and it made a big difference.
This is not a job to do when it is ten degrees outside.
Wait till spring or summer when the Dynamat is easier to work with.
Cut it too big?
Then just roll over it with a roller of some kind to make sure it grips.
It was like I was driving a different car I did the hood, doors, floor, and later I tried doing the trunk but did not have enough to finish it.
Cut it with a utility knife, remove the backing, and put it down.
Cut it too small?
It's no wonder Jay Leno and other serious car restorers use this stuff.
Just cut some more away.
Even if you make a mistake cutting, it hardly matters.
Getting the bulk pack is the way to go - much cheaper in the long run.
Actually installing it is a breeze.
For tricky shapes, I used paper or cardboard templates.
Just add some more.
Depending on the car you're working on, disassembly could take some time, but it's worth it.
It works!

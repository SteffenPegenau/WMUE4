Did the movie suck me into the story?5 (out of 10).
Is this movie worth seeing/renting?1 (out of 10).
I enjoyed the animation, even though I am not an amination fan per se, but probably wouldn't watch it again.If you must buy this, consider the 3 movie pack for under $20 available on Amazon.
This animated version of the Chronicles of Riddick was a nice go between movie, but really wasn't necessary to fill in the gaps between Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick.
Must buy.
Special effects.
Is this movie a must buy/purchase?
Immersion.
Intangibles.
A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.2 (out of 10).
Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks?
It is a great deal and packs all 3 movies and all the commentaries.Total Score (out of 100) = 5134 (out of 50).
Enjoyment.

As one who is about as pro-Bush as Michael Moore, I thought I would really enjoy this book.
This makes for very slow reading.
I am only a little more than halfway through so I may be rushing to judgment.
Maybe it's me.
Today, I am in bed with a bad cold so I might get more read.
I was wrong.
Maybe if I force myself.
I have about 10-12 unread books I want to get to.
When I find a book I consider interesting I put off the other things - except work, of course.
I am one of those readers who squeezes reading books in between working, reading news mags and papers, and watching sports on TV.
As I said, maybe it's me.
The last book I quit halfway through was The Hunting of the President but I may go back.
This means I am only doing a few pages a day.
I almost wish I could quit in the middle but that might be doing the author a disservice.
It is far too detailed for my taste.

To anyone who is thinking about a good book, this is one of the best that I have read in a long time!
I love Austyn!
The whole first half of the book I was laughing out loud!!!
While a bit suspicious, he is such a great hero!
Anyhow, this book is just so great!!!
Holly was a great heroine!
I truly hope that Carey gets his own book soon!
Alot of people were so bent about the whole him locking Holly in the tower thing.
I loved how she wasnt afraid of Austyn one bit!
It was so funny at parts and at other times it was so heart wrenching!
She certainly has a way with words.
I have just over the past year or so picked up Teresa Medeiros books, but, after this one, she is my new favorite!
This sort of thing more than likely did happen back in the day as Welsh people are known to be superstitious.
He was such an excellent secondary character!
I felt so many emotions reading this book, and that is what I look for!
It just didnt bother me all that much.

Even after a few weeks for my face to get used to it, it still pinched me - not every time but every couple of times.
Yes I knew this going in.
Especially on my neck.
And the charge lasted longer than the 20 shaves they said it would.
In order of importance:It doesn't shave as well.
The popup trimmer facing the right direction helped with the neck a little, but not a lot.
I used it for a month and sent it back.
This shave was OK but not as good as the Norelco.It pinches.
Neither shaver gives as good a shave as a real blade.
The Norelco was more comfortable on my face.It's loud.
I bought this after using a cheap Norelco rotary shaver which eventually needed a new head.
That cost $30.
I figures I'd spend a little more and get this one which was rated #2 by consumer reports.
If that were the only problem it would be no problem.On the positive - it is convenient like any electric.
Why?

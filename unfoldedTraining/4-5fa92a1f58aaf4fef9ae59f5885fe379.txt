And the overdubs are out of place.
It is a wild and magical trip complete with an occasional Hungarian guttural.
Let's say he is to Hendrix or Smith as Scriabin is to Brahms.
Then place in a recording studio in 1966 with a producer with the courage and deep pockets to let the music happen largely unplanned.
BUT Spellbinder and Gypsies Queen are well worth the price of admission, and most of the other tunes are very moving as well.
It really is disarmingly silly.
Relax.
Let it happen.
I have to say that I can easily forgive the vocal because it is so charming.
No, Gabor Szabo is not Jimi Hendrix or Johnny Smith.
This is one of the most enjoyable, spontaneous and heartfelt guitar albums of the 60s.
Now add a touch of genius and a sprinkling of bad taste and you have Spellbinder.
Take the trip.
Take a Latin rhythm section and add a Hungarian immigrant with formal musical training and a love of Jazz and Gypsies.
Close your eyes.

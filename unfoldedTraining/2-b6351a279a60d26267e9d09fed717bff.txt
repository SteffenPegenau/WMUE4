I read Da Vinci code and enjoyed it, mostly because of the subject matter.
However, I couldn't care less about this mystery.
And therefore I was left with his characters, who are cookie cutter and uninteresting.
He lost me from the very beginning.
Langdon is a boring man.
I read about how Mr. Brown wants to write another "Langdon" book, and I wonder what makes it a Langdon book?
The name?
The use of symbols?
He has no real flaws or quirks.
His plots better be riveting, otherwise I'm lost.
In the rush of the mystery, I overlooked the fact that I didn't really care about any of the characters.
Because knowing it's a Langdon book doesn't excite me.
He could call the guy whatever he wants and I wouldn't even notice he'd changed the name.
So I picked up this book, looking for a similar rush.
He's just some guy.
Mr. Brown painted a vivid picture of an ancient puzzle I couldn't wait to see solved.

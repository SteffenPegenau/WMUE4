For the sake of Hip Hop please stop singing.
Only certain people like Bone, and people who's voices can be fixed with the modern day studio technology can sing.
It was.....Until Ja got on the mic.
Ot's official.
If he want a singer, he should go out and sign a singer from the streets to his label.
After that song with Pac, Ja just lost a lot of cool points with me.
Ja Rule went soft.
Ja, give up on the singing.
I couldn't take it.
That's the word.
I thought the song with Tupac was going to be hott.
If this album were more like the Venni Vetti Veche album, it would be ok.
Those songs are garbage.
Please~!!
But he went soft.
Ja trying to sing really messes it up a lot.
Throw it out.
Completely tryna be like Pac.
It had a few good beats on there and Tupac was nice as usual on it.

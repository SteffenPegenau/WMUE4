And no one calls a present a "prezzy" without getting their ass kicked.
Prezzy?
I actually liked Claire better than the popular posers.
Ehmigod?
Personally, I would never want to read about little kids.
It got on my nerves.
I mean, a real 11 year old would find another group to hang out with.
And what was with Massie thinking a 16-year-old guy liked her?
That cracked me up.
And the characters are probably the most annoying, stupid, unrealistic, moronic characters I was ever tormented into reading about.
But still, why was she so desperate to be in their "clique"?
First of all, this book is about girls that are,um, 11 or 12 years old.
I mean, the whole time the stupid characters are just trying to act older than they really are.
My favorite part in the whole book was when she saw that 16-year-old with his wicked pretty older girlfriend.
It's so pointless.
Okay.

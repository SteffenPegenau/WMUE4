I regret it even more.
I remember the "IBM-Big Brother" SuperBowl ad way back when.
Incompatibilities among its own products.
I bought my son a Creative Labs Zen 30GB (under $200) and my daughter the Nano ($149, it's what she wanted).
Apple has ripped customers off for 20 years.
The Nano is a dog.
Don't waste your $$ on a proprietary system like iPod, no matter how "hip" it is.
Converting them is a bear and waste of time.
The less expensive music sites (e.g., Walmart) don't offer iPod-format tunes.
Turns out Apple is Big Brother.
I can buy and download music from almost anywhere for the Zen - no problem.
Doesn't play nice with other hardware and software.
Fixes prices (ever see an iPod discounted?).
Can't wait for the Feds to investigate - one of these days.
I wish I'd bought two Zens -- there's a great product.
When the two arrived, she regretted her choice.
Locks customers into proprietary formats.

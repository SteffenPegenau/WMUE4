Blah.
Then the whole book went south.The Rest of the book is about Derek's desire to have sex with Chantelle.
Everything was great until the hero and heroine met.
(Where I come from that's called emotional rape.)
He's manipulative, selfish, and pretty much 'seduces' her into the sex.
The characters were fun and the settings were interesting.
He doesn't know anything about her and doesn't seem to care.
I won't make the mistake of reading another Johanna Lindsey book.
Frankly, I thought Chantelle would have been better off with one of the eunuchs.But of course he falls in love with her (falls in love with having sex, because they never have a conversation about anything else.
And the sex is his only desire.
and it all works out.
I loved the first 150 pages of this book.
I ended up hating him, and not understanding why she loved him.
How can you love a complete stranger?)
He never even asks what her real name is, although he insists that she use his real name.

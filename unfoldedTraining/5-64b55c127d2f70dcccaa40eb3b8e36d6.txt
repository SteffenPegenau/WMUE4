Please get this, and support the sales so they might re-release this show on broadway.
He is Great.

Viva Jekyll and Hyde.

Linda Edner is AMAZING.
I wish I could have seen this show.

First off, let me tell you that I have not listened to the other "Jekyll and Hyde" recordings all the way through.

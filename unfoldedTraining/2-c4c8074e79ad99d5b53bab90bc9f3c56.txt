Of course, this is my opinion, since I like heavier music.
I read online that this album was going to be heavier than Lateralus.
I have loved Tool since there first album.
Just my opinion.
Sad to say, this album is anything but heavy.
The other songs are long, slow, and boring.
I was very excited when I heard this and looked forward to the new album.
I wanted to like this album as much as anyone else, but I just can't.
Half of the album is soundscapes and instrumental.
2 songs on the whole album.
Lateralus, to me, was a huge let down.
Very long and boring, except for Schism, Ticks and Leeches, The Grudge.
It seems to me that since the birth of A Perfect Circle, the aggressive and dynamic sound of Tool as slowly dwindled away.
I guess all the qualities I loved about Tool in their first 3 albums are no more.
Don't get me wrong, I do like Vicarious and Jambi, but that's it.
Sad but true.

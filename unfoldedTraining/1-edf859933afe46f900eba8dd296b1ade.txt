Well this is a farcry form any good game.
It is going where this evil resident belongs, in the trash.
With all the hype and movie and all, I said wow what only $20.
This game is so bad that even with all the patches It is not going in my used game box.
This from the makers of Farcry.
Wow, they got me!
And I was lucky enough to have a game pad.
It is evil!!!
Don't bother buying one for this game.
Shame on Ubisoft and Capcom for this piece of Junk.
Then you will be out $40 for this.
I can live with that.
This game in not meant to be played on PC.
They did a good job with Halo but these guys don't have a clue on how to bring a console game to PC.
I figured it would be one of those $49 games.
Some of my Valusoft games are way better than this.
It is not even worth the one star I gave it.
I saw Ubisoft a name I could trust.

Maria Ewing as Cherubino looked young enough to pass for 15.
The one fault is that at times it seemed that the focus was not as sharp as it should have been.
Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau could really put a smirk on his face.
Mirella Freni as Susanna.
None of them were the "over aged over upholstered" figures of some other versions.
Do not confuse me with an authority on opera, but Wow.
Kiri Te Kanawa as the Comtessa.
This is not a stage production.
I am so pleased with this.
The colors were good.
Hermann Prey as Figaro.
All the leads apparent ages were believable.
The costuming seemed accurate.
Janet Perry as Barbarina.
I love the leads.
It seemed to have been filmed in a studio, but it is an opera.
(I especially dislike the overly full tightly corseted figures of some soprano's).

Insanely awsome stout Irish music!
I have burned copy but I like it so much that I'm gonna buy the album.
Now.
I highly recommend recommending this to other people too.
I used to be a fluent rap fan until I heard this and now I'm a fluent Amadan fan.
This band is seriously good enough to make it to the next Woodstock or something like that.
This is how Irish rock/punk music was meant to be made.
My brothers girlfriend knows one of the members and that's how I found out, so I'm telling you.
This is the best CD ever.
Buy this.
Seriously.
It doesn't even matter what you listen to to enjoy it.
!
We just had to wait a while for it to come out.
If yes then gooood, if no, then do it.
Now.
Are you clicking buy...?

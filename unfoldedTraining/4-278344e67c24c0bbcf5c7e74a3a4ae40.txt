The only bad thing is that after I purchase this for $249, the price went down to about $150 and new version came out.
Bummer.
May have to hand it down to my husband and buy me the newer version.
I LOVE this thing!
Anyway, even with drawbacks I still love it!
Convenience is basic.
Specific things I don't like so much: Can't get my arms around the bookmarks.
Pictures are not clear.
Also tried some kids books on it, but not good for those.
It seems I set a bookmark and then can't figure out how to get back to that place.
I travel a lot and hated to always tote books on plane with me.
Now I just download and slip this in my purse/bag and what convenience.
In fact graphics and diagrams are not the best viewed on Kindle.
Hey, maybe they should come up with a kindle version in color for kids!
Specific things I like: Text sizes help my aging eyes to read without glasses.

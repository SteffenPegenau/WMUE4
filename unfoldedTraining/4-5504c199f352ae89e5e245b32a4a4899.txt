It's nice to get all of their videos plus some extras.
Pick this up and check out "Axis of Justice"(Maynard does some work with them).
The commentary on the video is a nice touch and helps give a unique perspective into the filming process.
I don't know where this stuff came from nor do I care to know.
I prefer the originals but it's fun to hear them from a different prespective.
"Thinking of you" is a great song that could of had a creative video.
It was also nice to see some live footage and to see the film contestants work.
More Bikini Bandits.
The main strike I have against it is the "Bikini Bandits" stuff.
The CD was pretty cool.
with that aside.
What do we get?
I've never been a fan of remix albums but this was tolerable.
This DVD isn't bad.
They have no place on this DVD.
The Bikini Bandits are a separate entity from A Perfect Circle and should be treated as such.

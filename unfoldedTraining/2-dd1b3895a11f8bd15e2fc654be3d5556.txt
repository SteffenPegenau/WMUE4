Don't get me wrong.
Sorry, it's the truth.
I honestly can't figure out what the big deal is.
I just can't find something to like.Hail to the Theif... boring.
My take on the matter.
Mediocre at best.
I can't figure it out.OK Computer was a terrific album.
I'm interested in good rock music.
It was enjoyable.
Radiohead is one of the most heralded bands on the planet, if not THE #1 Rock band.
It was different.
Why?
But everything else Radiohead has done just bores me to death.
I take recommendations, such as these on Amazon, and I make CD selections based on hype.
Radiohead has done this all before, and it's just making me Yawn this time around.
I can't.
I've found myself listening to their albums, especially this one, over and over again, trying to find something I like.
There is not one song on the album that fully captures my attention.
I'm not coming on here to bash Radiohead beacuse I don't like them, and I have something against them.

Maybe Picard has been in space too long.
Surely Star Fleet Engineers could come up with something more dignified.
This was hard to image him doing.Worf with a pimple?
!
What will they think of next?My kids were delighted to think Nintendo would be around in the 24th century!
Riker being shaved by Troi?
The most absurd part was Riker steering the Enterprise with a "joy stick"!
There were too many "cutesy" things in this movie.
A "Nintendo" Enterprise!!
Really!!
How come Picard never gets the girl?
Trying to play footsey on her couch?
Worf being a warrior would rather kill himself then show this "childish" side of himself.
Data singing?
Any female that shows him any attraction he rejects harshly!

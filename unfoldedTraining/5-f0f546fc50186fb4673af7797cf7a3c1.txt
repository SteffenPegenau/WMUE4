The Omega litter mat does not do much good, so you really don't need it.
Built great, no problems with lid.
It is so easy to clean.
Cat loves the privacy.
I am really suprised that every single pet store doesn't carry this great item.
Makes life so much easier.
This is great and highly recomended.
We have this in our large bathroom.
Ended up ordering online.
Have been using for about two months now.
You will LOVE this.
Cat loves to use the drawer handle to rub against.
Just roll over and empty drawer.
I am in the Orlando area and I searched every pet store, could not find it anywhere.
A plain old bath mat or rug works best with the litter tracking.

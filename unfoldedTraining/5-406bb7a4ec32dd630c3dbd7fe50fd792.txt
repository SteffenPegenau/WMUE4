You can't really compare to their first album.
Good Drums--tight.
Pick them up.
Just buy both fr yourself from good old Amazon.com and see for yourself.
Mature lrics, and a lot of break downs.
It's the best song.
Just good old emo.
It's acually cheaper online than at Sam Goody's and F.Y.E.
There's nothing left to say except that they have talent and now are starting to hit it big.
The lead singer has a good voice.
Sad music, catchy guitars exspecially in #5.
The guitars are modern but great.
very little punk here.
Second album from Brand New.
good electric and then an acoustic-#11.

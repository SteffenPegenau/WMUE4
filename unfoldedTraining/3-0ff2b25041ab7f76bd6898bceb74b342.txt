They do not want to burrow in it at all.
THAT DOES HAPPEN AND THE FLAP DOES NOT STAY UP THAT WELL.I would not recommend this dog bed.
It is not made of good quality.
AFTER HAVING THIS BED FOR AWHILE I STARTED NOTICING THAT MY DOG DOES LIKE IT.
ESPECIALLY MY LITTLE CHIHUAHUA.
I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BED FOR SMALL DOGS DEFINITELY.
It is not cozy and my pets just don't like it.
My little dog eats the fluff in it and won't get in it.
I cannot return a dog bed for sanitary reasons but buyer beware.
That is a waste.
Get one that is flatter and does not have that overlap on it.
I WOULD LIKE TO REVISE MY REVIEW.
Sorry but don't buy.
BUT WATCH FOR THEM EATING THE FUR.
It's too high to step in and it rocks from side to side.
My animals did not take to it and I have a 4 pound dog that DOES NOT EVEN LIKE THIS BED.
I wish I had gotten another one instead.
It simply does not work right like it is described.

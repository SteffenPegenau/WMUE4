Something about it is fun to watch.
Yes, it is lame.
Enjoy this guilty pleasure without the guilt.
It's sooo bad that it is good.
It knows it ain't no "Grease" and makes no apologies.
It still manages to entertain and that is what is important.
It accepts itself for what it is, so why can't we?
You've earned it.
But we all knew that Michelle would rise from the ashes of this bomb and be a star.
It's good at being bad.
Lets give G2 a break.
"Cool Rider," "Reproduction," "Who's That Guy," any of these sound familiar?
It's like a train wreck that must be watched, over and over again.
The plot is rehashed, reversed from the first one.
It never tries to rise above itself and that's noble.

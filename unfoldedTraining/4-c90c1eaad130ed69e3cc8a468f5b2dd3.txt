This film is one of a kind.
The love story is not the focus of the movie.
This movie is a very well-crafted, well-directed, and well-acted wake-up call, a valuable education, and good story.
Scenery is breathtaking.
"Beyond Borders" spans three war-torn, third-world countries.
It is simply used to connect the settings.
I find it difficult to understand how some people could watch this movie and not be moved.
Great job!
You leave the movie feeling lucky that you have a home and food, and wonder how you can help those who are less fortunate.
This is a five-star movie in my opinion simply because you leave wondering how you can help.
The focus of the movie is the men, women and children displaced by war and famine across the world.
It is an attempt to spotlight an issue that most of us do not think about, but which we should.
The humanitarian effort is valiant and endearing.
Deeply moving and inspiring.
Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen were fantastic.

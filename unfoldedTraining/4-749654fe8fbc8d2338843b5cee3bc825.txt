Are these meant to replace the original singles?
But Tom Moulton did it.
Yes, some of them can be jarring, because we're so accustomed to hearing them in that flat, "AM radio" kind of sound.
I have both.
I play both.
The packaging on this is also really good.
As others have stated, these are not the original mono single mixes.
Keeping in mind that those final mono mixdowns were the reason for the creation of the multitracks used to also create these stereo versions, it should be easy to appreciate that there were a lot of limitations in creating great-sounding stereo from them.
This collection features stereo versions (many newly mixed expressly for this set) of many familiar (maybe overly familiar) classics.
Yes.
Those are available in a different box set.
I'm glad that both exist.
It would have gotten five stars except for the skimpy content on disc four.
No.
Are these great on their own merits?

A truely disappointing movie.
I didn't know evil could be so boring.
And Burt Reynolds was in it.
No blood splattering here.
But maybe it was because I got the uncut, director's version; it was way too long.
I expect battle scenes that involve swords, axes, and arrows to be more gruesome.
Ray Liota as the bad guy?
But I did.
All told, not a movie I'd buy.
I thought I couldn't go wrong with a Jason Statham action movie, but I was.
Well, he could have been.
The king's nephew was Shaggy from Scooby Doo (hey, I've got kids), which was just weird.
The story was a little confusing, but that could be do to me dozing off at various points.
I thought he was dead.
Curses!
The Krugs looked rather lame and they didn't give us an understanding of them.

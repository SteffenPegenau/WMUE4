A great read for anyone.
They were way cool in the book.
Really.
In the book, Tolkien might spend 40 pages on some boring walk, including every detail of what they ate, what the trees looked like.
But definitely start with the Hobbit.
I totally loved the Hobbit, maybe because I didn't see the movie (is there one?).
I kind of did this backwards...I saw the movies before I read the book.
But then he describes an epic battle scene in like 2 pages.
Even though it dragged sometimes, I read every word 'cause I liked it so much.
All great stuff, in small chunks.
I mean the world in Lord of the Rings is so creative and interesting...like the Ents, as an example.
The three Lord of the Rings books were really good, but man, they got boring sometimes.
Sure.
I mean, I think the movies actually improved on stuff, which is rare.
That's the best of them all.
That's supposed to be what everything else is leading up to.But that's about all I have to complain about.

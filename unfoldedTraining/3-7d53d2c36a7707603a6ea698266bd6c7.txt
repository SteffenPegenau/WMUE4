I used to think folk were whingers and whiners who bagged re-issues.
I'm not kidding.
You will agree with me!
Sadly it is at us$175.00 as I write this review for new.
I know I will stock up on a few at US$5 each because it is my most played Stones post-Decca CD.
Surely with superior new technology the most recent version would be the best, I reasoned.
Having read the reviews imploring me to get hold of Virgin 1994, I returned to the dust encrusted CD sitting on my shelf.
I will never dismiss naysayers as misery guts ever again!
Oh WOW!
Basically a deaf person could hear how far superior the 1994 Virgin release sounds with far better realised bass.
Unfortunately, it was shrill and compressed beyond belief.
The "Some Girls" Deluxe Edition arrived and I put the disk on expecting a sonic orgasm.
It is blatantly obvious!
Get second hand.
Take care Y'all.

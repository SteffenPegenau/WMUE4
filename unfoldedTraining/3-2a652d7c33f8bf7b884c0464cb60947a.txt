Now im not trying to discourage you.
I'm an avid mountain biker.
Now i belive that no matter how much you spend on a full face helmat its worth it.
Yes these types of helmats make you feel indestructable.
Just last firday I crashed into a black berry bush going 30 mph+.
Full face helmats are the best thing to hit the biking world.
Without it i probaly wouldnt be here.
My helmat has saved my face so many times I cannot keep track.
I own a full face helmat similar to this.
I have had mine for about 3 years.
And i love it to death.
But just make sure the helmat you choose has room for you to breath and pleanty of air hole in the top.
I try to trail ride 4 to 5 days a week.
THe hot air that comes out goes straigh into your face (because of the mouth gaurd) or right into the top ot the helmat.
But they get outragously HOT.
My only complaint/ sugestion, is that it depends on how much and how hard your ride your bike.

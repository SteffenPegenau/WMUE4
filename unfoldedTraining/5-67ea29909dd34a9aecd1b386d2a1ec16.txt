Only Snoop could come up with a title so creative.
This album put Snoop back on the map musically in my opinion.
Thereafter he only gave you a few singles, but this one was really nice.
Dr. Dre has helped Snoop once again.
I especially like the track with Stevie Wonder, Nate Dogg, Dr. Dre, and I also love Vato.
This is one of Snoop's best CD's in a long time, fo' shizzle my nizzle, you can't beat the Snoop D.O.
LOL
double gizzle.
To title this CD Blue Carpet treatment shows just how smooth Snoop Dogg is.
The beats on this CD flows with his smooth voice.
I could play this CD all the way through without skipping a track.
His prior CD's after his first initial CD were weak.
I was in California when this single was released and they were playing it at every beach.
Blue is also my favorite color.
Blue is cool.
Blue Carpet treatment is better than your typical hollywood red carpet treatment.

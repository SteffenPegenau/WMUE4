I find sometimes horror movies with unknown actors are better..So the beginning is good.
I dont wanna give away too much but she's just stupid the second time she puts up with it..and WHY on earth didn't she tell her friends!!!!!!!
I spent 5 bucks renting this and I wish I had waiting for it to be on HBO.
Ok so I was excited to see this movie..
You should all just wait.
So the whole egg scene is bizzare.
see no evil is a better flick!
I thought wow a good actress is in it.. That's a bad sign..
The blonde leader kid is good.
BUT then it starts getting DUMB.
Creepy.
CMON!Then I also thought she has knives in the kitchen she couldve grabbed one quick and sliced the guys!
I was dissapointed.
BUT NOOOOOOOO............Overall..
The ending was UGH..

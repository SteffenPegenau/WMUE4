And his characters!
Kimball is the master of the plot twist.
My advice?
My only complaint is that I am so tired because I stayed up most of the night wanting to finish it.
!
Well, don't!
But it was worth getting exhausted!
I loved Michael Kimball's UNDONE, his second book, because it was a real page-turner.
But don't open it until you've got a few days' worth of meals ready to put on the table and you are all caught up with the laundry so you won't have your reading interrupted by such mundane chores such as meal preparation, folding clothes, etc.
(I can't say more without ruining the story for you!)
I think Kimball plays on the reader's willingness to believe in the inate goodness of people.
I can guarantee you will not know what is going to happen until the very end.
Get the book!
So I was excited to pick up MOUTH TO MOUTH!
(Funny how I didn't notice how tired I was when I was reading it!)

It was definetly better then the first half but not by much.
I figured it would be good, I have read her under Laura Renken, but this writing was terrible.
Weird.
It was also really confusing.
!
I cant even use the right word to describe him.
The end had some ok parts.
I really did not like Ryan.
I did not like either main character, Christopher was a jerk, Alexandra let him walk all over her, Lord Ware was not likeable either.
I might get the second book, I might not.
Love scences were rushed and not all that great anyway.
Read at your own risk!
Im really not sure what to make of this book.
For the most part, the first half of the book was really bad.
All over the place.
Nothing like LR.
I really did not care for this book, I thought I would like it.
I will definetly read all reviews before hand if I do decide to read it, even then, I might get it from the library.

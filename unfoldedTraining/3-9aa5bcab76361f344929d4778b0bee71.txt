So I'm a big fan of Rock Star Energy Drinks .
.
...
.Well .
.
.
Because it pumps me up AND it tastes wonderful.
.I'm a big fan of the Original Rock Star Energy Drink (Citrus-flavored).
.
.Let me specify .
Yes .
.So,unless you REALLY need the energy, I'd suggest sticking to the original .
This, Double-Energy crud, may pump me up even more (which is not exactly the best thing when I'm just about to go to class),but it tastes awful .
.It tastes like that horrible cough medicine that was given to you as a kid.
It's THAT bad .
.
.
Why?

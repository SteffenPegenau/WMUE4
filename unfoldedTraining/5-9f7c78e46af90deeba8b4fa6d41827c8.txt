They claim it's like watching tv!
No escapes easily made as the lid takes a little bit to open.
Our ants just arrived yesterday and they have already dug 3 tunnels!
This farm was smaller than my household toaster.
What a great tone to that claim, right?
So happy about that.
It's very durable and sturdy.
My kids sit at the breakfast table each morning, snatch up the farm and sit and watch it while they eat their breakfast.
It was MUCH smaller than I thought but that's because I didn't really look at the dimensions.
This really has a good sealed lid!
!
It's SO neat to watch them.
This really is a great overall product and if they offered these in bigger sizes I'd buy them!
This farm really puts the sand farms to shame.
Which is nice but I think my husband was hoping to have something atleast 2-3 times the size.
I don't want a flimsy farm and this is NOT.

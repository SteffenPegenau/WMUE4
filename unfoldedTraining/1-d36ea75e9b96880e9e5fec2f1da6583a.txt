Two weeks, it stops working.
Once I got the new cleaner, it was broken.
I thought that welding spots were done very cheap.
Called the company and sent the computer to warehouse.
I lost more time in these exchanges than sleeplessness due to my roommates smoking.
I could not change it, could not turn it off.
But I will blame UPS for rough shipping and handling.
I lost money.
Returned and got the third cleaner.
All four welding spots that hold the fan in the center were broken and the fan was floating free.
Back then I was a second year medicals student.
and swore to never buy Holms products again.
I was moving my apartment, thus I decided to toss it in trash.
Bought this cleaner and was happily using it.
Till one day (2 months later) it was stuck on low.

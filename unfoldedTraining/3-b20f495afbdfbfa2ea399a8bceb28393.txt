As far as learning from this DVD as a beginner...it's not as easy as I remembered.
I found a VHS copy of this about 9 years ago.
The production is about the same.
Not the best.
It was the 80's!
It's just not the most professional quality either.
Not the best, but not the worst i've seen either.
history, basic moves, veil work, finger cymbals, costuming (80's style though) and performances.CONS: She doesn't really verbally explain what she is doing very well.
Maybe I'm just stiffer at the age of 23 then I was at 14...Overall this DVD is okay.
They did the best they could!Not bad, but not my first choice.
I have a harder time following her moves now than I used to.
It really inspired me to bellydance.PROS:This DVD is cool because it covers a little bit of everything.
But not terrible either.
It doesn't look like someone took a home video in the garage or anything like that.
HEY!

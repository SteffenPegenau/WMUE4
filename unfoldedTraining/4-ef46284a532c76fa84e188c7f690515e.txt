I don't have a use for anything larger.
Best shot selector shoots up to 10 still images then saves the sharpest.
The camera did have a little trouble locking foucus in macro mode when subject(flower) did not fill image area.
The camera can make a copy your pictures in a lower resolution.
Nice for intances where you can't use flash or can't see the LCD screen.
This is a feature packed little camera.
I'm quite happy with the image quality of a printed 8x10.
1 inch or 1 foot when zoomed.
Just select the smaller size and the image is ready for email.
The macro setting can shoot incredibly close.
Focused great otherwise.
I liked the cameras small size.
I found a couple of the features very useful.
I found the 3X zoom a bit small, maximum focal length is 14.1mm I've seen 2X cameras with more magnification.
The flip of that is the wide angle is real wide.
I will use this camera for quick shots when I don't want lug out the SLR.

This is still a good cd and shouldn't be looked by.
The song was blazin hot.
Featuring;Ice Cube, Mack 10 , Ca$h Money, Eminem, KuRupt, Frost,Krayzie &Bizzy Bone,Jarule feat.Vita and more.
But the first Soundtrack was better than this one I have to admit.
You Can Do It with Ice Cube Mack 10 and Ms. Toi was a good song on this album.
This was a cool soundtrack fulled with a various amount of artists.
Snoop and the best song on the album titled Chin Check.
This was a cool album for any hip hop fan.
It's worth buying.
And this album was also the return of the biggest rap group ever.
NO LIMIT 2000
Peace out.
All the artist had pretty good songs on this album.
Mamacita featuring Kurupt and more was anothjer tight song to check out.
The NWA feat.

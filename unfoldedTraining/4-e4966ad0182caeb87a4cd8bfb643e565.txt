I highly recommended it to my friends.
I also use it when I wax my floor.
I am very satisfied with this item.
I usually use 2-3 Chlorox pads to clean my floor.
It took me days to figure out which button to push when you want the scrubber or the pad.
In fact, I let them use it in their apartments.
At the last pad, I could hardly see any dirt.
Easy to follow instructions on the assembly of this product.
It's very effective in cleaning the floor.
I was hesistant to buy it at first since it's a little pricy compared to other mops.
But after a while, I find the product very useful.
Using this product has reduced the time I spent on cleaning.
But at first, I had a hard time making the mop work.
I use Chlorox pads on this mop and put drops of PineSol in the water bottle.
It is a little heavy which is good because you don't have to add pressure when you want to scrub/mop.

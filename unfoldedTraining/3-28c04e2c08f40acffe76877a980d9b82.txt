I will end my review here.
But what happens to the woman?
The placement of the deceased things are exactly where Kurt Russels character finds them later that day.
Totally worth a rental for sure.
And I was shocked.
It has all the makings of a horrible sequel.
I might actually purchase this.
Did she make it to the Russian camp?
It's not the horrible film I was expecting.
Bad Joke I know.
It would have been nice to see what the thing actually looks like in it's natural form, but I guess that is for the imagination I suppose.
But I will give credit to the director, whom obviously knows the 1982 version front and back.
It was actually pretty entertaining.
I just rented this.
Maybe they will call it "Things".
If she did make it did she have any Alien dna on her clothing?
Don't want to give too much away.

Some mediocre acting.
Also, Absentia loses some steam towards the second half; there aren't as many scares and it generally wasn't as great as the first half.If you love horror films, especially slow paced creepers, you'll most likely enjoy Absentia.
Very Creepy and OriginalI really liked Absentia.
This movie is genuinely scary!
This modern horror movie uses tension and creepy imagery to create an original vision.
I didn't expect most of the scares and got some goosebumps during others.
It didn't need gore or loud music to scare.
Some forced/poor dialogue.
And I also liked the music.What did I dislike?
I highly recommend it.Absentia has some violence and gore.
*Originally posted on DVD version
Absentia uses the slow pace to tell a fairly original story and create a tense setting.
The ending was also good.
Some may dislike the slow pacing, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.What did I like?
No sex or nudity.
If you have Netflix Streaming, it available as of 7/10/12.

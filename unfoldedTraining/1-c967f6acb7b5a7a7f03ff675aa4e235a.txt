Avoid this Barbie movie like the plague.
NOT in this movie.
Why is this movie so rotten?
That's a little mature for them.
Well...first: Kelly Sheridan is Barbie.
Children that watch Barbie, in my opinion, do not need to watch mess with boyfriends and cheating.
It's not Barbie at all.
We have all the movies.
I hate the voice of Barbie in this one.
Where did she go?
After the pleasant surprise of Mermaid Tale, I elected to buy this one, though I was as skeptical as with the Spring release.
Including this one.
As of November 25, 2010, she is not credited for any further Barbie projects, though there is a movie projected for release in Spring 2011, second: the subject matter is way too mature for the age range of this series.
If they already are exposed to it, why add to the needless drama?
Barbie is an integral part of this household.
I even looked up Ms. Sheridan on Internet Movie Database.

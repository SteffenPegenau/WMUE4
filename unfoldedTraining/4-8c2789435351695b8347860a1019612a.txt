But a good one?
Just like family and friends.
I did not give this album the five stars.
Slayer is my alternative to Sepultura.
Yes... Any loyal fan should buy this one.
Well, no.
Sepultura "sells out".
Is this a great album?
Don't get me wrong.
With the exception of "Divine Intervention" and "Undisputed Attitude", Slayer has put out great albums since "South of heaven".
You stick with them even through struggles.
Sepultura puts out the CD "against".
Slayer puts out "devil in music".
But they deserve something for keeping the Slayer sound in tact.
Slayer "keeps it real".

The lamp arrived today.
A very deep burgandy.
GE Energy Smart 3-way bulb.
Ordered the recommended light bulb to go with it.
Not sure why that was suggested to go with the lamp since I was unable to put the shade on with it in place because it was too tall for the product.
Finally.
Would have been nice to have that specified.
They do not show up so well on the picture.
However, found another place to put the Energy Star 3-way bulb.
For the price I thought it should be heavier, but I like it and therefore will keep it.
But then, I got the desk lamp and perhaps it fits the floor lamp.
Took over a week.
Do note that this shade is burgandy.
Packaged nicely and it's a lovely lamp.
Frankly, I liked them but they are not for everyone so note that the shade is not a solid color.
And note the gold scrolls on the shade.

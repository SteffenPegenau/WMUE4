BUT toward the very end of the book we hear that Wife #2 stood trial and is in jail.
Now during this trial Wife 2 would have been asked what her relationship to the piot was.
In a short comment about this book, I mentioned a fatal and sloppy flaw in the story.
I know my editor would have come down me heavily.
It boggles me how the author and editor allowed this to pass by.
And she would have replied, rightly, "his wife".
OK. Good so far.
Not good enough.
And THAT would have got out.
Or indeed anyone.
Hence Wife #1 could not have kept it a secret from her daughter.
There would be NO hiding it after that.
Sloppy and it cheats the reader terribly.
Since then a few people have sent me e mails to ask what this flaw is.
Anita Shreve is a good writer, but how she allowed this to slip past is beyond me.
I had decided not to post it here as those who had not yet read the book may be let down, but here goes: Wife #1 in America(the real wife if wou will)discovers the 2nd wife in London.

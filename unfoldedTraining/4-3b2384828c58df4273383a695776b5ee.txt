We had one piece in teh set where the pattern on the dinner plate was slightly off center, not a huge deal to us and not very obvious (my husband didn't notice until I pointed it out.
However, the description explains there are only 4 pieces per place setting.
Still fine, but misleading through the picture.
The pattern doesn't look true red in real life like it does on the picture.
It's got more muted tones of deeper maroon and pinkish hues.
I had this with my last set of dishes and liked it.
We knew what to expect from Correlle and we really like the pattern.
Viewed from a distance it's true red, up close- mostly red"ish".

The following things aren't bad, just something to be aware of (all of which I had done extra research on so I knew ahead of time)1.
Overall my family likes these dishes so far.
3.
The picture on amazon shows 5 pieces per place setting.
You get the pieces described - no "luncheon plate" as pictured.
All in all, a good value.

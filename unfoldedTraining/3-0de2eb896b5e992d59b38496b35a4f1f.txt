check it out .
pretty fair script .
i read a very favorable review in VIDEOSCOPE (the phantom of the movies) mag .
if you're an avid 24 fan , you may not be able to divorce yourself from JACK Bauer syndrome .
loads of things you've seen before but still a fun and sometimes scary afternoon .
i did enjoy the film a good bit more than i thought i would .
it's my favorite genre .
good grue .
i've seen better .
not his fault .
i've seen a lot worse .
if you have not seen much horror you'll probably think it's the cat's p.js .
he gives a solid performance here .
certainly worth a rental .
i chuckled to myself a good bit when ann was impaled on the pipe (so to speak) and an approximation of MICHAEL'S lyric sprung into my mind .
i like the director a good bit (THE HILLS HAVE EYES) remake .
it was not too insulting .
if you've seen a lot of horror you'll still be entertained .

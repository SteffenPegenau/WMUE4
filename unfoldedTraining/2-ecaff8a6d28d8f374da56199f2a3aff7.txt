Hard to catch the ball.
Very inexspensive (always a plus).
Two playfields instead of one.
Sound effects are fine but not outstanding.
The goods as I see them...The playfield is great.
The bads...You get what you've paid for.
You can play your KISS CDs while playing the game (way cool).
The layout has plenty to hit yet not crowded.
The next time KISS authorizes a static pinball simulator, they should go to Empire Interactive.
The ball plays like a pachinco machine with flippers, or the shop owner set the machine level at a 75 degree angle.
I miss the Turbo-Grafx pinball game Devils Crush....
The painting on the first playfield makes it hard to visually track the ball.
The music is not bad enough to gripe about.
I've never played the PC version by On Deck Interactive but, I've heard people talk about this game who have and apparently this version doesn't live up to the PC.
Thanks.
The flippers have a lag, as if the jets are worn.

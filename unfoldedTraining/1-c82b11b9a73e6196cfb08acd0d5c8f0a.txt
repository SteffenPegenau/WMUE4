Planning to buy iPod.
I try to email company - no response until I got nasty.
They email me to call helpline again - not good - I only use a prepaid cell phone.
Then the helpline person at PHilips told me he wouldn't advise using it!
Save your money and frustration, buy anything else.
I bought this item thinking that being a computer savy person, I wouldn't struggle with some of the issues some people said they had.
Sometimes it doesn't turn off.
Getting more expensive.
I've been able to load only one song onto it - and it's one I already had.
How many times do I want to hear one song.
None of the music would load onto my player, never has and apparently never will.
Wasted $10 to find out the software that came with it doesn't actually work with it, and so far I can't find download music software that will work with it.
I used the musicmatch software that was "highly recommended."
WRONG.
Sometimes it doesn't know it's connected to computer.

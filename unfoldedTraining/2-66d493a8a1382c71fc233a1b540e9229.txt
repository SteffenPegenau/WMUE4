I thought they were just two shades of tan from the picture.
We just received our set yesterday and put it together last night.
Even though it isn't what we expected we really love the quality and look.
It's a little on the masculine side and the size of the chairs are a bit intimidating.
A steal!
It came packed very well and with no damage.
They are VERY comfortable though.
(At 5"5" when my back is to the back of the chair my feet don't touch the floor.)
Aside from the color differences, I would definately recommend this set.
However, it is not the color we expected.
It is a beautiful, well put together, timless piece.
The cushions are a tan and sage green pattern with a little bit of gold.
It's pretty much a cherry finish.
I can't believe we only paid $819.95 for it!
The stain is a lot more red and darker than it looks online.

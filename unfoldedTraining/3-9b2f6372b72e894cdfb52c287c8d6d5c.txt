It would be better to just have a bigger mic with the battery inside it and leave out the separate battery holder.3.
No complaints about that.If you are using the mic without the battery supply it should be great.
I need the battery supply.
This microphone picks up sound just fine.
Where do you put this when the mic is on your lapel?
I'm getting used to it, but when you switch it on the battery indicator doesn't stay on, so you can't tell by looking if it's on or not.
Battery switch is confusing.
Difficult to open.
The required battery is an odd type.
I have three complaints:1.
Makes it difficult to remember to turn it on or off, which is almost a deal breaker for someone like me.
Why not go with something standard?2.
Awkwardly shaped, it creates an inconvenient package in the middle of the mic line.
The design is not helpful.
The battery holder is gimpy.
I don't know.

I give the graphics a 8.5.
With gorgeous courses and sweet player models.
Cool combos and tricks.
This game is a must have.
I give the gameplay a 9.5.
The graphics are decent but not perfect.
Although the music gets annoying after a while, it does have some cool songs.
Other then that the graphics are superb.
Pro Skater is really addicting.
The gameplay is excellent.
The sound effects are also good.
But in real life they would yell and scream.
The sound is top notch.
I give the sound a 9.0.
The game also lacks colors but who cares.
My only complaint about the sound is when skaters fall they say ouch and grunts.
Once you start you cant stop playing.
There are some glitches in the game but nothing to worry about.
This game is sweet!
Although the camera gets annoying sometimes.

I like a lot of bad movies, if they have a silly quality to them.
But I was not expecting the depths to which this movie sank.
I was horrifed, revolted, sickened, and fascinated all at the same time.
This is not for those with squeamish stomachs.
I think it would appeal to certain fetishists.
Be warned.
This crosses the line to a new level of indecency.
If you can't take a lot of blood, stay away from this one.
This one set out to take torture and violence to a new low, and it does.
I was expecting lots of trashy scenes.
I gave it four stars for what it is, which is an exploitation film taken to new depths.
There is a level of torture I have only seen on one other vile film.
I think this one crosses the shakey line of depravity all the way into nauseating.
This is extreme gore.
This is a prison film/gore fest combination film.
I like bad sexpoitation movies.
I gave it four stars for it's no holds barred sadism, the likes of which is rare in a film.
I like bad movies.

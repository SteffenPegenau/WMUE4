Awesome!
I made $5000 on a unique stunt bonus.
Great stunt opportunities as you learn your way around.
Fit into civilization, or go wild.
The visuals are great.
Blood shooting 6 feet in the air until the corpse falls to the ground.
High blood and gore factors.
This is a violent game.
I suggest having a fast computer with good graphics and good sound.
Knock off a leg and watch as he hobbles around for a minute before dying.
After he has run about a block away, I like to pull out my sniper rifle and take out my aggro on his head.
A totally immersive world, where you can do anything you want.
Missions are great, some hard, some are not so hard.
A garage where you can save your car with your game.
This game is like a cross between Midtown Madness and Soldier of Fortune.
My favorite thing to do is, walk out into traffic, Stop a car, give the driver a bird, steal his car, get right back out of his car, and shoot him in the arm.

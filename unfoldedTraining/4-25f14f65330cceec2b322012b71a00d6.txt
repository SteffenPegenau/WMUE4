The Effects are great.
Battra is like a dark Mothra.
Mecha Ghidorah is cool.
Godzilla is bigger than ever.
Godzilla vs King Ghidorah is to me the best of the 1990s Godzilla movies.
Ghidorah is nothing like the 1960s in terms of voice or flying style (you cant bring back the 1960s) The score is excellent an update from the 1960s.
The sequel is Godzilla vs Queen Mothra battle for the Earth which has the return of Mothra and the debut of Battra.
A bit confusing with the time traveling and trying to rewrite Godzilla.
Aside from the time traveling stuff which was a little hard to follow, this was a great film.
Both start as larva and become moth monsters.
The DVDs are full frame, and English dubbed,but who cares its Godzilla :) at least there is an official release of these 2 movies.
Excellent Godzilla movie.
There are a lot of twists and turns and which monster is the bad guy in this.
Great SPFX, Mothra has new powers.
I found this to be enjoyable.

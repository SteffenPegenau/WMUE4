The controls are abysmal.
When I scan the drive with my computer, these ghost songs aren't even there, but yet they continue to play.
?The biggest nuisance is that when I put songs into the player, I have no idea how many are actually going to play.
I've had this player for about 6 weeks.
Worse yet, several of the 13 songs weren't even songs that I had loaded.
Oddly enough, I've noticed quite a few positive reviews for this player wherein the author actually noted the freeze-ups and yet still gave it a good review.
All of these glitches have been there since day 1.
These songs had been deleted a few days ago.
The player recognized 13 of them.
I would not recommend this item.
Even at $17, this player isn't worth it.Andrew

The player freezes up when trying to switch from radio mode to mp3 mode.
I have to remove the battery to un-freeze it.
This morning I loaded about 50 songs on the drive.

If you want to swallow whatever the mainstream music industry tells you to, then this CD is for you.
The lyrics are sub-par.
They go verse, chorus, verse, chorus, blah blah blah.
If you are looking for metal, this isn't it.
It doesn't take much imagination to come up with something so simple.
Evanescence is alternative pop rock.
She is above average, but she doesn't have what it takes to be really great.
Amy Lee is not an exceptional singer.
I can't believe people are calling it metal.
Frankly, I hated it.
I would much rather listen to talented singers, like Tarja from Nightwish, or Vibeke from Tristania.Also, their songs are boring.
Evanescence is totally overrated.
It is an insult to real metal.
Nevermind the riffs are something that should only appeal to a 14 year old Hot Topic poster child.Evanescence is just a trend that will hopefully pass quickly.
Her voice is very distorted and it sounds like she has never heard of breath control.

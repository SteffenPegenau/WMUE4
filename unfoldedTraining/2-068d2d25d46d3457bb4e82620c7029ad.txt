Those of you who have played the game know what I mean.
However, it does not become so important to have until after you reach the lost library.
I have no major problem with the book.
Where is the revolver?
However it is here in Alexandria that we first learn there is a magoer problem.
No.
They neglected to tell us where it is and how to get it.
As usual... the pics are great.
the next level is the first level in which the revolver is important.
This Guide is pretty much useless now.
Up until Alexandria...
I hope to find one that tells me where to find the revolver.
However, the pics alone are not going to get you through the game.
So now without the revolver, I came looking for another book.
Did we miss something??

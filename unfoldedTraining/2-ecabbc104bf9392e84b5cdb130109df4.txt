Save your money.
I have to admit, when I started the game, it looked really awesome.
I thought I would be able to fly with the character.
The board doesn't go as high as you would think.
It is like a few inches from the ground.
Doesn't turn out that way.
The mobility is not too good.
I got to the third level and just realized it was not a good game.
It is just like any other sports game, where you have objectives.
The game seems a bit old, too.
The objectives are really dumb.
The levels are dumb, the graphics are ok, the music and sound is horrible, and the story line is lame.
I just don't want anyone to be dissappointed the way I am.
It is hard and the music is horrible.
I don't think you should get this game.
I would recommend Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 over this any day.
I kept playing it.

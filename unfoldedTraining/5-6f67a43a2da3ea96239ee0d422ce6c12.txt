Jackson is sent to trial.
You can just tell that a battle is going to happen.
Because it not only shows what men do under heavy fire, it also shows what they would really do.
When he orders his men to fire into a crowd containing men, women and children.
Tommy Lee Jones must some how prove that Jackson and his men had been fired upon from the crowd.
A very real story centering around Marines, and a realistic view of war and every other day stuff helps give us a good view of men who risk there lives for others!
Later on in the film there is another battle taking place and this seems to be one of the most realistic I've ever seen.
Not just have it sugar coated for the audience.
An excellant film!
Samuel L. Jackson plays a Marine in charge of a rescue mission to save an American ambassador.
Why?
Without words this sets the tone.
Looking at the opening part of the movie, one can tell that it is Vietnam.
When it does the images are real.
Great sound and sound effects editing!

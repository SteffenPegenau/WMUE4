I can now cook all of my breakfast at once !!!
I then ordered from my trusty amazon vendor and got it withing a week of date of purchase I believe !!!!
Thanks and God Bless You !!!!
I love it except it was too small to fix all my breakfast at once.
I find this to be true almost all of the time !!!
I love this !!!!!
That is why I wanted the Big Griddle.
!Kathy Castleberry
I had a smaller presto griddle before.
I hope this is of help to someone !!!!
I am not sure yet how exactly the tilt and drain feature works yet ?
I got the best price from Amazon !!!
Anyone that has more people in the family would love it !!!
The griddle is larger than I expected or wanted ; however I am only a family of 2.
I shop amazon frequently !!!!!
I ordered this same griddle back in November from another vendor and I still didn't have it a month later or longer !!!
I cancelled the order with the other vendor which had the price a few pennies cheaper than amazon at the time.

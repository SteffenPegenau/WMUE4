Saw the previews for the second part, where the relationship really takes off, and poof!
Dearest Robson Green fans .
We go straight to the last lap, where Anna decides which man she will go with, if either!
I got to see the first part, which I had missed while it was showing on PBS.
Hoping it was merely a fluke with the video, I sent it back, and ordered another one.
It's too disappointing not to have the whole thing!
Wonderful.
.
I give it 2 stars, just because Robson is so appealing.
I was devastated!
I bought this video set, and when it arrived, I made my popcorn and settled down for a long night of living vicariously through Anna Crane (Francesca Annis) and her steamy love affair with gorgeous Owen Springer (Robson Green).
I don't know how the distributors got away with this, but wait for it to be redistributed, if it ever is.
Finally it arrived and poof!
Still no middle scene!
Hoping and wishing it was a fluke!
Nothing!

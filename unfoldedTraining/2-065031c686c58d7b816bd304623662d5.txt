Much like the monsters had to get Boo back to her family in Monsters Inc. Much like the Sloth and Mammoth had to get the baby back to it's family in Ice Age (non-Pixar movie).
Hey!
Kind of like the movie itself!
Oh yeah, wasn't Dinosaur about getting someone back to its family too?
Case in point, Finding Nemo is basically just chase after chase after chase after chase after CHASE!
Okay, naming one of the fish's 'Gill' is so basic, and lazy, and just flat-out pathetic.
Heh.
They need to get Nemo back to his dad!
That's like calling an elephant 'Trunk', or a tiger 'Stripes'... uh oh, I'm giving Pixar more ideas for their NEXT "masterpiece".
Much like... oh well, you get the point.
Lame and boring.
Some kid being lost and someone trying to save him and get him back to his family.
I know what to expect.
Much like the toys getting back to Andy in Toy Story.
Guess it's tough being a fish.

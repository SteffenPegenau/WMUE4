"I fight to the end for the night of my life, And nothing can stand in my way, And love has a colour and colours are many, Blue is for lonely and red is for danger."
And then there's Barry Gibb.
I am a big fan of Barbra.
The lyrics to the songs are... in a word... bad.
Hunh??
I've seen a few interviews with Barbra and truthfully she seems depressed, terribly, terribly depressed.
I was very disappointed in what I heard.
Her normally very agile voice was subdued and lethargic.
It's like a "word salad."
There was no joy in her song.
I was really looking forward to some new music from Ms. Streisand.
I don't think she wanted to do this album and it seems pretty evident.
Have been since I was a kid and my mom and I would go on road trips and sing along with "Guilty," "Evergreeen," "People"... etc.
By the way when I bought this album, I also got her "Essential" two CD set.
Get a real voice!
I'm loving that!!

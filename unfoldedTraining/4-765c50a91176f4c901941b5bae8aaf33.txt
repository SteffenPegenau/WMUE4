All the better to keep them alive with, my dear.
I found myself wanting for more from his point of view.
Still, I have a couple of lingering questions.
This could be an interesting series...
Upon discovering that it dealt with a torturer-in-training, I began to lose interest.
And Noycannir sure was evil to the core....
Though the subject matter is difficult to stomach at times, it is interesting.
When I started reading this book, I had no idea at all what it was about.
I find Andrej to be a very interesting character, and I just loved Joslire.
I want to know more about the interrelationships of the species, and about some of the issues hinted at in this book - shortages of grain, for instance.
I intend to read on.
To use highly trained medical professionals as torturers seems a bit odd, but it makes sense if you take it in context.
I want to know more about this universe that Matthews has created.
But then I picked it up again.
And again.

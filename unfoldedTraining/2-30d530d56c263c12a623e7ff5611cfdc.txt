Being a G fan to the fullest, I was thoroughly disappointed with this piece of junk.
4th Godzilla takes forever to show.
2nd the music was totally out of place.
3rd the characters are totally unlikeable.
King Caesar(sp) why ??
Even with all the monsters, SPFX.
Monster X was neat, and became Kaiser Ghidorah at the end...
Nothing traditional about this.
I thought this was the worst Godzilla movie of all time.
There were a lot of Hedorah fans who got to see their monster come back, looking different, and a screen time of 1 minute.
Ebirah gets a minute in the movie.
5th this movie just sucked.
First the monsters werent on screen long enough.
Minya Why ???
Gigan, Rodan and Mothra were cool.
Who was this Hedorah I would have liked to have known more.

The supplied chisel bit was so-so.
Setup and adjustment took only a couple of hours.3.
I have made several hundred mortises in white oak, cherry and white maple.
Plenty of power, it doesn't even groan a bit on 3/4 inch mortise 2 inches deep in white oak.5.
I grew tired of trying to cut mortises with my router.
I have had NO racking problems4.
Hold down is exceptional.
Great value.
I am very pleased with the machine.Pros:1.
Arrived on time and undamaged.2.
I replaced it with solid red oak.2.
Easy to adjust handle, I can always set it for best stroke.Cons:1.
Fiber board cutting base is a little cheap.
I would like a micro adjustment on the depth control rod.No question I would buy this machine again.
I purchased this machine after receiving orders for several pieces of mission furniture.
Dual rods work very smooth.6.
I purchased a set from lee-valley (the ones from Japan) and they work exceptionally well.3.

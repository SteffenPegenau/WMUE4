The battery seems to be running shorter.
Im not sure if the MD has what it takes to avoid being the betamax recorder of the 90's.
They last longer, but the car power cord wont charge the Li battery.
I wish there were a bigger selection of pre-recorded music available.
its been around for a long time but hasn't seemd to really catch on yet.
I love it!
I didnt think lithium-ion developed a memory.
I got the external AA pack and car power cord.
The sound quality is really good, and it has been pretty reliable.
The UTOC (Unable Table of Contents, like the directory on a computer disk)that some the others have experienced has only happened to me using sony discs.
Replacement Li is expensive.
There are a few squawks I have though.
We'll see.
I use Memorex now, never have that problem.
I got my MS-702 last summer.

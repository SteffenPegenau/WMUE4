Emeril is a joke as a chef.
It is also told how to react when given little tidbits of some amazing dish he threw together.
What a rip-off!
Most of it was absolute crap.
The recipes in this book are borderline insults to real Louisiana cooking.
What it looks like and what it tastes like are two different things.
Is it possible for him to cook just one dish without using a ridiculous list of ingredients and acting like a moron?
The man has an over-sized ego and very little talent.
I've even been to one of his tapings.
Either of those could cook circles around this clown.
This book is a total waste of money.
For someone who keeps repeating that cooking 'aint rocket science', his recipes are anything but easy.
If you want real Louisiana cooking, look for a book from Paul Prudhomme or John Folse.
Doubtful.
The audience is reminded over and over when to cheer for something he has done.
It is well known throughout the cooking world that he couldn't boil water to save his life.

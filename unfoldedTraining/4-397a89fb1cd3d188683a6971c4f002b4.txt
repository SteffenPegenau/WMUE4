I loved the pace of the novel and the tension it created.
.
.
I was left wanting the story to go on, and will look for the sequel.
I do fear, though, that my memories of Vancouver will now be influenced by this book .
.
or not?
.
The book could have been longer, with more development of the characters.
was Jackson Cole someone I met on my trip, .
I picked up this book at the recommendation of a Chapters salesperson in Vancouver on a recent trip.
I enjoyed the Vancouver references since I'd just visited a few of these places.
Started reading it on the plane on the way home.
But I was instantly grabbed by Jackson Cole, and desperately hope Ms. Smith includes him as the main character in a series.
It even referenced blueberry tea which I ordered once thinking I was actually getting blueberry tea!This book had a lot of characters which I sometimes had trouble keeping straight, but which I wanted to know more about.

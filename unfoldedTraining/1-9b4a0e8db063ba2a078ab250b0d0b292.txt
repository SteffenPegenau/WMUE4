Pitt and Charlotte used to care about the little people.
Perry used to write good, thought provoking books on the hypocrasies and horrors of Victorian society.
But they provide "glamour", so let's keep them.
The evils of change.
They have become reactionaries bent on preserving the status quo.
And the people who would like to get rid of them, and set up a more equalitarian society, are portrayed as power-hungry monsters.
Baroness Orczy would love the book, which glorifies the Royal family, even while admitting that they are nothing more than useless drains on the budget.
What a shame.
This book is about how to preserve the status quo.
She has written another bad Thomas and Charlotte Pitt book.
Oh well, there's always William and Hester.
No more.
I think I will stick to her other series.
Gag.
I guess once Pitt became a fairly wealthy man, he forgot his roots.
Well, Anne Perry has done it again.

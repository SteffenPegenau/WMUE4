To get to the point quick, it was a little long.
Albeit too strong.
It was detailed (though not overly so) and it consisted of some impossible feats.
Probably not.
The fact that in every sci-fi book humans overcome everyone that is different gets kind of old.
Battlefeild Earth was a good book.
I like the fact that it was about a group of people trying to overthrough their conquerors.
What didn't I like about the story.
But, this is sci-fi.
So, what did I like about it.
I liked the battles and I liked the main character in that he was strong.
Will it change your life.
But again this book is just a plain old good story.
It is a good story if you are interested in being entertained.
However, having never read L. Ron Hubbard before or not knowing much about dyanetics, I thought this book was good.
The fact that again it is a story about humans killing everyone else.

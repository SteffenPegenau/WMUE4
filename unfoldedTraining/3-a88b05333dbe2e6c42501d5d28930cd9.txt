A very cynical, sexist, cocky and genuine first person.
That is the problem with the last one hundred pages.
"I" can't be killed.
What's the problem?
The narrator's partner is expendible.
I couldn't wait to reopen the book, even when I discovered the bad guy a hundred pages earlier.Me?
For 80% of the book, "I" wasn't relevant to the great tension & intrigue.
Not by bullets, gas or ocean.
The point of view is first person.
We know the bad guy.
Maybe I appreciate seaside tales because I was raised in land-locked Ohio.
I?
We are all in a hurricane.
You had me for 400 pages.
"I" am alive.
Awfully personal!
In this case -- the "I's" don't have it.
There was no tension in the climax because "I" am alive.It is a shame for the author to have gone so far with a colorful plot, only to lose it at the end.
"I" am narrating.

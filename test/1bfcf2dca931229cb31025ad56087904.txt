?Where is she now?
what happened to her?
ok, ok, ok, so the movie is ok , but nowhere near as good as the book.
BUT achually what I really want to know is "What happened to the Lady Chablis?
You need to amble through Savannah with the author at the pace of Savannah ( which is greek-island-on-a-hot-afternoon pace ie SLOW. )
I wish her luck.
If you thnik that the characters can't be real , slow down and LOOK around your own place, there are chacters like Savannah's everywhere.
( I'm English) .
once agin we are shown how the written word can fill our imaginations much more than a literial filmatic translation.
DON"T read this book if you want a thriller type murder straight line mystery.
Does anyone know?
It is NOT that kind of book and doesn't try to be.
Americans are eccentric to me!!!!
Perhaps not so many ,so obvious, but just you watch and listen you'll find them.

Kick stand is also a must have.
To prevent this, I taped the switch to the on position.
In closing I highly recommend this product and all its attachments.
Boy did the Thatcher bring out the dead grass.
Also purchased the Thatcher and aerator attachments.
Make a bigger job than what I thought, so leave yourself enough time.
There is little chance that the machine will be running and you getting your body stuck in it unless you do something stupid.
Also did a fantastic job.
Roots did get wrapped around the tillers, but only cleared them out every 300 sq feet or so because I wanted to not because I need to.
Light but man this thing is a bull.
Only took 2-3 minutes to clear.
Worked fantastic on about 1000 sq feet of hard, root and rock infested land.
Incredible piece of machinery.
Get weed reducers.
Only problem with the tiller is that the on/off switch is too close to the right thumb area so you accidentally shut off the unit a lot.

[The] XBOX's headset and starter kit [is reasonably priced].
I bought a subscribtion for S.O.C.O.M.
2 weeks ago i got it right before christmas.
THe best thing is it is only for Broadband users so it guarentees no lag.
The other day i was at my friends house who bought XBOX and XBOX Live.
You get your own "gametag" and you can play whatever games you want until your one year subscription is up.
This thing is really cool.
Navy Seals and everything.
I called up sony and they said it was because that the people i was playing didn't have a broadband connection.
... Trust me, it was amazing.
It comes with a 1-year subscription for ALL games.
For Christmast i got offroad fury.
The first game i played was amazing.
Then the next 5 games were all lagging.
No lag or anything.
I cant believe you have to pay for every subscription.

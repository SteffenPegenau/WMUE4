I guarantee you that this game will keep you on the edge of your seat... always!
Do not let the name of this game fool you.
Remember that each review is stating one person's opinion.
It is very fun and interesting, with many different levels and rounds.
I must say that this game is not exactly for five year olds, like they said, because it's too hard!
Their opinion might not be yours.
Once the game's over, it starts at the beginning of the level: not the round.
It is actually suprisingly challenging.
Who would have thought?
I have never liked cartoons, and for the strangest reason, I found this too good to be true!
What a relief!
This may not be your thing.
If you like the classic, fun, happy, old, gameboy game, you've got yourself a purchase.
When you enter the second level, and the game's over, it brings you to the beginning of the second level: not the first.
Just take my word for it.
There are about five rounds in one level.

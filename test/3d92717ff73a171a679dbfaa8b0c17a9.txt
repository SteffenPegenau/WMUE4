The visuals were stunning.
This game was so much fun.
It is never the same again.
Would I actually play this game all the way through again just cause I have some new plasmids?
Once I beat a game its done.
Then the game is over.
The music and genre felt like an epic 1920's storyline.
These new plasmid type weapons that eradicate enemies from your left arm are too cool !!!!!!!
I will never put this game in the xbox again.
Well I beat it in 2 days.
There is no reason I had to waste $50-60 just to beat it in 2 days.
I read an article were the game creator is talking about releasing new plasmids for xbox live download.
Save your money and rent it.
NO WAY!
It loses its grandeur.
It also has no multiplayer so the replay value is absolutely ZERO.Summary: This is probably the coolest game you will play this year.
Just as fast as it started and swallowed me into this underwater world, it was over.

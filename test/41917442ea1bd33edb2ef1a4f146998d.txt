There were so many things wrong.
The lead black man was also engaging; the problem was really the script.
There was good cinematography and music, and Kevin Bacon is always appealing, but that's the best I can say.
And there were no signs of the burned buildings during the basketball game.
She was pretty good too.
Except for the presence of Kevin Bacon, whom I like a lot, this would have been a real loser.
You knew what was coming a mile away.
And Bacon was supposed to climb this incredible mountain, get cut in the groin, then play basketball, all on a rotten knee.
Oh, and the nun.
Too pat, and too many unbelievable things that screamed "Hollywood".
As if it takes generations to rebuild their houses.
They were ready to just up and leave where they'd lived for generations.
Please.
Directed by Paul Glaser with no surprises, no depth of character, a too heavy-handed Hollywood scenario.
Like when the village burned down.

All in all, the book just isn't that great.
That is clearly not the Jedi way.
Zahn didn't put enough descriptions in the book.
I also had a problem with Luke giving Leia a lightsaber that he made for her.
Why so many apostrophes?
Then, there is the boring dialogue.
I also have a problem with Ackbar on the New Republic Council.
Everyone always says "Point" and "Agreed".
), Lando's "Necr'ygor Omic wine" and "Fey'lya".
If he is an Admiral, why is he on a civilian council?
Can't anyone say, "You have a point there" or "I agree with you"?
She should make her own lightsaber when she is ready.
I didn't like Zahn's choices of weird names, like "ysalamiri" or the planet "Bpfassh" (how do you pronounce those?
He never really describes the settings in the book, and while you are supposed to use your imagination while reading a book, describing the setting would have made the action scenes more interesting.
Why??

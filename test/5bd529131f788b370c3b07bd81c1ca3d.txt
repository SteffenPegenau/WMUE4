Its almost like interacting with a MOVIE.
If you like to fly and love a good story line buy this game.
But hey the game is that good.
But I have to say this game is nothing short of AMAZING.
I found myself worrying about the person and rushing through the next mission just to make sure they were safe.
And have been playing them for a long time.
Now I love flight sim's.
I have been a gamer since the first ATARI system came into play.
Don't wait !!!!
At one point in the game one of the main character's gets shot down and you have to go rescue them.
The story line is awsome and the character's make you think that they are REAL people firghting for their live's.
Now yes I know im pathetic.
I am AMAZED at how far games have come from the good ol days of atari's COMBAT to the high end graphics and story lines of ACE COMBAT 5.
It draws you into another world.

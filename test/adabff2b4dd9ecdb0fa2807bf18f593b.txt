I was going to get a size 8 but they werent available so I got a size 7.5 instead.
They came early, they were a great price- I think mine were around $15-$19!
At first when I opened the box, I thought they were used because the shoe box was all "worn out" and stuff, but the shoes weren't used.
THey are sooo comfy and they look great on me unlike my friend's Emu Boots.
The sole is the strong-durable like kind.
I just got my pair of Boots today in the mail.
Still leaving room for my toes to wiggle around.
Thank You !
I was actually expecting them to arrive Jan.4th-Han.8th, but they came two days earlier !
That's a great deal for brand new boots like these.
I love them.
So, I was very surprised and happy about that.
I really like them.
They are actually cuter than they appear on the picture.
They fit perfectly.
They are amazing.
Made of rubber, and you can roll the top of the boots so the fur on the inside will show.

They also added scenes that never happened in the book.
I think the book is much better than the movie.
I imagined the characters differently.
I think the movie was not well planed according to the book.
The some of the setting were like I imaged, like the Curtis brothers house, but other were different like the part and the church.
The movie didn't really discuss the main themes of the book.
The movie didn't touch me that much.
The world that I imaged while reading the book was a little different when I saw the movie.
The book is really detailed.
Like when Ponyboy is dreaming when his parents died in a train accident.
You can picture everything that is happening.
All of the main characters were in the movie, but they really didn't introduce many of them.
They skipped a lot of events that happened in the book.
While I was reading the book it made me cry.
Like I said they skipped a lot og events and every thing happened to fast.

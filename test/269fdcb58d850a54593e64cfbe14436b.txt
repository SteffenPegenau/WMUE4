It is really great.
I mow about 1/2 acre that isn't flat and I don't get tired with this mower like I did the yardman.
Other than that I am very satisfied with my purchase.
I like this mower so much better and I paid about $100 less for it.
I have a yardman rear propelled mower with variable speed that is very heavy to operate.
I finished the rest of the mowing season with it.
It is not heavy to operate.
It listed at $480 and I purchased it for $250.
I would recommend this mower to anyone.
It doesn't stay on.
I don't have to fill up the gas tank as often with this mower either.
The only thing I don't like about it is the cheap plastic discharge chute they put on a $480 mower.
I have been mowing grass for about 10 years and it is one of the better mowers I have used.
It comes off all the time.
I purchased this mower in Aug. of 2007.
I paid $350 for the yardman and don't like it nearly as well.

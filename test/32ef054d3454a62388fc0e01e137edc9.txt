Bought this with it's trailer.
It had an extra axle, extra cap nuts, but missing the trailer hitch and the hardware for it.
I mentioned that it was a birthday present and I needed it by the weekend(it was Thursday) She said she'd try to get it to me as quickly as she could.
I got it in Saturdays mail.
I used two of em.
Still had seven left over.
The instructions should be read a few times before you try to assemble it.
I would buy one again, very tough outfit, the kids, and adults love it.
Was glad it came with the extra cap nuts.
I was extremely happy with the service I got.
I called Step Two, and talked to a woman there, explained what I needed, and was very satified with their help.
The wheels can be put on backwards, which I did, I put two on one way, two on the other way.
Not difficult, but some things should be thought out first.
It was the best I've had from anywhere in a long time.
It came with the assembly parts kinda screwed up.

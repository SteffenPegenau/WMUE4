however, tall tub also means the legs are restrained somehow.
there are only two blow heads, one for each foot.
these are pretty much standard features among all kinds of foot tubs.my problem is the remote control doesn't work.
water line any deeper than this may not practical because of the weight of water could be considerable for some people.
this is my first foot tub.
Even with these problems, I like it over all.
second, it is the deepest i have saw in stores, which gives a deep massage and i love it.
The experience has no regret.
massage nodes don't move by themselves.
hope it is the remote controller's problem.
the strength has high and low two settings.
i don't know the performance of other type.
but this one has strong enough flow.
i have to stop by the store tomorrow.
The solution might be finding a higher chair.
the heat is only on/off.

Oh.
It can get SO FREAKIN LOUD.
The tape recorder works really well.
Is it really nesscary?
The sound are really rich and even at high volumes the quality or the music is still really good.
Otherwise this system is Kikin!
It will even mark where the different songs start.
On max you can feel it from the next room.
And what's the poing of a rolling control panel???
So you gotta use mono.
The subwoofer rules!
The last problem is that when on stereo mode it sounds a little fuzzy.
This Minisystem rocks the house!
One bad thing about it is that it takes a little while for it to get a CD to play.
The 6 different sound modes really help.

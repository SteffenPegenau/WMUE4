That people never that these side effects.
I don't care about that.
Be careful and stop talking it before its too late.
It happened like over night the first day I lost two hand fulls of hair.
It says hair loss.
So, I am 30 years old and I am going bald.
Now my hair is thin and you can see my scalp.
Some other side effects: fatigue, stomach cramps, drowsiness, not able to concentrate, acme, dry scalp.
I used to have long, thick hair.
Read the label.
I was told that the hair loss side effect is written there just in case.
I went online, read customer reviews and I am not the only one who is losing hair.
I called customer service, they telling me to send back the pills and they will give me my money back.
Not only that it keeps falling out more.
Yeah, for all of you people - keep taking the product you may experience the same results as I am now.
I wanted to contact someone who knows if my hair will ever grow back.
After taking Relacore fore few weeks my hair started to fall out.

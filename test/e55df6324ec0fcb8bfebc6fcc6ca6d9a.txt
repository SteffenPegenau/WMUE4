I love all those.
Rachel was in She's All That with Freddie Prinze Jr. Rosario Dawson was in Men in Black 2 (another awesome flick; I got the dvd for christmas).
I don't own the DvD.
I am male, but I love it.
Good choice for everyone who likes movies of this genre.
American Pie, American Pie 2, and Van Wilder!
First of all, this movie rocks.
Tara Reid was in three of the BEST MOVIES EVER MADE!
Wassup, America?!
I gotta buy this in the next year.
If you like teen movies, the Pussycats are right for you!PEACE OUT!in the immortal words of Smokey from Friday:"...and you know this, man!"
I taped this on the STARZ channel one night while they were having a free preview weekend thingy.
NOT JUST A CHICK FLICK!
GUYS LIKE IT TOO!
The actresses that play the Pussycats (Rachel Leigh Cook, Rosario Dawson, Tara Reid) have been in some other great movies.

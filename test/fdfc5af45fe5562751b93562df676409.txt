"Once Upon A Midnight" hmmm...
The starting was ok.
This novella does not deserve to be in a book.
Both Allison and Heath are getting second chances at love.
A story of hope and love.
Dream Lover" was something I would not have picked up.
Nora didn't disappiont. "
I don't think nora Roberts actually knows how to write a bad book.
The Witching Hour" was Wonderful.
I really didn't like this one.
It was sweet and romantic.
I loved the romace between Fiona and Conor.
"Mirror, Mirror" was just as good as Wicthing hour, if not better.
This story was just not good.
The minor characters were two dimesional.
And the end, where Jenna turned out to be a wolf was just disturbing.
It was perfect.They went through a lot to save the prince and the journey was great."
But once I got into the story, I really liked it.

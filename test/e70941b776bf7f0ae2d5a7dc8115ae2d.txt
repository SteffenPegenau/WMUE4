The book is also pretty creepy, and makes you keep looking out your window to make sure the 'Goblins' aren't out there.
First off, Scully was the one who came up with the supernatural idea, and then believed it all when Mulder added on.
I was always chuckling, especially with her spray paint.
The old woman was hilarious!
The only problem was with Scully.
The story line was great, and very interesting.
Also the cursing got on my nerves.
On the show, she's usually saying something like "Why are we here Mulder?"
Now for the good points.
Second, usually Scully in the show is attacked by the mutant, murderer, alien, government man, monster, curse, whatever.
It was a very interesting story, with a shocking ending.
This time she was pretty safe the whole time.
not "This whole thing is a government conspiracy involving humans who can change their skin color."
Mulder got into the most trouble.
(That's not actually a real quote, but it's pretty close to what she says.)

This feels good in control & weight.
I hope it's rare.
I have had 2 other torches & have been frustrated (another story).
Hard for kids to move it.
I decided to try a different style.
A+
It has a "safety switch" too.
I'll let you know if it changes!My husband's favorite is creme brulee so I make it a lot.
Dont' waste your money on those wands or cheapos out there.
There is great control (flame strength) and the best part for me is I can hold it at any angle and it does not fluctuate in flame control or go out altogether when I hold it down.
Oh, my!
I haven't seen anyone who bought the other (color) Typhoons have the melting problem described by the previous reviewer.
This is my opinion.
It is very easy to fill & use.
I am VERY happy with this torch.

The puzzler though is: when did directors start thinking that topless women make for a good scary movie?
4 short films and nothing scary about any of them.
But scary?
Save your money.
I think there were topless women in just about every one of the short stories.
After all, when was the last time you saw anything good with John Saxon or Henry Gibson in it?
Was I wrong!
I should have known.
Entertaining to watch, maybe.
I figured that with 4 individual short films in this thing, at least 1 or 2 of them would be scary.
At least not as far as good scary horror moments go.However, if you're looking for lots of nudity, this is definitely worth a look.
I'm sorry I wasted MY time, that's for sure!
Well, don't expect much from this one either.
I don't think so.Save your time.
Check out something else instead of this lemon.
I took a chance and rented this one.

A real mixed bag.
It is, however, nothing great or memorable.
It's not mediocre enough to get two stars, but three stars might be too much.
"I Don't Want To Go On With You Like That", the first single, was a great, catchy, up-tempo song.
"Poor Cow" has a catchy beat but it is an instantly forgettable song.
"Goodbye Marlon Brando" is a fun rocker, but not classic Elton rock.
So much better stuff lay ahead of Elton and his fans.
"Japanese Hands", "Mona Lisa's And Mad Hatters(Part 2)", "The Camera Never Lies", and "Heavy Traffic" are the rest.
It's not a very consistent album.
The lyrics were fun, but kind of stupid.
Not bad.
"Since God Invented Girls", an obvious homage to Brian Wilson, is better and prettier.
The melody was insanely catchy and the lyrics were pretty cool.
But not great.
Reg Strikes Back, while pretty good, is not a great Elton John album.
It was a perfect Elton John song.
"A Word In Spanish" was a nice, airy, and enjoyable ballad.

So the picture is not what it could have been.
I don't want to see the crowd singing, reacting, etc, to everything.
Seems like all the big hits are included.
First the good.
Now for my problems.
A few shots here and there is ok...but there is way too much.
Music first.
All concerts should be like the James Taylor DVD.
What annoys me the most is that there is too much focus on the crowd.
Since I like the Beatles and Paul...it is hard not to give this four stars just based on the generous amount of Beatle tunes.
It is not widescreen either.
Paul sings great.
I hate it.
I want to see Paul...that's it.
The video is filmed, not shot with High Def cameras.
Since in a few years everyone will have HD widescreen, it would have been nice to preserve such a timeless concert as this in that format.
DTS surround is very nice.
Band is great.

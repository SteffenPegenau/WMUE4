The cheap DVDs are super-loud.
It was basically a dated hippie romp.
Y is that????!!!
I paid used @ about $22.
The only real one I was looking forward to is GAssssssss.
Well, for the price, no, indeed.
so, for 4 discs, it is an excellent price (even for the new price)!NOw this set of Roger Corman flicks is notorious for being the worst films ever made.
I am a fan of bad cinema (and 1970's nudity ) and this set doesn't let down the Tarintinoesque fan.As a package i have a HUGE beef.
You have to max the volume on my TV , for even to even make out the dialogue!!!!!!!
At least it could have been a little more serious, the setting was post-apocolyptic.Of the others, I really have seen (bits & pieces, wholly) Mama, trip, and X. the others are new to me.
Why are the DVDs doublesided???!!!!
Now you can protect the DVDs with much less certainty.And why is, on most DVDs with such WEAK SOUND!!!
I haver tried to find this film for years.
Was this CD box set a let down??

I was really suprised when I listen this album.
I was expecting it to be terrible.
It's R&B, Pop and Rock all together.
Raven is not a bad singer either.
Overall, Raven did good on this album but the only problem will be the promotion.
I guess the promotion behind this album was really bad.
I saw this CD in BEST BUY and I thought I should get it.
This CD is not so bad.
She doesn't have a Mariah, Celine, or Christina voice but she can carry a tune.
What I really like on this album is there's a mixture of songs.
She really got some good songs on this album.
The good CD's are getting no promotion.
I didn't even know that Raven was releasing an album so soon.
I think her voice is still maturing and she did good with the vocals.
These days, I hear a lot of good albums with bad promotion.
Wow!
I'm glad I did though.
There are a lot of CD's being released today and are selling millions but are garbage.

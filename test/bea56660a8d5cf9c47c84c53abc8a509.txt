He's having fun with it.
I suppose its to be expected since it is a pocket microscope.
The only reason I gave it 3 stars is for that reason.
We bought it as a replacement for another we purchased for my 7 year old son for Christmas.
The knobs were not so difficult to use as other reviews suggest.
It fits in the palm of my hand.
If he's outside he has to be on his knees leaning down to look at something and I wish I could find one that allowed him to be a bit further away.
Can't wait until after the snow melts and the mud dries up.
It worked out of the box after he figured out the part about putting the microscope right up against the item.
We got it on time and packaged very well.
My son will hours of fun with this.
I couldn't get it to work at first.
The first one didn't work so I purchased this one.
This microscope really is small.
Then my son figured out you have to put it right up against the item you are looking at it.

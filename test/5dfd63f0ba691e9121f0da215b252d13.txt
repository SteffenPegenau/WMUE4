Also, to Nintendo, if you ever make a Super Smash Brothers 2, BE SURE TO PUT CONKER IN IT!
They are beautiful.
BFD looks as good as Banjo-Tooie, while keeping a smoothe framerate.
This game is definately one of the greatest games available for the N64.
3rd, we have voices {for once}.
First up is graphics.
This game is funny, but in that South Park kind of way.
They are great.
Next, we have music.
All of the voices are incredibily done.
Anyway, I haven't officially BOUGHT the game yet, I just keep on renting, and renting, and renting, and renting, ect.
Conker has an endearing little lisp, Berri {Conker's girlfriend} has that like, y'know, Valley Girl talk.
Because we all would like to see who the REAL king of the video game mascots is.
Well, its true.
And, most importantly, humor.
Instead of the normal MIDIs that dribble out of games, BFD uses MP3s for its music, and it really does show.
Also, the Great Mighty Poo's song is SOOOOOOOO catchy.

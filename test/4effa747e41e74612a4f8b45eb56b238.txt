This is the fourth record and it is evolved music.
This band is very literary.
"Animals" is smooth rock.
Gravenhurst comes across as a very moody and smart band.
This band has been very eclectic.
"The Velvet Cell" recalls some of the earliest Lou Reed tracks.
The song "Down River" is much like Nick Cave in his best days.
Nick Talbot is the main person in the band here.
This is atmospheric heavy rock.
"Cities Beneath The Sea" recall Edgar Allen Poe.
I look forward to the live show.
It's very reminiscent of some shoegazer and folk records of the past twenty years.
"See My Friends" is a cover of a Kinks song.
Cool.
This is something worth checking out.
--I have just seen them live.
They are something like Belle & Sebastian or Ballboy.

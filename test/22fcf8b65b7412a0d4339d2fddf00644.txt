Fugeela, The Score.
My Favorite songs are Killing Me Softly, with the Exceptionally Talented Lauren Hill.
There allot of messages on this album.
This is a must buy.
If you want to delve deep into the minds of some talented artist this is a good start for a music lover collection.
But, I would recommend this album for young adult the mature individual.
Hopefully, soon.Anything Lauren and Wyclef touches turns to magic.
A great assemble with Wyclef and Pras.
You can feel there flow.
The language just takes away from the pure magic that flows with the music.I just wish there wasn't so much explict language but you cannot deny this Group Wonderful Talent.I look forward to there next album.
This albums flows very well.
I was torn.
Pras holds his own.If you are a Fugee fanatic.
I am giving this albums a 4 stars.
There is a song for every one.

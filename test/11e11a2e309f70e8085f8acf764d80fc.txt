I am sick of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis tunes.
.YAWN!
As for the album, only "SloLove" sounds current and may lead to some great remixes.
Is it just me, or is Janet Jackson trying to rip off Sade's "Love Deluxe" album cover?
..
Really, Janet.
The black & white shades, body position, hair, etc .
They have produced every album since Control .
If you ask me, Sade got it right the first time.
I also wish she would choose different procducers .
.
.
Maybe you should stick to pasties or military gear circa 1814.

The 32" inseam on the pants makes them a little short.
The belt is about 3" short of coming together... must be about 32-34".
This fit the bill for that--unobstructed face and hands.
The package says 38"-42" waist.
Worse than that, though is the belt.
I haven't bought a Halloween costume in ages, but I needed one for a Halloween themed community band concert.
I ordered the XL.
I think it will last more than one wear.
Since they're elastic waist and it's covered by the tunic, the pants should be long so that they can be rolled over at the waist and shortened for shorter people but still long enough for tall people.
That's why I gave this 3 stars.
I've got to be able to sit in it, see the director and play my instruments.
The materials are OK..
I normally wear a 40, but can wear a 38 that's a little snug.
It's a 4-piece costume with major issues in 1 piece and minor issues in another piece.
Will either have to mod or buy a different one of those.

If you've never heard of System Shock before, go on this...
I was a gamer for 5 years or so before this came out in 1994.
Those three collaberated on this outstanding classic PC game.
The graphics , 3 years AHEAD of its' time!
This was an early 'Looking Glass' game!
Those guys went on to do THIEF!
And, i have never looked back.
I cannot even explain how much this game affected me.
(Athlon).
The plot, incredible.
There has never been a more powerful team than 'Looking Glass','Origin', and 'Modern Age Books'!
The instant i installed it, i was drawn in.
The graphics now look dated, but the game will always be great.
I was even able to get this to run on my XP system!
It will show them how greatness began!
I hope every gamer gets the chance to play this at least once.

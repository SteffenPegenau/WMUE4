But it won't be a Krups!
So obviously, the easy answer is ...
The good news - it's still under warranty.
This model was adjustable up to 5 hours, so that was a personal plus.
I emptied it and tried to run wather through it - lights go on, but it doesn't do anything.
I'll have to buy a new coffee maker.
The bad news - I have to send it to a service center for repair or replacement.
The closest service center to me is about 300 miles away.
The unit said it was on, but the burner was cold.
Today it suddenly stopped working.
Beyond that point, the coffee maker worked fine and the coffee tasted good.
Thankfully, it went away after a few weeks of use.
When I first got it, there was a strong plastictaste in the coffee.
I bought this unit less than a year ago.
I went to get a cup of coffee and it was cold.
I ran clear water through it five or six times, but the bad taste remained.
An important feature for me is an auto shutoff that allows more than two hours.

as in National Lampoon's Vacation.
.
I kept getting this " I've seen this one before " feeling as I sat through this movie.
You can't go wrong with The World According to Garp.
.
I think he should stick to his more dramatic roles.
I still think his best work was his first.
There are a few laughs but they are few and far between.
The one big difference in the two movies is Robin Williams is a less funnier Chevy Chase.Every lame worse case senerio you can think of happens in this movie.
I'd recommend renting One Hour Photo to offset seeing this movie.
Everything is very predictible and most of it falls pretty flat.
There are alot of sappy family moments too.
This movie has been done before.
Most of those moments don't payoff either.Robin is way over the top as he usually is.
Then it hit me.

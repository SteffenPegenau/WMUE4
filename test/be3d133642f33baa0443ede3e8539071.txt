they later get married and have a kid.
she can start fires by will alone.
the man and the child is forced to escape and hide.
events: mostly not that interesting.
one day they by misfortune kill the woman.
characters:uninteresting.
usually, SK gives you something, but this simply doesn't.
actually, i liked the father and his ability much more than the kid.
plot:mediocre.
etc.
there is an indian here having a large role, that i never appreciated.
this is a thriller, carried out ok. what i found sad, was that it really didn't have anything to recommend it.
the man turns out to have a certain ability, but it's the kid that really has a "gift".
psychology:strangely absent (to be king, he is usually better).
this is the story about how they manage (i won't give anym more away).
descriptions:can't even remember them.
boy meets girl during an experiment.
the family is under surveillance by an agency.

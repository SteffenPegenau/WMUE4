most of the requests that i got from my listeners were for songs by steele pluse(second only to bob..and maybe toots).
but, it is a good hook.
matter of factly, the songs requested were all located on this particular disc.
i was a radio host in college(i had a reggae show).
peace to all my guyanese brethen and sistren.
hey lego beast, wanna play?
smash hits is the first album by the group that i purchased.
for one, the vocals are more clear here than they are on some of the group's earlier works(i.e handsworth revolution).
all the songs on the disc are of good quality.
!
God bless all!!
and now i am hooked!
my favorite songs on the disc are: rave, chant a psalm, roller skates and of course lego beast.
(just joking).
i am proud of the fact that i made a good choice(since i was just getting into reggae at the time).

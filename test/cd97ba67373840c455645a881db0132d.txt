99% of the songs on this album deal with the same sub-genre - Murderin.
Get this and definitely "Mr.
if you don't already have it.
Gone
"Mr. Lunasick" has a variety of songs from Gangsta to females to smooth to just kickin it.
I liked his first album "Mr. Lunasick" but this is almost just as good.
Andy, DJ Daryl, One Drop Scott, B.C.
and the rest of AWOL's producers are off da chain Dog!
Lunasicc."
I admit his flows are the sickest on this album.
The songs on the first album were more diverse (with the beats and everythang.)
Nice album.
My favorite song on this album is "Back to Back."
I like Hollis' beats but they all SOUND THE SAME!
This is still much better than all of his proceeding albums like "Totall Recall" and "Luni Coleone.com."
"Major Figgaz" is also tizight along with "12:00," "Can You Hang," and "Strictly Business."

Murray McLauchlan (Canadian songwriter) 7.
Nevertheless, I applaud this great begining!
MUSICHOUND FOLK: THE ESSENTIAL ALBUM GUIDE is one of the best and most complete compilations of reviews and descriptions of folk artists' works that I have yet seen.
Bob Carpenter ( Canadian songwriter) 3.
Michael Chapman (British folk/Rocker) 10.
!
Lee Clayton (Folk/Country artist) 4.
Terry and Gay Woods (Terry was in the Pogues and both were in Steeleye Span) This is a short list but it is evident that more research into British and Canadian folk music would improve this book.
Tom Rapp (Pearls Before Swine) 2.
John Martyn (British Folk/Rock artist) 5.
Lindisfarne (British Folk/Rock band) 9.
Decameron (British Folk/Rock band) 8.
Willie P. Bennett (Canadian songwriter) 6.
!However, I would like to recommend that the inclusion of the following artists would improve the coverage and render the book even more comprehensive!!1.
Bravo for an excellent start!

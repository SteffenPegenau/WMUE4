He insults Meredith at every turn and yet she practically pants whenever he touches her.
In fact, my mind kept wandering to her late husband, Henry Tennison.
The boardroom scenes were great even though the plot did drag quite a bit at times.
He was definitely beneath her.
The premise of Meredith's revenge was intriguing and unlike other Diana Palmer books.
Even the bodyguard, Mr. Smith, had lots of promise.
What a sexist pig!
I have a hard time picturing a truly happily ever after for this couple.
I guess Diana Palmer likes her heroes flawed.
The only real fly in the ointment was that oaf of a hero, Cy Harden.
Both of these characters were more manly than the juvenile Cy Harden.
Too bad he died.
I found her character strong, smart and entirely too forgiving of Cy and his mother, Myrna.
This man certainly was.
I couldn't figure out why someone like her would want him.

And don't forget, BEWARE OF THE BLOB!!!
Only Hellen Dump's.
Also pay attention to the movie theater scene.
Besides her terrible acting there is also this annoying little brother.
I mean Crump.
I luv everything about this movie.
You may just catch a smile or two.
Thank you god for this masterpiece of a movie.
Steve McQueen is awesome and I luv a cheesy horror flick.
Her being in this and Bad Ronald is about all she ever did outside the county lines of Mayberry.
It is so cheesy, it is so, funny, it is so FAKE.
When they're running out of the theater pay close attention to some of the victims reactions.
Hellen crump from Mayberry looks a little younger but not much.
Who's brother could it be you ask?

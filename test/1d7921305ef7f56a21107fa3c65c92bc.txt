but to touch nas is cruelty to the industry.
not a bad cd.
This is rediculous.
i just hope and pray that Nas retaliates and comes out with Ether Part II.
The cd isn't bad and i respectED him for changing up his tone and flow but damn!
Dis jada.
I just can't get past the fact that he has the balls to diss Nas.
he can even diss his main man, emishmem.
but i can't fathom what is goin on in his big ass head.
Dis ja rule.
maybe hes got a little lead still stuck up in his grill.
50 just lost a devoted fan.
He lost every ounce of respect i HAD for him by even reciting the name, 'Nas.'
Nas is on the top 5 list of the greatest rappers and 50 isn't even on the top 10.
Dis fatty.

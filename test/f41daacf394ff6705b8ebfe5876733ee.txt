Wow!!
Now the stand out tracks on here are Sexibition,Strawberry Bounce, All Nite(Don't Stop), R&B Junkie, Thinkin' Bout My Ex, And Just A little While.
You will not be dissapointed...
This album is one of her best if not the best she's done.
She has what i call i good work out/dance track on the album calleD "Just A Little While".
And although it does have it's "sexy songs", they aren't really that nasty becaue she is singing about it in a different way.
The song i'm talking about is MOIST.
This song is so damn good it hurts me.
(LOL) And her interlude "Country", is funny.
I've been a fan for years and i love her even more now that i've heard her "OTHER" side!!!
It's very easy to listen to.
Before the album was released i thought that it would bore me because i thought that it would be all about nasty sexual things.
I love the DAMITA JO side of Janet.
You just put it in and jam to it.
What can i say about this.

Nothing is keeping them back.
This band has been together since 1997.
Hoppy Kamiyama who is more known for his efforts in Japanese noise produced this album.
They are quite entertaining as a live act.
The wear costumes, makeup, and head masks.
"Pujeva" is a cool electro track that is more like Cooler Kids.
This may be a band to check out anyway.
Nothing is awkward.
Each member sings.
Many bands from Japan are really good or novelty acts.
They offer a bunch of interesting sounds.
"E-Sa-Ya" sounds more like Japanese folk music, rock, and classical.
It is not quirky at all.
X-girl is a really unique band who sings in both English and Japanese.
"Pretty You Ugly" is more punk.
This album combines pop and noise.

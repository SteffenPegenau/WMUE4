Effects and music are suppreme.
Action packed thriller.
Most of the deleted scenes shouldn't have been deleted.
The game Aladars adventure had awsome graphics and was good.
This movie has some of the best special effacts I have ever seen.
Right from the digital source.
The Carnotors roar I thought was weak but besides that nothing wrong with the sound.
Great depth, no enhancement, no dirt.
There were no lemurs at the time of the dinosaurs, raptors had feathers, there was no grass at the time, igaunadons had beaks and stood on two legs more often.
Great sound.
Great story, breath taking, good lessons in life.
I think the only big problem with this movie was its numerous scientific errors.
It has lots of bounus material to give you all the details on how these amazing effects were pulled off.
Still a good movie.
The picture was perfect.

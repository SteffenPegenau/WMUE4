I am sorry, because I wanted it to be good.
There would be something happened and some 100 pages of nothing much.
Just a lot of "explanatory" text.
This book has some magic, some characters that are moderately interesting, and very vaguely--a plot.
That list of boring books includes many of the so-called classics we were forced to read in grade school.
Strange was somewhat interesting, but that did not help much.
As far as I am concerned, it could have been half as long, and been a much better book.
Otherwise, skip it.
Mr.
I kept trying.
It was just that nothing much happened.
Even the characters were boring.
The footnotes did not bother me too much, I have seen that happen in some very good textbooks and classics.
I got three-fourths of the way through when I gave up.
But in my many years of reading, it is plainly the most boring book I have ever read.
If you enjoy long expositions of society and life and how magic is not around, then you will enjoy the book.

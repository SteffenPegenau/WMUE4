However, it is a street album.
Those who think its not real enough, get a life.
The production is solid.
Those who do will enjoy it.
He didn't seem to vary it much.
He represented all the topics he touched very well.
It varies in style but finds a way to fit to the rapper.
Could use tweaking, but good.
Ive seen its the best CD ever; great lyrics, phat beats all that or its a horrible album; commercial, unoriginal.
For you who dont like hard hip-hop, get some Nelly.
This is interesting.
To those who say it production was sloppy, boo to you.
It seems to be a love or hate album.
Just cause its not underground does not make it bad.
As far as unoriginality is concerned, it is a little lacking.
While Jada may not be as great as Biggie, he is incredible as a lyricist.
All in all, good CD.
Let me break it down.
I would have like to have heard a little better material.

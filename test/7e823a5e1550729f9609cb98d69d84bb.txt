Buy it.
I remember their single Hey Man Nice Shot a few years ago, but I believe that was their only hit song.
If you are considering this album as your next musical acquisition, go with your instincts.
Really and truly there isn't a bad song to be found.
Wow.
It took me by complete surprise that this band could play such beautiful sounding music.
Other great tracks include: The Best Things, Captain Bligh and I Will Lead You.
My knowledge of the band Filter is very limited.
Loved it.
So when their new album, Title of Record debuted a few weeks ago I didn't think much of it.
After a great deal of thought I purchased the album.
What a song.
Then a few days ago a local radio station played their new single: Take a Picture.
This is a rock album that will remain in my CD player for quite a while.
All I can say is Filter has completely outdone themselves.

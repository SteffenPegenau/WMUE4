I can wholeheartedly recommend this.
I find this music so very uplifting and nurturing.
This is not rock.
It is maybe a bit country.
It is in the genre of Coldplay, and every bit as beautiful.
Just perfect.
It makes you realise that someone else also knows the suffering that we call life.
I love the honesty of this music.
A bit folk-rock.
This is simply a compilation of drop dead beautiful songs, beautifully written and coming straight from the heart.
Or when you are alone and feeling a bit down.
I don't really know how to categorise it.
This is not heavy.
And I do not tire of it upon repeated listenings.
This woman's voice is angelic!
This is not blues.
You can play this while entertainimg, or after the party.
Bravo Sheryl Crow!

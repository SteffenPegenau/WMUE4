I had already read a few books that were quite horrible-cheap knock-offs hardly resembling the stroy I had grown to love.
Not ust the romance story but the true story.
A little over a year i went to Toronto and saw the Phantom of the Opera.
I bought it in my next order.
It made me laugh, cry, practically pull out my hair in aggravation sometimes.
IT's quite a long book, but i finished it in 2 days.
And I have read it several times since then.
So....I took a chance on this one.
Immediately after that I looked up everything on it.
This book moves you-seriously.
You won't be diappointed.
But don't take my word for it, buy it and read it.
I was mesmerized.
One day while looking for Phantom books on Amazon.com I came across this.
The reader doesn't see him as a deformed, obsessed man but as a beautiful, gifted child.
The way the author portrays Erik is just amazing.
I loved this book.

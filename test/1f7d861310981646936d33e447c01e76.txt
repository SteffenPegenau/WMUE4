I am 45 Busy Mom & working full time.
I know I will end up doing 2 twenty minute workouts back to back one of these days.
Petra is very motivating, I know it sounds silly, but, it is like she & the other girls are right there with me.
There are 4 different workouts, 2 ten minute ones & 2 twenty minute ones.
I love it!
I really like the 5 minute stretch at the end.
I am sticking with it, no problem.
I used to do Arobics years ago & loved it.
Nobody else will do it for you.
I am not bored with it at all!!
I know it will help you get back on track to a better you.
Living in Arizona I become a hermit in the summer time and this DVD gets me going after I get home from work.
I highly recommend this DVD if it has been a while since you have worked out.
After 2 weeks I am doing the 20 minute ones.
Needless to say, I put everyone before myself and it has caught up with me.
Recent issues with blood pressure and "stuff" made me realize I need to take better care of myself.

But it's been about a month ago and she hasn't touched it again.
Dora also tells a story.
The doll of Dora is removable but stiff and heavy so she doesn't carry her along.
My daughter is a huge Dora fan.
She does it over and over again.
I suppose if you buy the other dolls sold seperately, they each tell a different story.
The retail price is from $30-$40.
My 2 year old likes the twirling.
She does comb Dora's hair with the comb provided and she wears the barret.
Later, I found it for less than $10 on Amazon.
I thought it was a great deal therefore I purchased it.
But that's about it.
Overall, it was played with for about a week.
I'm not planning on buying any.
It seemed boring so decided not to buy it.
I've seen this toy in stores and tested it out.

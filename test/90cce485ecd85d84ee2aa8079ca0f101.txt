there were some good descriptions here, and there was a good deal of suspence.
they hear a baby.
something from the past haunts her.
then begins some acts of violence.
meanwhile, something about the story, seem to upset a woman with a family.
J has a fantastic self-control it seems.
ver good read
after a while they start fearing there is something [bad] about this baby.
she delivers, and goes not astray.
some kids are walking about in the woods.
i really liked this one.
many writers do very stupid things trying to be inventive, or lose interest in their story writing very stupid dialogues, e.g.
it disappears.
they see it.
J's foremost quality, i think, is that she never goes too far.

For young Girls, Grown ladies and even Men will enjoy the games.
Check out their Nancy Drew games too.
Their great for girls as well!
The other game was like all the other Dreamcatcher Games great puzzles and awsome graphics.
Syberia I've played twice once for the game and the puzzles the second time was just to view the graphics.
I own and played two of the games in this pack, I wasn't in for the pony game, not my thing as a 40 yr. old man.
If this is your first introduction to this company be warned you will be hooked.
The puzzles are thought out logical puzzles with a great story background.
I personally love Dreamcatcher games!
I can't speak for the horse game but I'm sure it's just as awsome based on my experience.
The graphics are breathtaking.
If your looking for slash em up gun toting machinegun action these are not the games for you.
I own all most the whole Dreamcatcher games.
So give them a try.
Im a Man and I enjoyed them.

The razor phone is a great phone, if you buy it from the store.
If you buy the phone on here, your taking a 50/50 chance.
The screen went blank, I replaced the battery, nothing would work.
I was trying to save money, and ordered it from here.
If you buy it, I hope your phone works better than mine did.
Just STOPPED working.
I figured things happen.
So good luck to you.
I returned it hassle free, the woman e-mailed me, was so polite, replaced my phone.
Im getting a new one, no big deal.
I ended up having to go back to the store and buy a new phone, which if I wasnt trying to be cheap in the first place, I wouldnt have ended up wasting a hundred on garbage.
(my first one got wet after having it for two years, with no problems.)
Anyway, long story short, It stopped working after a month.
The first phone I was sent came in a brand new box, everything sealed, and it didnt even work.
It was a mistake.

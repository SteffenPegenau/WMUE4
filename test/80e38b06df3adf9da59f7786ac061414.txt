My wife like the cafe crema which is just a 7 or 8 oz espresso.
So far it is outstanding!
I highly recomend this machine for the great value.
I am going on 3 months now.
I enjoy espressos frequently.
it is a velvety cup of coffee.
It is just 1 shot of espresso with hot water added.
The machine always produces a beautiful crema!
I drink cafe americano.
Cleaning is a breeze.
We make 2 different types of coffee.
I do wish the water was just slightly warmer, however as long as you heat your cup first with hot water from sink or the machine the coffee will be very hot.
I did extensive research before purchasing this automatico.
In the morning I add fresh filtered water from the refrigerator.
Once a week I take out the internal brewing gizmo (simple) and rinse it in hot water.
I just empty the spent coffee and the waste water at the end of the day.
The machine makes about 10-12 cups of coffee or espresso a day.

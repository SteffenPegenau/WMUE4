Giant bat kills NYC!
But this...oh how much worse could it get?!
I've read a book a week.
I even had one flying six inches or so one night over my pool.
I figured it would be fun to read since we have bata around my house.
Story line is a little too much!
They put so much into a book, but this should have gone in the NY garbage!
!
While I sat out reading this, I couldn't help buit find myself getting very bord.
Not a good book.
We can only hope!!
Oh you think there could be a chance!
I've read bad novels, good novels.
I hate reading negetive reviews, I always feel bad for the author.
I watch them at dusk flying eraticly.

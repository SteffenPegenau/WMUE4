But then, that's just my opinion.....
It's stupid for me to think I can restrate what's been said in 80-some reviews before me, so I'm keeping this brief.
I don't know why.
I think this album is very poor, and was a waste of my money.
Many of the reviews below give it 5 stars.
I'm beginning to think it was her peak back in 1998.
Much of it just flows along with nothing terribly interesting.
at least had some real good songs on it.
Very little stands out.
U.R.S.
OK, in my opinion this album is basically a flop.
In my opinion, just pretend this album was never released, and listen to her past two studio albums.
Lyrically it leaves a lot to be desired.
I expected much more from an artist whose proven she has a lot to offer.
About half the album was really good.
And S.F.I.J was absolutely her best album.

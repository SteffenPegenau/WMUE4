Comes with a "gift box".
(However, I did drop my PDA in this case this morning, the magnetic closure opened but the PDA stayed in place with no damage).
The magnetic closure isn't quite as strong as I'd like it to be.
All in all, I'd definitely purchase this item again, I love it!
All I can say is that all of the reviews that I read prior to buying were right on the money!
It's a little "loose" feeling.
I'm the type of consumer that likes to touch and feel before I buy.
It is fashionable looking.
I especially appreciate that it doesn't "bulk up" my PDA, it really does fit perfectly.
Comes with a nice belt clip option and tools to assemble if you choose to use it that way.

What don't I love about it?
I paid 35% less than the manufacturer on thier website.
I was a little aprehensive about buying this item without having the opportunity to check it out.
What do I love about it?
The price was a definite plus!

I don't know.
The end of friendship thing lasted, like, two pages.
It was pretty funny, but it's not the type of book that keeps you guessing until the end.
It's basically about a girl named Lula finding out about herself.
then go ahead.
But PLEASE don't waste your money.
It was fun to read but not really enlighting.
It could have been a lot better.
I've read sooooooo many better spring break books.
Ok, this book was funny, entertainable, and predictable.
But, she doesn't change from self concious to a wild woman.
If you want to check it out of a lib.
There was no tragic break-up with a happy reunion.
Yet, I must admit, this wasn't the worst.
I think that they could have edited it a little more and added more of a plot twist.

This 13 song album has a bit of everything.
has grown but how amazing they're going to be in the future.
With each listen the songs get better and better.
Scarling.
has taken huge steps forward since Sweet Heart Dealer and I believe they have really found their true and unique sound.
or JOJ fans.What are you waiting for?
So Long, Scarecrow is full of emotion, distorition, and beautiful vocals from the truly amazing Jessicka.
I think this album not only shows how much Scarling.
GO BUY IT!
I would recommend this album to anyone, this is a must have for any Scarling.
:P
So Long, Scarecrow is a work of art.
could pull off.
It's one of the best and most addiciting albums I've ever owned.
I found the songs truly catchy, original, and full of depth nobody but Scarling.

I was on the edge of my seat as I watched this movie in the theatre even after the 4th time.
It's good none the less.
And nothing makes a fan boy more mad than straying from the game storyline.
Well for two reasons: One, the director totally strayed from the video game story line.
I got a little disturbed in the end when she was wearing that lovely hospital gown.But don't let that stop you from purchasing this great movie.
And this movie was mainly bent on the pleasing the fan boys.
And seccond: All the Milla fanboy pleasing scenes were not needed at all.
What can I say?
I loved this one.
And what really surprised me was how clean and tame it was.
So I was very impressed by that.Why did I give it only 4 stars you ask?
Yes, I saw it 4 times in the theatre.
Granted there were some gross scenes but I was expecting all-out gory-bloody messes left and right like the movie.
Excellent movie altogether.
Nice storyline, character developement.

Preferably MLB 2001.
How many times has a baseball fan been proved wrong in a real game about this one?
If you want a game with all the gusto and less hype buy a baseball game from 989Sports.
MLB 2001 is one the best new games of the season.
It's the best game currently for the playstation.
The players stance, movement, and catch ability is greatly improved.
Die Hard baseball fans have it all wrong about this one.
PLAY ON!
"Same dance, just a different tune."
The buttons work the same to control the movements of players, which is one of the greatest plus's.
It has great improvements.
All I can say is,give it a try.
Forget the twisted views and purchase MLB 2001 from 989sports.
Believe me, I have played them.
Let the baseball fan of the opposing team take all heat.
Disappointment is for the mental-case baseball fan whom believes everything is currently perfect in baseball stats to predict a baseball game's outcome.
No work needed here.

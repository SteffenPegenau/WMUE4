the fan in my opinion IS NOT LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just a quick note,,,i did mention that it moves air nicely.
it does look nice though.
It is very nicely put together.
it arrives needing assembly.
Not sure if id recommend this fan at this price.
took me about 20 minutes.
the base of it makes it heavy.
its very rigid and strong feeling.
it seems you have to be right on top of it to feel it.
it oscillates,has low medium and high settings.
very easy.
on the heavy side.
higher setting is slightly better.
it moves air nicely.
This Hunter Century model fan is all one could ever need in a higher priced fan.
On the low setting it is very weak,.
I have noticed that it really does'nt.

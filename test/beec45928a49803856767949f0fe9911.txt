So we can fail again.
Perfect.
Restoring a church, which Jesus Christ and God himself founded at Christ's birth, was this not revelation.
That it is a Cult.
Who are you to tell anyone that a church restored in Jesus Christ's name is not Christian.
Employers ask of their employees to be the best.
Why?
To be perfect?
Or are we never able to attain perfection?
Is not that what God wants of us?
Who are you to tell anyone that their relationship with the Holy Spirit is not revelation.
It seems funny that we ask our children to improve in school, to get A's.
For what?
James R. White downplays a very fundimental belief of the LDS, that with centuries of time and tests of our inner spirit we can become as god.
Is there no growth to the point of perfection.
Is that our reward?
Hum.
How easy it is to be that perfect.
Revelation is fundimental to all mankind.

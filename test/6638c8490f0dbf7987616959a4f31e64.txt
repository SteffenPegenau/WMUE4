Tyne Daly is absolutely perfect in the role created for the brash belter, Ethel Merman.
Ethel Merman5.
But Tyne's renditions of this powerful and popular score are phenomenal.
As long as you don't mind the sound of Tyne's "sick" voice, which is only bad in certain spots, I say get this recording.Gypsy Recordings to Buy:1.
Angela Lansbury4.
It beats out Bernadette Peters' and Angela Lansbury's versions.
Tyne Daly2.
I personally find Merman's songs empty and hollow.
Bette Midler's TV movie
So this album is not a true mirror of what her performance was.
Absolutely Perfect!
Her voice was hoarse and coarse when this CD was recorded because she was very ill at the time.
But even through her illness, you get the emotion and pain in Rose's songs.
Bernadette Peters3.
Her "Rose's Turn" is simply the best ever.

So were the GO-GO's.
I should have reviewed this along with FM.
Both are excellent time capsules of what radio was playing.
Jackson Browne, Joe Walsh, Don Henley are each awful.
When the best songs are by Billy Squier and Sammy Hagar you know you're in trouble.
I almost fell asleep in route 128 traffic when Graham Nash played.
This song rocks and Danny Elfman sounds crazed.
This is the terrible soundtrack.
There were some listenable tracks by Timothy B. Schmit, Louise Goffin and Stevie Nicks but then there's Quarterflash.
The band that called themselves Poco can't be the same Poco I grew up with.
Both represented youth.
One was a bad movie with a great soundtrack and the other was a classic movie with a terrible soundtrack.
Unavailable anywhere else which saves this from the trash.
Both were double record hit soundtracks.
However, amongst all this crap was a gem...the very last song is Goodbye Goodbye by Oingo Boingo.
Not surprisingly Don Felder and Jimmy Buffet both sucked.

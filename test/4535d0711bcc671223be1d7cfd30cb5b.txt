His true spirit comes through.
His adventure's in the islands north of Australia were the highlight for me.
Errol is also a excellent writer.
What a Life!
Cruel, yes, but a part of history.
Let's just say, Errol was no angel.
This man has scene some things.
But a product of his times I guess.
He comes across as a honest man about who he is, good or bad.
The world needs more deep thinkers.
Picture a different time period where white man was the king.
Errol had his ups and downs, but what a adventure.
Minus the way he treated the natives, I found Errol to be a good soul who was honest with himself about his short comings.
He comes up with some really well written sentences along the way.
If the words in this book are mostly true, I like the man.
Very well written book, and I would definitely recommend it.

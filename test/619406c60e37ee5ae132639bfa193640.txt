I probably won't ever watch it again.
The best song is what they play with the credits.
I had a little trouble following who was who at times.
Basically, Madonna plays a woman who is assaulted and gets her army of lovers to get revenge on the guy.
The music is not bad, actually.
I think there were 2 guys that looked alike, not sure if it was two different guys or not.
I found it at...TOPS!
You get to see Madonna's [...] a few times.
The audio sucks, the film is dark and grainy, as others have stated.
At the end, in the credits, we learn Madonna's full name.
The reason I got this was because it's considered a rare item.
LOL.
What an...interesting DVD.
[...] I heard about this movie on a VH1 or MTV special on Madonna.
My friends took away my "gay license" because I didn't already know it (Madonna Louise Cicconi).
You can tell this movie was independent.
This is NOT a spoiler, but the end of the film gets NASTY!
It's only an hour long, which seems like too much at times.

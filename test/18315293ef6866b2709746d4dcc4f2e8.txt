I had to pay for shipping, HOWEVER, it was going to cost me over $12 JUST FOR RETURN SHIPPING COST.
But I had no choice.
I would have had to pay MORE than I paid when I bought it.
Not as described.
DISAPPOINTED was the look of recipient.
Some items cannot be returned.
Lesson learned some of these descriptions are not quite honest.
Was quality of cheaper toy.
I paid over $12 for the set, not counting the $6 for shipping.
When I advised I had originally paid $6 for shipping why was it more than doubled to return shipping cost.
When I saw the set I tried to return it.
So I had to reluctantly keep the set.
I was told that sellers usually had set cost with whoever ships for them.
Will be more selective with sellers.
That was the reaction when gift was opened.
Was suppose to be for 6yrs and up, not at all.
I lesson that cost me over $18.

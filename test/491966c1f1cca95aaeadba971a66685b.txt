To add insult to injury, the second disc has an AUDIO ONLY of the concert!
You can't even play it in a standard cd player.
Also on this dvd, the interviews are only from current band members.
What a waste!
It's basically just extremely boring interviews.
This may be the worst Yes dvd since Keys To Ascension.
But for some reason, they didn't do that.
While it's playing, it just shows still shots of the band.
In the interviews, the band is pretty much repeating all they've said in the Yesyears video.
They said it better years ago on that video.
The ONLY reasons to buy this dvd is if you've never seen Yesyears, or if you've never heard anything Yes did before 2000.
They could have easily shown the concert on one disc and had all the interviews on the other disc.
Only in the dvd player.
Whose lame idea was this?
What the hell?
And hosted by Roger Daltry?
This dvd is just pathetic!
You won't see people like Trevor Rabin, Tony Kaye, or Bill Bruford anywhere.

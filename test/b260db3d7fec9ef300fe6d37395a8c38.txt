Is there anything better?
I did find our evil lord Dracula was dressed somewhat silly though.
Ahhhhhhh mindless action.
Now we're talking!!
Though her ties to Whisler were confusing... but whatever.
I'll have to say this 3rd attempt was a lot better than the 2nd Blade.
The thing with Blade that drew me in so well, was it was a very well put together action movie, but it also had a not too bad story-line.
Cheers!
Jessica Beil was very cool.
He looked like an out of time rocker ... lol.
Ryan Renolds (ya canada!)
brought some much wanted humor and resolve to us.
All in all, it's a good rent ... or buy to complete your Blade collection.
Granted, it's not Good Will Hunting story calliber, but it's ok none the less.
Well... how about action mixed in with a good story?

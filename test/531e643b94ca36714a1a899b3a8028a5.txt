The LAPD and FBI sure do.
I was there and so was Steve.
I was an associate of Mickey's.
Few in the public know who I am.
I highly recommend this book.
Steve was respectful of my privacy and kept me out of his book.
As far as the review where the mook said Steve was being self indulgent, I have something to say.
Anton Giordano Hosney.
Steve's book captures the mood of that time and how Mickey operated.
And so does Steve.
Thanks Steve, you were always a stand up guy.
His book took me back to those times.
You are all wet pal.
Steve pretty much nailed what his relationship was with Mickey.
I am 80 yrs old and knew Steve when he was running with "our crew".

So that's weird that it's so much more expensive now.
(I have the pink one because it supports breast cancer).The clips also didn't hold very well.
See that girl who posted 2 pictures, one w/ curly hair and one w/ straightish hair?
The straight hair is what my hair looked like AFTER I left the curlers in for 15 minutes.
Some of the pieces DIDN'T fall out, and even they didn't curl.)
(it's still $22.77 @ Walmart.
(I have naturally straight, thick hair.)
(Don't think, "Oh, that's why it didn't curl her hair!"
Pieces of my hair kept falling out of the curlers.
because that's not true.
This is weird, because my hair is normally really easy to curl, and it stays until I wet my hair.
They made my hair SLIGHTLY wavy.
)Anyways, these didn't curl my hair.
I bought this the other day and they were $22.77 w/ Prime Shipping.
My favorite curling iron is Conair's infiniti curling wand.
And now it says almost $8 shipping, and $29.99.

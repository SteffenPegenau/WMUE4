This DeLonghi model is not reliable.
But mine just quit today and I would hate for someone else to have this trouble.
You're lucky if you get a good machine that lives past the warranty.
Before you think I don't know what I am doing, I know how to reset the brew counter.
My machine is only 5 months old.
But the coffee just won't brew.
This worked once before but this time its just not responding.
Cheers!
No water passes through the system and the hot plate is cold.
Good luck, if you get this as a gift, I hope you have no problems.
Come on, it supposed to work for much longer than that.
That's why I titled this "lights on but no coffee brewing"I liked this figaro machine for all its features.
The power light and 5-10 cup light come on.
I re-read the manual and I pushed both the prog and power buttons simultaneously for 2-5 seconds.
For 150 dollars or more, there has to be more reliable machines out there!

Non-stop entertainment, rock's greatest voice, oldest teenager, and coolest frontman.
DVD concert of the century!
The Waboritas are without question his best band.
Sit back, grab some tequila, and enjoy over 2 hours of pure rock and roll bliss.
You won't be disappointed.
The Red Rocker is timeless.
Sorry DLR, this stuff is way out of your league!!!
This is a must for all fans of music.
Vic Johnson is soooo cool.
Cheers.
I loved Van Halen but the solo material is so much more passionate and real.
The interview disc is very enjoyable also.
Nobody rocks better than Sammy.
Sammy's repertoire of material speaks for itself in this performance.
It would have been nice to see "3 In The Middle" included, but nevertheless this concert shreds!

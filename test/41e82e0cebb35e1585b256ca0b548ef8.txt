The music is just really awesome.
The story line is somewhat similar to rurouni kenshin¡s yet it still has a story of its own.
Well it gets greater every episode.
I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do!
Samurai Deeper Kyo!
It¡s definitely a five star anime!
There¡s something for everybody.
The animation is top notch.
WOW!!!!
What can I say!
There¡s romance, sword fights, ninjas, comedy, drama and much much more.
Like I said, this is something for everyone and even if you don¡t like samurais and fighting, you¡ll definitely enjoy this series!!!
The characters are well developed and drawn so superbly.
[...].
I¡ve said enough so now that you heard so much about it, go out and buy it!

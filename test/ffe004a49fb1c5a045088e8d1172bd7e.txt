First of this trike is very well built.
They have a VERY small picture ofthe parts.
I just put them together according to the picture.
If anyone has a trick for putting those buggers on please share!!!
I told her my difficulties and the parts I broke and the stickers on the seatwere coming off and they are sending me out replacement parts tomorow.
The stickers on the seat, they were coming off when I got it out of the box.
The wheels have that small metal cap that fits over the metal axel.
Worth the money.
They don't give a name for the parts.
It came with an extra, I broke both trying to get them on.
My complaints.......
Here's the real shocker, the instructions have the real wheel assembly backwards from the picture of the bike.
Instructions are alwful.
So during assembly you have know idea what they're talking about.
I called the company up and they said they are working on shipping them out with better instructions.

I had seen it on television so I knew it had been cut.
No complaints about the quality of the DVD.
I only really liked The Hitman, out of the three movies.
I didn't purchase it here.
Everybody has different taste in movies.
I don't remember ever watching any of these movies, so I don't know if they cut scenes out of them.
It isn't that I don't like Chuck Norris, I like some of his movies.
The quality of the picture wasn't to hot either!
I returned it.
I wouldn't say that I disliked the other two.
I'm sure other people would disagree.
As far as I can tell it is a good transfer.
I've seen some movies that wasn't recorded very well.
I just found them so-so.
Sound was fine.
Good picture.
I had a movie I purchased once and it didn't have all of the scenes in it.

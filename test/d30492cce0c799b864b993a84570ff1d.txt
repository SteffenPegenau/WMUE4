EVERYONE in the theatre had this "What the heck is this?!"
It KNEW that having Tom Green swing a dead baby around the room by it's umbilical cord would make people question their own ethics for seeing it.
Yes, its plot and acting was thin.
This, is what they were striving to do.
The whole thing was so absurd, that I turned around to see other's reactions.
It KNEW that the acting was bad.
And that... is why I loved it.
call me unintelligent, but if you look at the movie as a ethic breaker, you may agree.
Thats why it was so wonderful.
but in a way, it was a revolutionary movie.
look on their face.
The film make so little sense, that it bordered on genius.
Watch with open mind.
Im sure they all hated the movie.
So many recent gross-out comedies have completely missed what they were striving to do.
because it KNEW that it's plot was thin.

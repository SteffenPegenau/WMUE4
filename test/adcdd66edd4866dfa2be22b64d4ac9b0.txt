What's next, polkas?
Wow, standards records are ALL the rage!"
B.B.
Well, all this CD will do is make B.B's fans rage.
You can just hear the imbeciles at the label: "Rod Stewart did it, Linda Ronstadt did it.
What dunderhead empty suit came up with this idea?
The reason "Reflections" isn't selling at all is because (all together now) NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR THIS KIND OF STUFF ANY MORE.
King, a national icon, singing non-blues.
If I was B.B.
There's not enough blues around these days, so what do we get?
Two stars only because it's B.B.
King, I'd fire my manager and get somebody in there who knows what he's doing.
King, America's greatest blues singer, crooning a bunch of standards just shows the kind of inept decisions that today's record labels make.
The very concept of B.B.
Brilliant!

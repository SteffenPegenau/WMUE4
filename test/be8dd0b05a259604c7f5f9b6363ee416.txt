It works!
I love it.
If using for headache take care not to get in eyes.
I woke with no headache!
It helps tremendously!
This cream has saved me from lots of pain.
Well worth the money in my opinion!
I bought the 16 oz.
jar for me and one for my near 80 year old mom.
I was skeptical when my aging mom told me about it.
Wonderful!
I even have used it on my sinus area.
It warms the skin but does not burns like other creams of this type.
I use it on my joints for arthritis pain.
Sinus meds were not working.
This did the trick.

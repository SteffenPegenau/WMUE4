Production: My band's four track tapes sound better than this.
Here is why this is *NOT* worth your money:1.
It's not raw or powerful, it sounds like they took an old tape recorder and went to a garage to produce this.4.
Lyrics: Why, God, why?5.
PLEASE, there are so many other more worthy cd's you could buy.
Vocals: James has lost all aggression in his voice.
How about the new Haunted, or perhaps the Devin Townsend Band's latest?
This is certainly not the Metallica I know.2.
NONE.
He is past his prime.I could go on and on, but really, is there any need?
Guitars: As many have noted, there are NO leads or solos on this album.
Drums: What is Lars playing, a garbage can?
I listen to black metal, and I still find this unbearable!
How could a once-great band like Metallica put out such a lackluster release?
I mean, seriously, these guys are multi-millionaires, can't they afford real drums?3.
The riffs are identical to anything you would hear on the radio: downtuned and overly simplistic.

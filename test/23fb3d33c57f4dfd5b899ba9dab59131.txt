Start at the beginning.
This is the only show that I have religiously watched on television for years now.
She makes pizza towers and watches really bad movies over and over again.
Is there a better fictional woman out there?And, don't even get me started on Luke, Suki, Rory...etc etc.If you loved Northern Exposure like I did, there is something familiar here.
You'll love them while you want to strangle them....just like family.If you haven't watched the show, start here.
She completely loves her kid.
She messes things up with men...a lot.
She keeps her sense of humor through it all.
This is some of the most superb writing on television.I love Lorelei.
Watch things unfold, grow, change.
The cast of characters is both eccentric and eclectic.
It's not hard to explain why.
She'd be my friend.
The town is small.
It's worth your time.
She's strong and smart.

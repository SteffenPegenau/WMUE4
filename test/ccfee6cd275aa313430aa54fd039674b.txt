and that simply .... i mean, lets think about it, only true true fans of jackass would spend $$ on dvds of episodes still airing on tv correct?
but im severly dissapointed.
even though it wasn't that funny, it truly marked the end of jackass.
and, guess what, it's not included.
maybe i'll find all the epsidoes somewhere.
WELL GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT.
like a true fan should.
including the meter fairy, daddy and baby, dog vs. bunny (pontius), wrecking ball, they cut blindfolded skateboarding in half completely forgeting the funny part.
oh well.
the videos are only like 75 minutes each.
and huge dissapointment and rip off.3.
1. its edited.
there are less than half the episodes.
they cut out so many funny skits.
NOT COOL PARAMOUNT AND MTV.. NOT COOL.2.
human bbq.. please man that was classic and they didn't include it.
i was in awe when the first ... word was a long bleep.
imagine that.overall, i gave it 3 stars, because what i'm forced to deal with is great.
no gumball rally.

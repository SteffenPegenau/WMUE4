The music is both conventional and eerie.
This is Stanley Kubrick's best film.
Bleak,Ironic,and perversely funny.
A two part film,the first dealing with a marine bootcamp,and the second centering on Vietnam during the 1968 Tet Offensive.
The last image of the marines walking through a burned out city is both bizzare and unforgettable.
Making the viewer feeling a bit let down.
This film offers little hope & even less humanity.
The film's climax is both suspenseful and very haunting.
You tend to feel numb as it fades into the second half.
But I think that was the intent.
The film shows a surreal view of combat.
The first part, is the most riveting pieces of film I've ever seen.
Stanley Kubrick's (full metal jacket) is based from Gustav Hasford's gory & obscure novel (short-timers).
Superb direction,cinematography,acting, and great sound, ( the sounds of distant explosions & gunfire) are just one example.
I'ts not as strong as the first, it's a bit detached and unstructured.

I bought this movie at a place in city.
And what was that thing about the atomic satellite?
A man who invent a machine that can record real life and insert it's memories into another human, and the US govenment trying to find it?
It wasn't mentioned so much in the movie.
And what IS the plot?
He did not consider research what would happen until the real 1999.
First, I think Wim Wenders did put this movie too close to his own time.
For their own purposes?
You do not get to see the plot real close.
And it didn't went up to my expectetions.
I recommend seing Blade Runner if you want to see a future thriler/sci-fi.Mind that this is MY rating for this movie, and should not be taken seriously.
Thank You.
You can see that the Soviet Union is actually still intact, even though it ceased to exist the coming year.
I watched it.
Secondary, much of the picture was too much centered on Clarie (Solveig Dommartin).

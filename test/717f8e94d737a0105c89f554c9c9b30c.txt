It keeps my daughter's attention at bedtime and soothes her.
It does not play music.
This is a sure winner with ages baby - 10.
The stars and moon are bright and the different color options ensure you can find a color that will be bright in any room.
It is the best nightlight ever.
I got this for my daughter when we were having a new baby since they'd be sharing a room and my daughter always kept a light on.
The stars don't move.
It's not supposed to.
My daughter's friend has the turtle at home and since she saw our ladybug has been bugging her mom for one.
Our fave is purple.
The baby, now a toddler, fell in love with it, so here I am buying our second.
Where are you people getting your info?
This was one of the best kids' purchases I've made in a while.
My daughter usually has to press it once more before falling asleep.
We've had it for almost 2 years now and have only had to change the batteries 3 times and that's with daily use.

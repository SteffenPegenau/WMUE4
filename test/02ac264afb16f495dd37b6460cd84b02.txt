How can you put it in the same category?
I am somewhat in awe it has the high ratings it does.
Have you people seen Blazing Saddles, AIRPLANE!
was written and rewritten for years before it was made into a full fledged B movie.
Remember the script for AIRPLANE!
I can't honestly give any of the episodes on TV five stars except the Hunting episode, "BIRD!
", and this movie certainly isn't going to get 5 either.
I assume you have enough cash now that you will do it for artistic license and not simply to cash in
But for the most part .... for the most part the vulgarity is simply another aspect of a degenerate culture.
The intro song is good, I will give it that.
Anyway, to dissect it.
In my own opinion this movie is nowhere near Blazing Saddles, AIRPLANE!, or The Blues Brothers.
Please take your time on the next one.
or The Blues Brothers?
Saddam and Satan are funny.
Cartman has a few good lines throughout as usual.
You guys can do better and you know it.

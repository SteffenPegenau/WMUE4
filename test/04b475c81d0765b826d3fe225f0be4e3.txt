Bobby is great, but the supporting cast is awesome.
The recorded sound is rich and detailed.
I was not familiar with Albert Stinson, the bassist, but he has a beautiful, fat sound, much like Bob Cranshaw.
Some avant garde - 'Oblique' and 'Bi-Sectional'.
At any rate, musically and sonically, 'Oblique' is a treasure.
This is a great album from the master of the vibes.
Some beautiful sounds - 'Til Then', 'My Joy'.
What a tragedy that he died shortly after this recording.
It has it all.
I put it up there with Hank Mobley's 'Soul Station' as far as sound quality.
Herbie Hancock as always, is fantastic.
Joe Chambers provides the drive on drums, and also contributes a couple of fine compositions - 'Oblique' and 'Bi-Sectional'.
This is one of the best 'RVG' editions.
And that is another thing.
Maybe because it was a quartet too and there is more 'space' for the individual instruments.

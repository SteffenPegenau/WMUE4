It is one of my favorite science fiction films, hands down.But the Unrated Director's Cut?
Are almost non-existent.
Is a waste of money.
No, neither of those.
More cussing?
The additions to the film were so few and so subtle, I barely noticed them.
There's nothing on this DVD that I didn't get on the first one, except some hype about the sequel, and not even that was very convincing.
I loved the theatrical release of Pitch Black.
More violence?
And the extras?
I bought the Unrated Director's Cut of this film with great anticipation.
At least it has the theatrical trailers.
The Unrated part?
Not noticeably.
Seriously, if you already own this film on DVD, don't waste your money on this reissue.If you don't own this film on DVD, see if you can find the original release.
More bare skin?

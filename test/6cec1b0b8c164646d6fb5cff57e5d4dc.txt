Make up your mind which is it?
The worst Marah cover.Track 10: Cry Baby 9/10.
It's on the wrong album.Track 7: Heartbreaker 5/10.
The first being "Emotions.
A sweet song.Track 3: Bliss 2/10.
!Track 12: Petals 9/10.
Mariah, please no more interludes!Track 9: Against All Odds 1/10.
Half Mariah song, Half Mystikal song.
Sounds like "My All" part 2.Track 6: X-Girlfriend 2/10.
It's too long, plus it's a very weak song.Track 4: How Much 2/10.
Sounds like something from 1996.Track 5: After Tonight 3/10.
I really like this one.Track 11: Did I Do That 3/10.
"Track 1: Heartbreaker 10/10.
But Missy Elliott and Da Brat are funny like always.Track 8: Vulnerability 1/10.
Very personal.Track 13: Rainbow 1/10 Mariah, please nooooooo interludes!Track 14: Thank God I Found You 10/10.
The best song on the album.Track 2: Can't Take That Away 9/10.
The second best song on the album.
I hate this remix.

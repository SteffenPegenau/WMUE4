DO NOT BUY AN INFINITY unless you don't mind wasting your money.
I was only able to vacuum my living room and small hallway and again the red light.
I then vacuumed my living room, which is an average size and the red light came on again.
I decided to end this nightmare and I purchased another Hoover vacuum today.
So I washed out the cylinders, which requires patience and effort.
After using it a couple of times, I noticed the red light blinking.
It is unusable unless I somehow tape it together.
Ten months after purchasing this vacuum, the handle where you push and pull the vacuum broke.
In about four months the suction decreased.
I am guessing that dirt collected somewhere else.
This happened several times after I emptied it.
I purchased the Infinity ahnd thought it was a fantastic vacuum.
I emptied the dust collector.
Conclusion: You don't get to vacuum much before you have to clean the cylinders.
It sucked up dirt better than my Hoover Windtunnel.

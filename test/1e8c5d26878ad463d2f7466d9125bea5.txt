I reread it several times looking for the answer, but I'm still at a loss.
It seemed like the story just stopped.
These 2 people are portrayed as too "perfect."
He was perfect, she was perfect, their children were perfect, their home was perfect, their lifestyle was perfect, their faces & bodies were perfect, their relationship was perfect... Whew!
I've concluded that the narrator died at that moment, but that's not so according to my friends.
I found the story engaging, but not very believable.
Perhaps THAT is what Sparks intended?
To keep us guessing & wondering & drawing our own conclusions??
I closed the book dazed & confused.
?
Maybe I'm cynical, but I got tired of all the "mush & gush."
Give me a break.
This debate has been the most interesting part of reading this book... wondering what on earth Nicholas Sparks is describing there at the end - death or new life?
My book club is in a heated debate over this.
It didn't end.

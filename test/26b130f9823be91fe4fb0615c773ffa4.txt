I got this to boost the signal from the cable company in my home.
Until they raise the cable prices again...
So, I am not using them now.
I don't know if that's true or not but I'm loving my cable company right now.
A few months later the cable company came to my home and asked to check my signal.
Wow.
I heard that they don't boost the full spectrum of the cable bandwidth but act like a bell curve on their boost.
The cable company didn't charge anything either.
It helped a little more.
While it did help some channels some didn't really get better.
So, i put another way down the line.
So I don't know if the booster did it's job or not.
They can in and took the boosters out and replaced a cable splitter (probably the root of the problem) hooked up to their computer and everything comes in great on all the TV's.
I have a bunch of TV's and not all got a good picture and all the channels didn't come in.
They said there was some signal problems and traced it to my line.

This is the best movie ever made.
It was a fantastic outstanding movie and I recommend buying it.
Now I can't wait for the next one to come out.
So he goes on this big jouney to destroy it.
Later he has to give it up.
His nephew Frodo gets the ring.
So go out and buy it.
He finds out the dark lord is bound to it and that the ring is evil.
"three rings for the elven kings under the sky,seven for the dwarfs in their halls of stone,nine for the mortal men doomed to die,one for the dark lord on his dark throne,in Mordor where the shadows lie,one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them,one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them,in Mordor where the shadows lie."
It's all about this ring that was created by this dark lord.
If I could I would give it ten stars.
In a battle the ring gets cut off of his hand and he dies.
Then the ring gets lost for a while and a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins finds it.
I loved it.
When I saw the movie I had to read the books.

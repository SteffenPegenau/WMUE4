It was cheaper at Amazon.com than walmart, but It took forever to get.
Plus, nothing was labeled, and you had to figure out what pieces were what.
When caption said ships 5-7 days.
Plus, the shelves inside the unit are WHITE, the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white.
When I called the company, (which I was on hold for 30 minutes) then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken (5) that we needed to return it.
Than when we did get it, several pieces were broken.
It is not worth the problems.
Another mth.
Major pieces.
It took two weeks for us to get it.
I called the company and they said this is true.
I told them no, it's over 100 lbs and I am 7mth preg.
So it took almost 2 mths to get this product.
they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in 4 weeks.
I would not reccomend this product.

Or Tasha Tilberg just standing there.
Kristen Owen and her show stealing "out of the shower" look.
Just interesting.
Photography doesn't need to be about art.
And interesting this book is.
You get the sense he more wanted to publish a book of many of the current top models(Fall of 1999).
Milla looking like she just woke up.
Over forty pages!

Worth checking out if you like fashion.
Whether it's Devon Aoki thinking she's the Venus.
But all beautiful.
Not much of a theme (aside from nude models).
And not so in making a photographic statement.The photos are also developed in a very pale (annoying) form.
Well over 30 different models!
Too bad really.
Audrey Marnay and her over-exaggerated scared expression.
Beautiful current top models.. who can you go wrong?
Where Paolo lacks a theme, the models improvise, some better than others.

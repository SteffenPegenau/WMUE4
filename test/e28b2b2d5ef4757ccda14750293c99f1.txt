I agree that the DVD commentary was excellent, but this was NOT a scary movie.
A good film, unique (that's for sure), and overall enjoyable to watch.
Having read all the wonderful reviews of "Freaks" I just had to get it.
But scary?
Yes, the use of actual "freaks" in the movie was fascinating, but it surely didn't make us run for the OFF switch on our DVD player.
I warned my wife before we watched that the film was (allegedly) incredibly disturbing, grotesque and frightening.
No way!
Not even close.
Don't get me wrong--it's a very interesting movie.
Let's just say that we didn't even bat an eyelash.
Weren't circus sideshows more prevelant in the 1930's than now?
Really tame.
So what's the big deal?
I am frankly shocked it was allegedly banned anywhere at any time.
But I don't see it as a landmark horror flick.
Considering the reviews, the movie was actually quite tame.

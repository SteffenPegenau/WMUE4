I hope they come out with one.
I found that it hit upon the pertain side effects and interactions, and I liked the organization.
This book presents the facts concisely without a lot of fluff.
I found it to be excellent.
And, its cheaper.
It is a little old now, and is certainly over-due for a new edition.
I used it as a supplement to my class notes and pharmcards to study for pharmacology.
It is a good book.
Mechanism of action descriptions were adequate for nearly all questions I was asked.
Give it a shot.
I was one of the few people in my medical school class that liked this book.
But, they weren't #1 in their class for both Pharm I and Pharm II in medical school.
Most in my class used the Lippicontt Illustrated Reviews Pharmacology book.
I like the outline format.
I was.
I used it in addition to FirstAid to study for the boards.

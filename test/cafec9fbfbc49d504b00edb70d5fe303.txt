Definately.
Sound familiar, of course it's just like the plot in the book!.
Worth Buying?
I disagree.
Yes.
Extremely funny?
Some have said that to start reading Martin Amis, other books like Money or Success would be better.
The characterisation of the books sort-of-hero, Charles Highway is fascinating, and he dissects the typical foibles of an adolescent with skill and integrity.
Other high points include the amazing vocabulary that the book is written with.
The Rachel Papers is a brilliantly funny introduction to the writings of one of the strangest and most talented British Novelists.
Without a doubt.
Self-Obsessed?
The outstanding prose makes me (excuse me) laugh out loud every time I read it and almost makes up for some of the unconvincing aspects of the plot.
Martin Amis went to Exeter College, Oxford and lived before that with his father in a village in Oxfordshire.
Autobiographical?
Martin Amis' first novel shows hints of true genius.
Yes.

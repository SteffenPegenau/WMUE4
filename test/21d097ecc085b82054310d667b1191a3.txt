So one day when I was bored I decided to look up anew book to Kindle.
At least thats not sick.
Okay it wasmt her usual historical romance with a young 20 something heroine but, whatever, I gave it a shot.
I am a fan of Beatrice Small and have read alot of her stuff.
And I'm all for a good love scene, but that was sick filth.
This one looked good!
First of all, do you know what "The Channel" is?
Boy, do I regret wasting $7.
its a sci-fi romance!
A tv channel.
Not romantic at all... sick.
This should be flagged as porn for people who dont want to read filth like this.
SICK.
So, that, combined with the dumb premise are very good reasons to stick with Beatrive Small's historical romance.
Thats right, she put her hand up to the tv screen and was instantly 100 pounds and had a gorgeous man.

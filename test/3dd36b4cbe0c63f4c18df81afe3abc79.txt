Initially when it came, i was surprised by how light this box was.
The wood kept splintering and falling apart.They claim this box is tuned to 30 hz.
They sent me T-bolts which i installed as instructed.
I was robbed of $120 by buying this box.
Maybe i just got a defective box; but the build quality is awful.
However over time (just 3-4 weeks) the condition of the box deteriorated.
But this box is awful and i wish i hadnt bought it.save by building your own
My other box was solid and heavy.I had the sub in for 1 day, the sub fell out of the box b/c the screws wouldnt hold.
Though im not saying R/T is a bad company.
I paid 120 for this box.
That is not true.
I've owned their other products and loved them.
And worse of all, when you bump it loud you can see the box actually flexing (it shouldnt do that).
They advertise it as 3/4 MDF material used; but it was so light I could pick it up with one hand.
I complained to R/T staff who were very quick to respond and helpful.

The flash doesn't seem to need lots of time to adjust to what your shooting.
For some reason the black model was $20 cheaper.
I'd prefer a camera a to be a little larger, which is the only reason I've rated it a 4 instead of 5.
The stability control also seems to work great.
Saves movies to AVI.
I've taken zoomed pictures with great success as well.
This camera makes me glad to pony up the extra cash for something more "useable".
The battery {included} charged rather quickly and I was off to play.
Video w/microphone works great thus far.
Have only had this camera for a day, so my knowledge of it is limited.
My last camera being a POS 3.1 mp, Walmart special.
Out of the box this camera takes excellant pictures.
It is an easy camera to just point and shoot.
Low light pictures turn out great.
While the camera is rather small, it feels solid in hand.
Honestly, I preferred the look of the black model.

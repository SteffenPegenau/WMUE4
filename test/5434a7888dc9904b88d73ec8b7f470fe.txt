I discovered the Fugs retroactively from the Mothers of Invention and the Velvets.
They never had the pretty folk-rock harmonies or mainstream potential of the Byrds, Love, Jefferson Airplane.
The lyrics are just as topical now as they were during Vietnam.
It's punk before anyone ever thought of the term.
Get this and the first.
They were throwbacks to the Beats, whose influence I was too young for, and too radical for most post-Beatlemaniacs.
The music is minimal.
Nothing has changed in 40+ years.
However, the first and second Fugs albums have stuck with me because they were singing about big issues, silly juvenilia schtick, and poetry.
Or sadly.
The singers, well, can't.
Mayhem.
RIP Tuli.
Ironically.
I bought this album in my youth based on "Kill for Peace."
There's poetry.
Good stuff for those who like their garage rock cerebral.

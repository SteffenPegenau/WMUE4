Lots of inputs.
Why not bind each language seperately?
I really like that the black triangle area below the display on the 328w was dropped for a clean even straight bezel.
The hidden speakers produce great sound.
Only power/miniplug audio/antenna cables provided.
Why fix what wasn't broken?
WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?
Very nice clean lines.Weaknesses: BLUE LIGHT SPECIAL!
Strengths: Excellent picture and amazing sound.
Previous version didn't have this DUMB design.
Guess designers never put one in a bedroom.
Light around power switch illuminates whole dark room when off!
Manual is quite thorough, and an inch thick and heavy due to multilanguages.
DUMB DESIGN: BRIGHT blue circle light around power switch makes set look like a cheap gamebox.
Universal Remote is a big plus.
Built-In HD tuner.
Manual in multilanguages is very large.Summary: Yes, screen is beautiful and sound is much better than prior lnr328w version.

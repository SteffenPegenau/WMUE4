You'd be better off reading some of those.

Boring.
I could care less about girls shopping and altering clothing or the arrival of a pet kitten.
I realize all three points are the same but it is such an important one I feel I must repeat it.
This book leads you to believe it is a romance set in the South Pacific and will take place during the war.

I have read almost every book written by Lori Wick and I think her latest ones are just not that great.
I look for books that I can't put down.
There are three main things wrong with this book: 1.
Boring.
I think Ms. Wick should take a break from writing until she can weave a yarn as great as her earlier works.
Boring.
I had a very difficult time even wanting to pick this one up.
Well, the bulk of the book is set in California with one of the "lead" characters (the Navy man) absent from every chapter for about half the story.
The plot actually had tremendous potential.

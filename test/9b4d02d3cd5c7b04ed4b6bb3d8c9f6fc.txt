I would have to unplug the unit to reset.
Returned the radio to J&R.
; Had to buy another unit to get the original shipping box to return first radio.
After 3 days or so Radio kept freezing, locked up.
Still waiting for my credit.
I can live with this as long as it doesn't get worse.
When the radio froze the remote or the knobs on the radio had no function.
Then the LCD screen went blank.
I think I am too embarrassed to return this one.Buyer beware.
It's just a radio!
Got the radio sounds good!
Is it overheating?
Radio will freeze after playing for 6 hours.
Unit gets pretty warm.
Second radio came.

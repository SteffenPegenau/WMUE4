On the brightside, this Billboard Dance Chart club hit runs over 7 minutes.
Free (5:10)4.
Chapter two/the joint is jumpin (3:54)11.
For the most part, it's like a DJ invited you into his room and began playing you repetitive filler beats and rhythms.
Then, to put a club anthem like Joint Is Jumpin on here in a 4 minute dub medley with another track just goes to show how badly they missed the mark here.
Oh yeah (5:54)5. a better world (4:41)6.
Destiny drum (3:59)3.
One of the new mixes of Ultra Nate adds some vocal flavor, and finally, much later on, He Gives More lures you into thinking the party has finally begun.
Allow the drums (5:39)7.
Ride the beat (4:55)8.
Fast groove (1:28)12. sun rising up (5:39)13. u ain't that good (6:34)
Track times:1. feelings (5:39)2.
So boring.
He gives more (7:36)9. drum roll (4:41)10.
And finally, the last 2 vocal tracks remind you what this mix COULD have been.

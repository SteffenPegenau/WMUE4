I guarentee you will regret it.
instead, get something like Roxy Hunter, or any American Girl movie.
All I'm just saying is Don't Get This Movie.
yes.
I was lucky that I got it at a discount, but nevertheless wasted my hard earned cash on this!
disgusting.
The Clique is not only stupid, but also down right bad.
I'd rather not get into the details.
If I had to choose, I'd rather watch something dunb like The Invisible.
I can't believe I chose this horrible movie over Underdog.
In my opinion, The Clique should be rated R.
girls who are under 18 should not be watching this.
Oh did I mention that some of the movie was disgusting?
For parents who have any daughters under the age of 13 or 14, DON'T GET THIS MOVIE!!
Parents who are very cautious about what DVD they get for their kids (boy or girl) would agree with me that The Clique should be on the "DO NOT GET" list.
I got this movie and I'm living to regret it.

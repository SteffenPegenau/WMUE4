It's not worth the grief.
It is a shame that the publisher released this game in UNFINISHED coondition.
The audio quality is horible.
The mouse pointer disappears during game play.
The game freezes constantly when you can get the mouse pointer to stay alive.
I had to reinstall DirectX and reconfigure my video drivers on BOTH computers.
First of all, every time you put the game in the CD drive, it wants to reinstall itself.
I have NEVER, in 13 years of playing PC games run into one that has so many problms.
Ya know what, don't bother.
It has been in the stores since January 14th.
It was installed on both a WIN95 and WIN98 computer, both with Gforce 2 video cards and 128MB ram.
It speeds up.
If this is the way they release games, these folks should be forbidden from selling, period.
On the Data Becker web site, they claim a patch is comming soon.
Oh, and when I uninstalled it, it uninstalled DirectX.
It slows down.

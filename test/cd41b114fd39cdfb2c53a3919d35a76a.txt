As soon as their is looser fabric, it loses power.
Even when it worked, it didn't work great.
It worked better on furniture that was a more rigid construction.
I had it for many, many years.
It finally broke and now I can't find anything to replace it.
There was hardly any pet hair in it, but I cleaned it out and had the same problem.
It was awesome!
Makes a lot of noise but doesn't do a whole lot.
Both did the exact same thing.
This is the 2nd Rug Rat I purchased.
It also had a vent slide on the side to control air flow.
I have yet to find one of these things that work well.
The brush barely moves as if it's stuck.
It does not work well when used on bedding, as there is no way for air to flow, so it locks up the brush.
After using it for a very short time (once or twice for a few minutes each time), it stops working properly.
Years ago I had one that looked very much like the Rug Rat but it was made by Kirby.

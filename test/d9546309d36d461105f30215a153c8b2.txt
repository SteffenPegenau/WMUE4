I thought Pokemon Snap was MUCH better!
That was fun.
This game just has no point.
That game was one of my favorites.
you do the same thing over and over.
It's too easy too.
Boring!
I mean the gameboy pokemon was better than this one!
You attack and beat and attack and beat.
Fighting is the only thing you do.
If you want a good pokemon game get any of them for gameboy including Yellow, Blue, Red, Gold, Silver.
This is fighting ONLY.
Or even better, get pokemon snap!
This game is boring because it's all the same.
You get to go on an adventure and find things and get items!
If you get a different pokemon, it doesnt matter.

It is made for water fill only with the hose.
So, the statement to fill it with water OR sand is misleading.
But what a stupid design.
Don't even listen about sand fill being a realistic fill options, unless you are ready to do the "acrobatics" that my hubby and I did, which was a giant drag.
Agree with other reviews -- good size, moves somewhat as the base is not heavy.
Sand made the base quite sturdy, more so than water would.
Guess what?
It was VERY difficult.
It was a huge pain.
The instructions say: can fill the base with water or sand.
The opening is as big as the opening in a gallon of milk.
One person has to poor and the other has to hold "funnel" as the openings were the exact same size and did't fit together.
To make it heavier, we've decided to try sand.
We still put sand in by cutting the the empty gallon of milk pack and using it as a funnel to poor sand it.
We did it finally.

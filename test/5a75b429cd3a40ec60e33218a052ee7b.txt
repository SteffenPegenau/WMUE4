Except the trigger doesn't work.
No real crack - the plastic just sort of "mushed" apart.
Or order up a metal trigger and guard from one of the aftermarket suppliers when you order this gun.
Both he and I loved it, except for how finicky it was cycling different types of ammo.
And the gun will not shoot without the new guard.
Then comes time to clean this thing.
Turns out this one likes Remington Gold.
Yours may not.
Put it back together, tighten down the trigger guard and we're done.
A quick look at the trigger guard and it's broken.
Took this little beauty (stainless version) out to shoot a few times with my grandson.
Go buy a Ruger.
Called Marlin for a replacement and have been waiting over a month for my part.
No real issues there.
Very poor choice of plastic on this model.
Nice looking gun infected with a terrible trigger/guard design and horrible customer service.
And I took particular care when I tightened it because it's plastic.

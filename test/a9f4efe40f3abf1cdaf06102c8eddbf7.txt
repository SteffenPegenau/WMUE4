I was SO excited about it.
So, now DS just uses it as a bike.
We put it together etc.
2.
We are a Military family and in the last move the pin that holds the handle on was broken.
Begged my husband and finally we got it.
Well, our DS Loves it.
DH or I have to help him and he doesnt like that.
He is 3 now and he is forever on that thing.
The rocking - my son at 3 still cant rock that thing.
He still pushes with his feet though...
The only down falls were: 1.
We got this for our son 2 Christmases ago.
He wants to be able to do it and it bores him quickly.
I am 5'3 and DH is 6'4.
The adult push handle is SO so very low.
He has to stoop to push it and it even hurts my back.. ugh.. 3.

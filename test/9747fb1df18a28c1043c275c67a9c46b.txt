I can't tell you how much she disgusts me.
Just like the person herself.
I can't use the words I would like to use to tell you what I really think about this bleached blond joke.
Kim
She has no business being a talk show host, or a radio host, her credentials are a joke.
I would never recommend reading anything this person writes at all.
Just like her.
She makes me ashamed to say we have ONE thing in common.
We are both chromonsonally female.
I was going to try to keep an open mind about her and see if she has a clue of what she talks about.
I flipped thru this book just out of curiousity, because #1, I think this ridiculous woman is a farce and a affront to all women.
The book is trite, and way to predictable.
She also doesn't know how to keep an objective view about anything, her style is blatantly explotative.
The book reflects her one tract closed closet she claims is a mind.
She doesn't.

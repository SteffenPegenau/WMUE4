We're keeping our fingers crossed.
The picture was very red and needed constant adjustment.
Of course it looked great on tv and the price was right on target.com.
We're very disappointed in Syntax's quality control.
We saw it on shop at home.
After some delay it arrived.
We now have our third tv and it too is damaged!!!
We are now waiting for #4!!!
We pulled the box off the new tv to discover a very large dent on the top of the back panel.
Something is wrong with the stand causing it to tilt forward.
We contacted Syntax who sent a new main board and a tech to install it.
My husband and I bought the 32".
So back went the first two tv's.
So we were sent a replacement set.
That part was defective.

Okay, but not my favorite.
Well, it is like a stage play; or, I guess it -was- a stage play.
Sometimes it fits to have a girl in one of the songs, but sometimes it seems like, "Let's try this."
I kept expecting someone to go off to war.Damian does a very good job with his part, and Ryan Kelly is good,of course.
I say let them sing.The fact is, I like them so much, I would probably get anything with them in it, -to a point.
Of course, in this one, girls were necessary, but...This is a sorry review, because I find myself struggling for words.Mickey Thorne
Hmmm.
(Memories of High School plays.)
I give them credit for being good sports.
Not really excited about the girls twisting and flitting about either.
Ha!
These guys are singers, and darned good ones!
The rest are okay too, except a bit awkward at times.
If you must do it, maybe a bit more experience will help.In any event, I will watch it again; glad I have it; otherwise I would wonder why I did not.
Whose idea was this anyhow?

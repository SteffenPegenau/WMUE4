They are ok and the book is great.
It is a great reference and the writer is funny and very knowledgeable.
If you are ever stuck in the woods with a book...
(Baileys irish cream and Kahlua) Many More.
It is loaded with much more information.
The only downside is that some of the diagrams and photos are dated.
This is a great start.
If you are looking to make any alchoholic drink from scratch.
Highly recomended.
They are black and white.
I bought this book because it was recomended everywhere I looked.
It is a guide for people trying to manufacture beer, wine, spirits and liquours.
This is it.
Also has a ton of recipes to make your favorite liquors from scratch.
I was looking for information on distilling ethanol.

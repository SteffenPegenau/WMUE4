I expected more from this film.
The cornfield chase was nice looking.
Not to ruin anything for ya.
And I dunno when he had time to do what he did at the end.
It's simpler but much more mysterious and thrilling.
It looked like a class B thriller.
I just couldn't get into it, and it just didn't work on a few levels.
To leave the theatre.Wow.
It wasn't scary, and there was no pay off in the end.
The end was nothing special.
Which means plenty of thrills and even some cheese thrown in for fun.
It's premise is unoriginal but brilliant in these days of typical teenage slasher flicks.
But somehow it just didn't work.
If you wanna see a better thriller road movie, rent Kurt Russell's Breakdown.
It had some nice scenes, like the big bad truck going THROUGH this other truck in the beginning.
The truck driver was just some big fat dude, nothing special or scary.

Personally, I think this should be the last Janis CD you should own!
Misery'n--Would be great, but 80s instruments are added.
Magic of Love--This song has never been a favorite and is not a very good version here.
Farewell Song--This can be found on Live At Winterland '68 digitally remastered.
Tell Mama--You can get it on 18 Essential Songs or Janis 3-CD digitally remastered 2.
Catch Me Daddy--80s instrumentals ruin this song that is only available here!So, decide for yourself.
But worth having.
Amazing Grace/Hi-Heel Sneakers--Would have been great if the whole songs were used, instead they are edited down to less than 3 minutes!

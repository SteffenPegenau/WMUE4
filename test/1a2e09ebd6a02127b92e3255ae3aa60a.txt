This is a typical revenge story.
In real life one hopefully would give up.
In Finland it is not allowed below 15 years, which is as it should be.
One of them was Eastwood himself.
Eastwood is feeling pangs of mercy, but the film requires revenge.
It took a great part of the film.
There were some loose ends in the story.
Eventhough he was almost hanged.
Ben Johnson is always great, but his part was very small.
That's a main motive in westerns.
Was it really necessary to have the long hanging celebration?
The other actors were good, too.
There were a couple of things that were good in this film.
Perhaps this was meant to be so.
Is this film really PG13 in USA?
Inger Stevens is looking men who rape her, but does not find them.
Is it enough to get a man to risk his life until the rest of his life in order to finalize his evenge?
Of course, films are getting more and more violent, but more than this I do not care.

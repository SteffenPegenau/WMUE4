I enjoyed meeting new characters and envisioning Holy Trinity, but not for a final book.
The Mitford characters were practically forgotten.
Without going in to detail I will just say a lot of characters I had grown to care about were simply never heard from again, or were simply offered a cameo in this novel.

Agreeing with others, .
Everything seemed too rushed.
Perhaps this should have been a new series.
Sorry, but except for a few moments, this one never grabbed at my emotions as most of the other books did.
If this was going to be the final Mitford series story there should not have been so many new characters introduced.

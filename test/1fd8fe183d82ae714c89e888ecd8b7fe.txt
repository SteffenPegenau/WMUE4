A brighter LED will help finding this out WHILE I am driving.
Some notes on the item: (i) It runs a little bit hot, but not to a point where you cannot hold it.
Not a big deal since my car can supply 120W only.
Am I picky on this?
(v) No, there is no air plug, at least "not any more".
(iv) The inverter is really small at around the size of a 2.5" hard disk, but of course thicker.
Hope these information helps any one who is looking for an inverter.
Should have a brighter LED in place.
It comes with a ciger plug and a clamp core (like those jump start cable) now.
It didn't say so in the specification.
(ii) The rating is 175W peak, 130W continuous.
It works flawlessly.
The fan never turn on with my laptop 90W adapter attached and charging my laptop.
(iii) The blue LED is nice but a little bit weak.
Just got it yesterday and used it today for my laptop.
On my car the ciger plug does not "lock" properly, so it may get loose and not working.

With codes readily available and easy to do.
I still enjoyed playing it.
Many times it ended in werid angles where I couldn't see the person attacking me.
It is still a good fun game.
Some of the missions were very interesting, while others were not so.
Tenchu was without a doubt my favorite ps1 game.
Worse when it was a boss.
The graphics were poor at times.
I hope they do a Tenchu 3 for the PS2.
Overall it just isn't as good as it should have been.
I was really looking forward to Tenchu 2.
It gives it that bit extra if you just can't beat a certain boss.
But after playing it I just didn't think it was a worthy sequal.
But the POV was terrible.
I played it too death and loved to reply it again and again.

For one, EOTW seems to be one longgg series.
But I thought...what the heck, I'll give it a try.
Their short-lived joy.Heck, this should make a great movie, if done right.
I was a bit skeptical about reading this book at first especially after completed Eddings' The Belgariad series and Tolkien's LOTR series.
I'll be starting 'The Great Hunt' soon.
For a while, I was thinking about skipping this book.
However, I do wish Rand wouldn't blush or flush so much.
I could not feel for Rand or Mat.
Their torment.
Suddenly I found myself rooting for Rand, Mat and Perrin.
Well.
Makes him so 'ninny' at times.
But things started picking up after the 450th page.
I hope he'll have matured a bit by then.
for a start, it was excruciatingly detailed especially about their traveling.
I had to force myself to read through all the details about the landscape etc.

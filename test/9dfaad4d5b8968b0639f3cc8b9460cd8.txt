I saw the new Mead album and without even thinking, looking or sampling ran to the register, then to my car to load the CD.
As an avid David Mead fan.. and owner of his entire canon of works... as I marched around one of my usual music/retail stores desperately trying to find something worthy the other night...
I kept listening, waiting for the sounds that would seem as good or better than his last CD, Indiana.
!
And then the music stopped after 6 songs... and I was like, "WHAT!?"
But Indiana-or-better it ain't, and on top of it, it's short too!
Feh!!
I'm sure it has some redeeming value.
Disappointment was all I mostly felt... and kinda pissed.
Come on David, let's go forward and stop staring at the rear-view mirror.
Sorry.
I had no idea it was a "mini album."
Disappointed, that's my first reaction.
Guess I have to give it a thorough listen again.
Your music is way too vibrant to even consider retrospectives yet!!

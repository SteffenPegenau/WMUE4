2) They would just all of a sudden die, no lights, nothing.
Then the other on the motorcycle.
$100 bucks down the drain.The failed in one or two ways.
First one on the boat went bad.
We bought a total of 4 of these.
They worked great for one year.
Just a slight buzz inside the case that you'd normally hear.
However all 4 failed within 18 months.
Then one on the motorcycle.
1) They lights would flash back and forth but the batteries were perfectly fine and STILL using them years after with no problems.
TERRIBLE.
Worse part is they were purchased through Wal-mart who stopped carrying the brand not too longer after we purchased the chargers and we lost the receipt.
2 for the motorcycles, and 2 for the fishing boat.
Then the last one on the boat was removed.
But failed shortly after installed on another motorcycle.

to pop culture to inside jokes, we made fun of this movie and had a wonderful time.
This movie was so bad it almost made me ask for my money back.
D-Wars should do the trick.
But, it was fun.My friend and I were alone in the theater so we made fun of it at every turn.
I can't explain why I love it, though.
It was just plain, out and out, bad.
There were rocket launcher toting slugs and acting so painful I needed an aspirin.
It just seemed to fit.
It wasn't Godzilla bad, not even Gamera bad.
and 'I'm in your city, eating your reincarnated virgins!')
But the first time was such fun, we didn't even ask for our money back.
(At one point we broke out into Fett's Vett by M.C.
)Watching the movie a second time just wasn't as funny.

We're waiting to pick up a copy so we can inflict this pain upon a new audience, an audience which needs punished but not killed.

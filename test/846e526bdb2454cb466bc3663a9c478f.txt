The beat is pretty tight that was done by Organized Noize.
"RPDG" is a Freddy Calhoun solo.
"Some People" gets on my nerves.
The production is handled by Organized Noize and themselves.
Songs like track #7, "9 Months", & "Some People" are just straight garbage.
Freddy Calhoun, Lucky & Pauly Calhouns.
ATL's independent Trio, The Calhouns drop their debut album.
Other than those and a few medicore tracks, the album is worth gettin'.
Everyone should definately check them out.
They deserve to be heard.
"Slapped" is like one of those Southern crazy anthems.
The First 6 Tracks on the album are dope.
They are also backed by affiliates Major Hog, Slimm, & Uncle.
Lucky and Pauly do a good job over "Street Life" which is my favorite track on the album.
Consisting of Dungeon Family member Cool Breeze a.k.a.
"9 Months" is nothin' but a run down Drop It Like It's Hot.
Freddy holds it down on his own track talkin' about handling the rap game.

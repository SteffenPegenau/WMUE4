She brings her emotions into the songs and she's amazing.
If u like her album, seeing her live is no comparison.
If you like them, you'll love her.
I saw her live the other night and she's awesome.
This is her second album and she is ready to start working on her 3rd.
She's been compared to Ani DiFranco, Alanis Morrisette and Jill Scott.
I picked up her cd and liked it.
She has a range of sounds, ballads to rock.
I liked it so much, I went back the next night to see her again I was that impressed by her.
"Song You Wanted" starts off slow and melodic and about 1/2 way through it picks up.
She is a very talented young lady.
I recommend that you geth both.
Her songs are real and honest to herself.
"Liar" is also an up-tempo rock song.
But she is one of those rare artists who blows you away when she's live.

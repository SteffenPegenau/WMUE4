Love the song, Raven's adorable, catchy tune.
!I Decide-Good song, good voice, catchy tune.
!Breakaway-Other best song on here.
What more do you want?Because You Live-Fun song.
This is an absolute triumph for Julie Andrews.
Again, end of story.I can't believe I was able to hear Julie Andrews sing again!!!
Your Crowning Glory-Would buy the album just for this and 'Breakaway'.
I cannot stress that enough; it is bloody fantastic to hear from her again!!

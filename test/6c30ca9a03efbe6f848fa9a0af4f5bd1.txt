All of the special features should have been on one disc.
Here are my problems with the DVD.
Now people are going to argue this point with the "The alternate ending is on the second disc!!".
Minus the having to get up mid way to change the disc.
The movie itself is split into 2.
Then what is the 3rd disc for?
They were short and rather boring.
On the other side of the spectrum, the movie itself is fantastic!
I thought the creation of the DVD was to have the whole movie on one disc.
If the special edition wasn't so cheap I would have just gotten the regular DVD and probably would have been much better.
The VHS of Titanic was two tapes.
I finally got the DVD in the mail today and I was less than impressed.
The other featuretts really didn't astound me.
Titanic is my favorite movie and features my favorite actor and actress.
I reccomend the movie, but not this edition of the movie.
Not worth it.
It's the 21's century.

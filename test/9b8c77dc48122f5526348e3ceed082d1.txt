Taste, I believe is the word to apply.
Enjoy and buy the whole series on DVD when released.
Blood is thicker than water.
It grows and changes just like the characters and their relationships.
And honesty and integrity.
And delightfully.
The British have a way of telling their stories differently.
The characters only get better.
Plots and sub-plots.
Real people.
Love grows.
And love and involvements are presented in a natural manner that gives it a PG rating if such were to be applied.
People and their strengths and frailities.
I would consider it an honor to be a part of a series such as this.
A breath of fresh air.
I (and my wife) have seen the first four years twice.
The kind of project in its fifth year that could go on forever.
After our second trip around we watched Pride and Prejudice (BBC Version) and also the US Version from 1940.

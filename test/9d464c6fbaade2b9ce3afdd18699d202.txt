I wished for two things:1.
Story is easy to follow, good story indeed, compared to others of its kind.
2.
The CGI effects were spectacular, but it was confusing in one or two areas only!
I can read ... but, prefer not too!!
DVD with English Dubbling!!!
film vs. DVDs 128 min.
!If anything ...
!
A fantasic, brilliant story with limited fighting ... STORM RIDERS I believe lives up to it's hype!
With the GOOD & BAD reviews, I would have to agree with both agruments ... but STORM RIDERS is definately worth watching!!!
-- your missing out on many deleted scenes watching the VHS edition.IMPORTANT : The VHS has ENGLISH DUBBING - if you hate to read.
A little more fight scenes.
The DVD does not!!
It was fun, interesting, and most important ... it kept you glued to the screen.The VHS edition is a 90 min.

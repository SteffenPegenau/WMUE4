Moody and sensuous, the rhythms and feel of this disk are enchanting.
The accompaniments don't get in the way.
Her voice is easy to listen to.
sexy, soft and gentle, weave their way in and out of Jones' vocals.
Put it on when you're with someone you like a lot.
Norah Jones is a seductive interpreter of these songs.
But this is really all Norah's outing.
Have a glass of wine or something from a brandy snifter.
It has a way of growing on you after a few listenings.
I wouldn't call this jazz.
Funky, torchy, some just plain fun, take your pick.
There's not another pop recording on the market that can match it in that setting.
Guitar, piano, violin, accordian (!!)
The musicians are true accompanists.
The instrumentation is sparse, in a good way.
It has more of a pop feel to it, but damn it's good.

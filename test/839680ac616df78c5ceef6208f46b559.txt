The best songs on this cd is top quality pop music, some of the best in my big collection.
Btw, the girls can really sing, that`s for sure!!!
: 5/511.No Secrets: 2/5I strongly recommend this cd to everyone who like happy "girl group pop" from 10-15 years back, just forget the weak tracks and buy this cd for what it is at it`s best!!
I just wish the rest of the cd was just as good, but unfortunately it has it`s weaknesses, so i`m sorry i can`t give it a top score.
Skin deep: 5/54.
It`s alright: 5/56 I`ll remember you: 4/57.
Hot: 3/59.
That`s what girls do: 5/52.On the floor: 4/53.
What are you waiting for?
I`m really happy for this recommendation from amazon.
I know what i want: 2/510.
Ok, so i took the chance and bought this cd of a girl group i`ve never heard of before, and i don`t regret it for one second.
Kids In America: 5/5(my favourite yet)5.
So, let me rate the songs:1.
Here i am: 4/58.

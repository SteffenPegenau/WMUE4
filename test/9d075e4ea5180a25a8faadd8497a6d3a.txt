graphices are asome.
cool game but short.
it's like a sequel.
Story cool.
The game isen't made after the game.
(Dane it) The movie clips are DVD clear.
If the only they made the missiens a littel bet longer it would be a 3 disc game.
in the game it goes with neopole and goust.
same story but on diffret side of it.
I'm just renting this game.
This thing is 2 disks long for crying out loud!
Then why did I rated 4 instead of 5 you ask?
the controls are very easy and fun to use.
I know the reason it's slow.
the sound riases the roof.
2 day i'd had it amd beated it.
it shows stuff that goes alone the movie.In the movie it's goes with neo and morfeues.

Let's not worry about HOW anything is happening here, lets just focus more on having a big flaming head look at the camera kinda sidewaysey a bunch and run to the bank...
The acting was real crappy and the special effects were pretty good.
The plot was real dumb.
If you saw the first one and liked it, give this a shot.
It looked cool.
"All my friends are being heinously murdered?
Doop dee doop dee doo AHHHHHHHRRRGGHHHHH!!!!"
Yeah, that kind of complete idiocy was rampant in this film.
It was like those old horror movies where everyone in the movie is so stupid like they've never had to use common sense a day in their lives.
It was real dumb.
If you thought it was stupid, this one will not surprise you in any way.
Actually, I didn't try this, but I bet if you watched it on mute it would actually be cooler than with sound.
But it wasn't cool.
Let's go see what's down in the cellar!
The story had so many holes in it you could barely see the cheese.

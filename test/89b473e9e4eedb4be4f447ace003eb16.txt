But this album is far from his best.
But even sister Janet makes better songs.
How many times are we gonna have to hear "Heal The World"?
It is a new Jackson classic.
Michael are overproduced.
Michael is still the king, only threat can be in the futher: Robbie Williams.
Even this, it is still a better album then Sony Records seems to think.
He have tried to much.
Becourse that song, it in best Jackson/Santana style.
All the uptempo songs alright, but the ballads are to many.
I hoped it would be the best pop album in the year.
"You Rock My World" was that song, we have been waiting for since "Blood On The Dancefloor".
They should give it a chance.
The king of pop made a great return.
If they release "Whatver Happends", they will see, Michael on Top 10 of the Billboard chart again.

She isn't normally this disappointing.
This book is missing A LOT of things.
The plot was INCREDIBLY weak.
The main characters are able to fall in love with each other after only meeting 2 MAYBE 3 times.
I don't recommend it at all unless you are Really desparate for something to read.
And in the end when it is proved that Freddie was right all along there's not even a big apology scene.
It had potential but didn't come close to making it.
But Freddie (heroine) keeps coming back for more.
The story was incredibly hard to believe.
Ok I'm going to try to make this review as short and sweet as I can.
And each other those times was about 15 minutes max.
So overall this really isn't that great of a book.
But do read some of this authors other books.
And the secondary character Lavinia pushes it way to far mistreating our "heroine" of the story.
This wasn't my first of her and won't be my last either.
I don't know about you but friendship can only be pushed so far.

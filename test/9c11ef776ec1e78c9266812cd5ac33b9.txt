I give it 4 because I still like it despite the assembly line fabrication.
The samples are put together nicely to gel with Stefani's vocals.
Yes, "musicians" like Gwen Stefani are a dime a dozen.Is she eye candy?
Yes.Do we talk about her more because of Gavin Rossdale?
It makes sense as a solo album.
They're party tracks.
In my view, no.
The formula only really works with the support of MTV.I give the record 4 stars.
But is that the point of this record?
"Serious" and "What are you Waiting for" garner the most airplay.
Yes.Stefani is many things.
A lot of credit goes to the production staff.
She figures she's learned the lessons of the shallow end and it is time for her to test her limits.The tracks are good.
I can't count the DJ compliments the tracks carry.
This record is Gwen's tip toe into the deep end of the pool.
One thing she is not is original.
Yes.Can she sing?
Everything about it screams for TRL attention.
However, this record is clearly an MTV record.

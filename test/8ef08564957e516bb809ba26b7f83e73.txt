The author, Madeleine L' Engle, makes this book seem real.
This is an adventure you will want to read.
I really enjoyed reading this book because of its smart wit.
It's a little confusing, but the ending explains everything.
The ladies want to help the children find their father.
They are living in agony.One day Meg Murry, Charles Wallace Murry, and their friend, Calvin, meet some strange ladies.
Which.
They must also fight the evil Black Thing and IT.
Their father disappeared one day.
The Murry family is smart but miserable.
Will they rescue their father?
To do so, they must travel through time and space.
Their names are Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs.
This journey is exciting and fascinating.
Will the children succeed in their mission?
I want to read the next book in the series, A Wind in the Door.
It feels like the whole book is coming to life, even the magical creatures.
I hope that book is as great as this one!

THE SURROGATE was a very interesting novel and kept me guessing throughout, which is the type of book I find very entertaining.
Stupid wording.
It seemed as though she through them in for shock value which did nothing to help the story.
The author successfully painted a picture of a couple very much in love but the sex scenes just made it sound tawdry and immature.
The profanity was way to graphic and completly useless.
What did that accomplish in moving the story forward?!
We will thank you for it later.
I am writing this review moments after finishing this book.
Especially the scene where the lawyer described sex with his wife.
Let it mean more and leave a lot more to the reader's imagination.
Let their love have meaning.
"His [...] was amazing".
Absolutely positively NOTHING!
The problems I had though are with the author's insistant use of profanity and sexual scenes.
Also, the sexual scenes between Jamie and Joe weren't needed either.

You'll also like if you like weird, but not sci-fi movies.
This movies' content should not be seen by children who are imature.
Profanity is in little which is most likely good.
It is rated R, I think.
THe movie has a ton to do with fighting.
I would rate rate it 2 thumbs-up.
It shows little blood and gore which is a sign of a clean movie.
It is awesoome with a ton of action and violence.
Overall I'd have to try not to rely on this review, but see it for yourself and decide.
It has no sexual activity in it.
I do not recomend this to be seen by children under 13.
It has some parts where it shows naked people.
This movie is good for all those who like anime and fighting combined into one.
The context of this movie awesome.
If you like anime this is a must-see.

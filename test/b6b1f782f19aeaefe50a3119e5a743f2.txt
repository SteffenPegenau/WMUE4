But, I crave the orchestral sounds of Wish and Disintegration.
And in love.
Lighten up.
And "Anniversary" is swell.
Let's all cry right now for all the "TRUE" cure fans who are enraged by negative reviews of this album.
And lost.
And sad.
"The End of the World" tends to be beautiful when driving at night.
Sure, this cd isn't awful, but how I wish it were better.
I miss the rich layers, the neverending build-ups, and the harmonies.
He's happy now, people.
And in pain.
My God, Robert did.
To me, this album comes across as outtakes of Wild Mood Swings and Bloodflowers.
But for some reason, I'm not connecting to this batch of songs.
I crave the feeling I got when I first heard "The Edge of the Deep Green Sea" or "Fascination Street".

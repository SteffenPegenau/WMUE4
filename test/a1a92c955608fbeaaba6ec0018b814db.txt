Just like RBF was good at ska.
It is a rock n' roll album with some ska beats every once in a while.
is horrible.
It isn't punk/ska.
Guess they don't play that anymore.
They just lost 13 bucks because I'm bringing this back.
I think you the guys should start asking hemselves what happened to their music.
Why in the heck did they let put out a record that is so bad.
Reel Big Fish I have one question.
Ask them how much money they think they are gonna make.
Reel Big Fish used to be my favorite band.
They are starting to sound like Chicago, but Chicago was good at what they did.
They are playing music they think will sell, not what they like.
Not a ska album with some rock beats like before.
It isn't ska.
Why did they do this?
Think about that.
I was so looking forward to this album but now that I've heard it I am very disappointed.
Why Do They Rock So Hard?

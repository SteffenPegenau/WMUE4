5, 6, 7 times?it is moving, human, and beautifully written.
.i've read this book maybe 4 times?
i was going through my reading block .
.
and maybe things are not as black and white as they seem.
i sighed when i got to the last page because i could relate and not only that .
it was over!this is a book of to be reckoned with,a book that shows all sides of life.what we see is not always what we get.
.
.
Anyways, i picked it up and mom basically ordered me to read it because she had heard really really good reviews and Oprah had just read it .
.
.
lo and behold, The Center of Everything is sitting on the coffee table.
.
.
.
.
i could NOT get into anything.

Pretty green color.
The product itself is solid.
I didn't want to return it for this.
I wish it had a bit more coppery colored stone in the back, but oh well.
It's the right height, this one.
I have zero problems with leaks or spluttering or anything like that.
I had no idea this thing was going to want to drink three to four cups of distilled water every two days.
Nice stone.
I plan on fixing this myself somehow one of these days.One minor problem that's subjective: It uses too much water.
This is because one of the stone inserts on the top ledge is glued on crooked.
As advertised.
It's varied but mostly green.One real problem with the one I got: The top ledge part with the light in it does not insert properly into the fountain lodging.
The shipping cost alone makes it not worth it.
One goes in.
If you don't keep it full, it gets noisy.Otherwise, is pretty good for the price.
So, the top sits fully crooked.
And so both stone inserts don't fit into the lodging.

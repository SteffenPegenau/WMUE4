It has a more rock-centered sound, which is a good thing, and although I was never a fan of these guys in the past, this record turned me around.

Can't Be Saved 5/5 (future single)5.
Every Day is a Struggle 4/511.
Calling All Cars 5/5 (single)6.
If you're used to the old Senses Fail, Still Searching may take some getting used to.
All The Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues (techno-ish intro/outro) 3/512.
Sick or Sane 4/54.
Bonecrusher 4/53.
The Priest and the Matador 3/5Still Searching slows down a bit in the middle and at the end, but the accessible nature of most of the material begs for a second spin.
Different doesn't always equal bad, although I still feel like SF haven't quite found their own identity yet.

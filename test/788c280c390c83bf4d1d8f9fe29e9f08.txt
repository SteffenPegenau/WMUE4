Why?
Epic story that carried through during the entire game.
Gameplay plus story.
Loved 'em.
I've played all the GTA's since 3.
Other characters (Roman and your old, now gay, friend) are simply annoying.
In San Andreas you had the corrupt cops antagonizing you from the first scene to the last, literally.
There is no consistent "bad guy" / nemesis, per se.
I felt disconnected from the plot and was simply "driving over there, shooting some guys, driving over here, shooting some guys, driving back over there, shooting still more guys, and so-forth."
The pinnacle was San Andreas.
GTA 4 lacks all of this.
Your Grove Street amigos, Woozy and others were woven into the story in meaningful ways throughout.
What's missing in GTA 4?
The story.
Awesome gameplay mechanics.
Characters (Like Brucie and Little Jacob) are developed and then dropped almost entirely.
Worth a play through, but leaves you wanting much, much more.

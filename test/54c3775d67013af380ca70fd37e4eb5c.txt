That is how it should be billed.
OVERRATED.
Alternately the author gives far too much depth or far too little.
Stop calling it either.
The story is boring, the characters are boring, and the setting is boring.
And it succeeds in being really depressing.
And as to what it actually is, it's still not that good.
If scifi or apocalypse stories are what you are looking for, move on.
The author knows how to put together a sentence and tie together bland storylines.
Sorry I need more than that.
I found this completely unexciting, non-thought-provoking, unemotional, tepid, and unimaginitive.
This book is NOT Science Fiction and it is NOT even primarily an apocalyptic novel.
It is most definitely well written, but it is primarily the story of a man looking back at his life and relationship with his best friend and quasi love interest.
I realize I'm in the minority but I have no idea why all of you like this so much.
Great it was written well.

Also listen to "Chop-chop Boom" for any reference to the rock music of that era (Elvis, Chuck Berry, Fats) and it misses big time.
Well there is nothing Doo-wop or rock N roll about this group.Earth Angel is a cover of the Penguins hit, and Sh-boom is a cover of the Chords hit.
You be the judge.
They sound similar to the Hi-Lo's.
Maybe swing (like the Four Aces???)
Their sound is wonderful but it is neither Doo-wop or rock N roll.
Nice tunes here, not too much filler, and enjoyable listen.
They came out under the banner of rock N roll in the fifties, but they were a little too sweet sounding to be considered rock artists.
Some covers are better than the originals.
"Crazy 'bout ya Baby" can be considered a novelty tune and not a real rock song.
But I am not saying either are bad.
Some good stuff here.Their sound is like the "Joe College" of pop music.
Now for the tunes on this CD.
but more like pure pop music.
The harmonies are crisp and tight.

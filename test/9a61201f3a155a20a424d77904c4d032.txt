In the past, I have owned several vacuums, from several name brand companies, and this is the best by far.
The Eureka 4700A has a washable filter, which I love.
It picks up dirt, dog hair, etc.
No more buying high-priced filters.
It has a light, which shines bright for night time vacuuming.
I would purchase this vacuum cleaner instead of a dirt devil.
Good purchase.
No taxes, shipping and it is shipped directly to the purchaser.
I have a dirt devil vacuum, which keeps losing suction.
It vacuums on carpet and floors.
It really deep cleans and makes the carpet look like new.
I love this vacuum.
The only thing about this vacuum I don't like is that it doesn't have enough on-board tools for other cleaning jobs around the house.
I will use some of my tools, which came with my dirt devil vacuum for other cleaning jobs.
It is currently in the repair shop.
One stop shopping, can't beat that.
The auto height adjuster is great.

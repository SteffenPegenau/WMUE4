About 2 hours into the movie I got so sick of this that I just stopped watching it.
See the original The Thin Red Line in black and white.
I fell asleep again.
Sure, it's an OK movie - if you haven't read the book.
It is so much better.A fine film full of potential - ruined.
A quarter of the way through I fell asleep and woke up.
Then, ANY war movie is 100000 times better than this.
I loaded this into my DVD expecting a fine film based on my all-time favourite book and I was disappointed... 10 minutes into the movie.
Saving Private Ryan is 100000 times better than this.
Thinking I had missed something good, I went back and watched what I missed.
It was sooooooooo boring.
Sigh...
Boring.
This was just garbage.
It's unrelated to it in almost every aspect.

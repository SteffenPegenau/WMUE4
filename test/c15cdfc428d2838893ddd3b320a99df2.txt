They'll tell you the formula and rant about it a little and that's it.
Often times it can get very complex and long.
Or when they talk about jumps in 4.1.
Hugely disappointed in this book.
The author must be thinking everybody is a math major.
They never really tell you what it is or how you recognize it/get it.
The formula they give is not the one you can always use.
Often times I try to to the practice problems and can't even find where they talked about it in the book... because they didn't.
None of that is mentioned, showed, or explained.
Like conditional probability.
All the other chapters are the same.
BUT, they only cover the basics.
It's vaguely explained and you need to consult other sources.
The things they do explain are explained ok.
Covering the basics is NOT enough.

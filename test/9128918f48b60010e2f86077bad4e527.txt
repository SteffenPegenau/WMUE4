I litterally mailed this album to Hell.
Fight and kill and die and fight, steel and kill and fight and might.
I microwaved it (if you've never done it, you must microwave at least one CD), broke it into pieces, then addressed the envelope to Hell, stamped it, and mailed the MoFo.
It was that bad.
I will deliver thee to ash.
Avoid later Manowar at all cost.
They've become cliches of themselves.
Everything Triumph and back is awesome.
Steel and death and kings and might, we are strong and bold and right.
You suck Manowar.
ROAR!
Burn in hell.
I hate you world.
Eat Shizite and die.This album deserves NO stars, but the world demands one.
Manowar, once Kings of Metal, have become Clowns of the Armageddon.

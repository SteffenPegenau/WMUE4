After 2 weeks, I receveid the product back ...After 4 months again ...
But I definitely feel like NEVER doing business with this company again.If you can NOT trust the reliability of a GPS ... you should not buy it!
I bought my Roadmate 700 in April 2005.
It is not turning on!
!So I decided to send to the Repair Center.
I hope it's not bad luck ...
After 4 months, it started to show power issues .
I'm very upset with Thales Navigation.
And that happened when I was travelling !!
It is showing the same power issues!
It happened twice with me !
it was not turning on.
but not turning on.
I'm sending the product back to the REPAIR Center, thanks god It is still covered by 1-year warranty.
Only blinking .

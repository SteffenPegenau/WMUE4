I don't own any of them so I bought this set.
He is always starting trouble with everyone & everything.
This is one great show.
It's no wonder that this show was once banned from TV.
But very funny.
It's really funny.
Some of it is just plain sick.
If you like Family Guy & it's dry humor, you will like this Christmas DVD.
I never knew how funny they were.
If you have kids, I wouldn't recommend this or any other seasons.
I never ever watched it before this year.
My father-in-law started buying the seasons one by one & every time we went down to visit we would watch some of them.
I got hooked on these shows.
This is a show for adults.
Cartman is one crazy kid.
From Santa carrying a gun to satanic animals.
If you own all of the 10 seasons out there, then you don't want this set because they are all in the 10 seasons.
If you can't handle bad language then you won't like this or any others.

Eraserhead is a jumbled mess of mixed visual metaphors and adolescent tripe.
Sure.
Poor Jack Nance.
It's somewhat expensive but the print looks great although the narrative is as murky as ever.
Is it good art?
It teeters on the fine line between dorky and cool.
He appears as lost in Lynch's film as Lynch clearly is himself.Is it art?
David Lynch is odd.
This just doesn't happen to be the right one.
Lynch is a very talented director when working with the right screenplay.
He was (briefly) my apartment manager during the making of Lynch's Dune.
Visually stunning but ultimately as vapid and empty as any amateur art project.For those folks that are interested (Lyncheads all I'd guess), Eraserhead is available at David's website.
I can't say I recommend Eraserhead.
Jack could be the sweetest guy in the world.
There are moments that recall the absurdity of Dali (when he was still an important painter).
Odd and he's very talented.

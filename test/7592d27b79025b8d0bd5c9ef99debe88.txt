His ear for dialog and dialect is staggering.
His ability to set a (mostly) dark and somber mood is (literally) scary.
His description of everything, I mean EVERYTHING, is unerring, uncannily so.
I was lukewarm about the Border Trilogy, but hooked after "The Road", "No Country..." and others.
But I don't know what the book was about.
His every word is poetry.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book (if "enjoyed" is the right word) but I have no idea what it's about.
I've read several McCarthy books.
I guess it was about a lot of things.
But I still don't know what it was about....
Wonderful, masterful book.
Like all the other McCarthy books I've read, it is compelling from word one.
No matter to me: I just enjoyed reading it.
I enjoyed the suspense, the symbolism, the gothic emotion, the rawness of it.
No one today shapes the English language like McCarthy.

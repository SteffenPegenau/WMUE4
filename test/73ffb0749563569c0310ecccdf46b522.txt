You layer on a thickish coat and it dries and you peel it off.
it's a tiny amount.
Works well on other face areas too - and not painful in less sensitive areas.
much better than trying to use strips.
(i think i can say that.)
i bought mine at Sally for 1/4 that cost.
The actual product is good.
you have to be fast or get help, that's all.
As many salons are now using this type of wax, I find it easy also.
The list price is NOT $20.
that has to be a lie.
One ounce is TINY - it's 1/12 of a can of coke.
just reminding everyone to check qty.The actual product works well.
I think it's pretty awesome.
It's painful on the upper lip - but honestly what isn't?

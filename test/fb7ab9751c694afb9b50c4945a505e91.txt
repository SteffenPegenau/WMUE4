I only got halfway through.
Hmm.
And this one.....I don't know.
Very disappointing.
Both the adult and YA ones.
I honestly thought it would and even could be tons better.
From the parts I read, it was okay though......
I've read every Buffy book up to this point.
I couldn't even finish.
I think Chris Golden and Nancy Holder have everything down more and it comes easier to them.
I mean I thought the ST's (student teachers) were there to cause evil to happen, but it seemed they were only connected to the monster by way of mere stalking.
It contained a very slow and developing plot.
Their books are the best.
Kind of typical.
:) But this one.

If you're curious about The Doors, this is the film to see.
He does it very well.
There's not that much new ground left!
No, it doesn't break any new ground.
If you're a Doors fan, you'll get this film.
If you don't like the Doors, you're not reading this review.
When You're Strange / A film about The Doors / A film by Tom Dicillo / Narrated by Johnny Depp: This is not a concert film.
Depp has done this kind of thing before, previously working on the film "The Source" about the Beat Generation poets, so he handles the job as expected.
It is like listening to an old Doors album, you know the material, but it's still a treat to experience it again.
It does its job of presenting the story and it does it VERY well.
As a documentary, I like it, so it gets four stars.
As a documentary, it is very good.
Johnny Depp does the narration.
This is not a `rarities' junk drawer.
This is a well made documentary about The Doors (Well, actually, it's about Jim being IN The Doors).

When I heard about the first SHARK ATTACK movie, I got giddy in all the right places.
Two: Sound problems.
Yep, that is about it.
Because it is so much better than this movie).
I bought it, loved it, and then bought the 3rd and second movies.
Who ever came up with that horrid idea should shoot them selfs in the head.
The second one has alot of problems.
Four: The acting.
Three: The story.
Everything else, the directing, the camera work, and the somewhat funny humor is ok. Best camera I have seen in a B-movie style film(Halloween doesn't count.
One: Sharks don't growl.
A pack of mutated great whites that hunt only people.
Ok, I amidit, I am a SHARK MOVIE LOVER.
Horrible, thats all there is to say about that.
Sometimes the sound is so off that you can't help but laugh.
No matter how bad they are, I have seen them anyway.
Watch if you must but don't buy it.

The writing deteriorated.
One of the enjoyments I have of reading fantasy is that you often get a view that is different from yours.
What I don't accept is zealots -- left or right.
Unfortunate when one's emotion trumps all.
Put him on one side of the teeter-totter and the worst Neocon on the other and they will balance it perfectly.He doesn't even bother to hide some names.
It is a biased portrait of the worst of Dubya's gang.
It carries it to the point that you want to see Stross water-boarded.The writing starts out well.
The premise is interesting.
Sad!
Lord know, there is little need for such exaggeration.
Then, like so many overreaching series, it falls apart.
That certainly happens here in an unattractive manner.
Very sad.
This author is extreme in that.
Zealotry results.

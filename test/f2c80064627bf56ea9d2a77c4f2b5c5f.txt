Many of the previous reviews have touched on Irving's allusions to Hawthorne's THE SCARLET LETTER which is certainly accurate.
God?
One more thing, my use of capital letters had nothing to do with Owen.
Divine Plan?
It's about FAITH.
Please dive in.
I think.
Really.
Christianity aside, Irving weaves a wonderful modern myth which is difficult to put down.
Regardless of your religion of choice or lack thereof, Irving builds on questions of faith and doubt throughout the novel which are essential for anyone struggling to understanding LIFE.
Motivation?
Fate?
But this book is NOT about Hester Prynn.
Chance?
I've just finished Owen Meany and have been mourning the end of the book at the office all day...This is a great and easy read.

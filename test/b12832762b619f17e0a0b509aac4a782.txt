Review within a review.
Also, Jackson's relationship with God is not as what Shaara depicts.
.and for that I am grateful.
.
.this reading led me, after-the-fact, to be disappointed in some of Shaara's depictions of Jackson.
.
.
Robertson's book is one of the best I have ever read and I recommend it to everyone who has an interest in history and biographies.
.
.
.
Still, an excellent book which piqued my interest in learning more about Jackson.
the fascination with lemons myth for one.
I read this book before reading Robertson's biography of "Stonewall" Jackson.

Why do I listen to "Peaceable Kingdom" twice?
No escape.
Rather loud, not only because the coffee-maker is rattling.
"Ceiling Unlimited" sounds almost the same.
Preparing breakfast, I put on "Secret Touch".
It has grabbed me.
It looks glorious.
It fits.
LN says the guitars sound like Placebo (maybe, but then, Placebo haven't been around half as long).
And again.I thought I'd hate this album.
Hey, there is a nice melody bit it "Ghost Rider".
Sounds like a lot of noise at first.
"One Little Victory" hammers away.
And then, on my way to work, looking across the city, a sliver of sun spilling out on the houses and green, I have "Earthshine" in my head.
Now it spins.
At my desk, I zip through "Vapor Trail" and grind "Freeze" into my ears.

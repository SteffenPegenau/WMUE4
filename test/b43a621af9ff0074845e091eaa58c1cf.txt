This failure made me a little angry because this iron is both expensive and such a nice iron.
Also 2 prior Rowenta's.
This is a real Gem!
It does everything well.
This iron responds to any user demand due to its high power elements.
Great product.
Owners of pre 1970 homes with older electrical circuits should be careful - this is a 1800 watt appliance.
I am quite handy and did the repair myself - the part cost about 35.00 - others have had problems getting the product repaired.I have owned many high end irond dating back to the expensive Panasonics of the 1970's.
Below was my initial review 14 months later I had to replace the temp control.
The are other fine quality irons that only use about 1200 watts.
By now they have to know of the failures on the temp controls.
Beautifully made.
I have owned 3 Rowenta Irons - as I look back now all the controls failed after a year of very light use.
It is even a vertical steamer.
This is perfect.
Highly recommended.

It is NOT compatible at this time.
Get a Pocket PC Phone Edition (next generation is due out) and then get the Bluetooth GPS unit with it.
Lots of problems with this model.
If you can't wait for the second generation due out soon, get the ATT pocket pc for $99 and get the wired GPS accessory for $200.
Recommendation for a PDA/GPS PDA?
Don't know where those expert reviews get their units.
Only have 32 MB - 28 leftover for storage.
You STILL get a better product.
You pay top dollars and still get a horrible PDA.
More importantly, with Pharos, you will get REAL TIME traffic information based on your current location (if you are in the 16th largest SMSA's).
You not only get a GPS enabled (wireless - bluetooth/802.11b) PDA but also the phone.
It will NOT download/sync correctly.
If you have Outlook 2000 or later, do NOT purchase this.
Wait until Garmin get their acts together.
Horrible return/support policy.
Skip it.

Them there flimin' people are gonna make a picture in our favorit bar!"
Where did they get them?
Oh wait, let me take a sip of Farmer Whitey's best moonshine so I can get a better view of this "unique" perspective.
There's absolutely no other way anyone could make such a dull, stupid movie.
Here, take an example.
What's the deal with the redneck square dances and drinking scenes?
The "guards" are drinking on the job!
Oh, and the werewolf is a blur with a yellow T-shirt.
"Look Jeb!
Or do all rednecks have silver bullets at home.
Any questions?
"The guards' guns are loaded with silver bullets."
I mean come on.
Really?
A total disgrace to "the Howling."
Mr. Fanatical Reverend?
Honestly, everyone has a thin personality and a drinking problem.
Hmmm... the director must have chugged a gallon of moonshine left around the bar.
There IS NO BEST SCENE BECAUSE THEY ALL BITE THE SAME AMOUNT.

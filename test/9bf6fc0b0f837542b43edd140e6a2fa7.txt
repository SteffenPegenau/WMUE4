The machine consistently crashed about every three months.
Brevity, will suffice.
Refurbished, not new!
Off-brand replacement cartridges will not work in this machine.
Works great, print fades after 900 pages - can't be fixed.
Not a good choice for home or small office.
The skin was marred/scratched in several places.
I chatted with the techies about this issue and they said the built-in, proprietary smart chip prevents their utilization.
Looking for an alternative printer.
Purchased a HP cartridge from Amazon.
After a year it completely shut down - formatting board.
Numerous other reviewers have accurately pinpointed the problems.
Yet, it does seem to "boom along" as required.
As I recall, it still cost me $50.
With the extended warranty HP, was able to send me a replacement.

Lets hope for our sake he never writesa book again.
Please, his littlestory about John Kennedy Jr. was such a joke.
Sorry, AJ but youare all talk.
His 15 min.
I read this book because I liked his show on E!Mysteries& Scandals.
of fame are over.
Hey, AJ, can I can get my money back!
I got tired of his"more on this later" you would forget what later was.And every other word was f***ing this or that.
He is awanna be mafia guy, only problem is he would be not makeit in that world.
All the picsin the book are of him looking "tough".
John hasmore class than to hang with Benza.
No wonderhe got kicked off Howard Stern, he is a jerk.
Get a real job.
Now the pages linemy cats litter box.
I really did not care how many women he sleptwith or the stars he hung out with.
I have never a read a book with so muchego in it.
I read the book to the endonly because I was laughing so hard.

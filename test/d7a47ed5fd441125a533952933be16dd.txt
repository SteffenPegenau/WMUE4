This was like a month or so before he was killed in a car crash.
Wait a minute...what's with all the melodic keyboard playing?
STILL a decent CD.
I mean, that CAN be a great thing, but in Savatage?
Have seen them several times.

Remember hanging out in a club's parking lot with guitarist Criss Oliva(R.I.P.
What luck,huh?
These guys STILL rock!Good tracks include the guitar ridden "Taunting Cobras", "Nothin' Going On", the instrumental "Visions" and "Stare Into The Sun".
The band's recently-new vocalist Zach Stevens seems to do the same.
Okay,so they're now changing.
)after a show trading off Three Stooges lines, calling one another a knucklehead, grape head, etc.
Always have felt that Savatage was truly an under appreciated metal band that never did get the recognition they deserved.

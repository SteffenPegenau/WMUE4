She is a great actress.
Amazing.
I love her.
Loved her in all.
But after seeing this movie I looked her work.
No not the overblown Barbara Streisand.
I had always heard of Bette David and others.
Has everyone known this but me?
She is a great American treasure that should be lauded as such more often and regularly.
.
But never Stanwyck.
This movie was great .
.
what a view of NYC in those days.
And saw others like John Doe and Double Indemnity and even Big Valley and The Thorn Birds.
But Barbara Stanwyck.

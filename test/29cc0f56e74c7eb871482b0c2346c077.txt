Edge vs Batista *** - I'm being a bit nice here.
Nice counter-wrestling as usual though.8.
Carlito did a great job in there.2.
Very hot opener and the crowd was into it.
Carlito vs Ric Flair *** 1/4 - Their best encounter yet.
It's stupid to have a 15 minute 2/3 Falls match.
Just mediocre.7.
'Nuff said.Overall worth a pass of course, had a nice set of match but just mediocre.
1.
HBK vs Randy Orton N/A - Nothing happen here.
The crowd were dead also.
They should've had Orton win though to get him more over.5.
CM Punk vs Elijah Burke *** 1/2 MOTN - These guys went out there and gave it all.
They showcased their talent and I believe had the most time.4.
MVP vs Benoit *** - Not least good match.
Lashley vs Team MaMahon N/A - Too short but as a segment, it's pretty entertaining.3.
Very good match.6.
The Hardy Boyz vs Cade & Murdoch *** 1/4 - C & M has gotten better.
John Cena vs The Great Khali ** 1/4 - Khali.

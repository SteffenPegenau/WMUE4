I was trying to find a new series after JR Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood; should have saved my money.
Save your money and time, read something else.
The author jumps perspective multiple times a scene making for a disorienting read.
He's tall, dark and brooding.
I would hate to see the rough draft.
The writing is amateur.
Unfortunately, the rest of the novel can't compete.
Not so much.
What characters aren't these days?
Personalities?
She's fair, delicate and naive.
And I'm still not entirely sure what the plot is.
But that is all there is to either one of them.
The prologue is great, I wanted to read more.
The characters are generic and unlikable.
Why is this book getting such high ratings?

I never saw myself as an artist.
Stay Safe!
Look for my stories in Free PUblications in my area.
I'm not sure how it happened, but I am the author of the first poem on Page 1.
"Our Town" and "Summer Weekly," to name a few.
But recently learned that there are many forms of art.
I have a passion for writing in particular.
It is our experiences in life that bring this book to reality.
There are many talented poets in this book, besides me.
The Colors of Life broaden many horizons defining Depression to Hope and Faith.
Although, I do write short stories, screen plays and lyrics.
I'm working on a few stories called "The Woods, Red Sky and The Storm."
I definitely recommend this book to any aspiring and long-time poets!
"Shallow Tears written by Jackie S. Kidd (ME)"I love this book.
I have blessed many people with this.
And I found a new passion for photography.
I hope you get a lot out of this review.
I want to buy another book since I only have 1.
Peace!

{:+} Yes; Morrie Louden is a gifted artist.
I guess I'll call it "potato chip music"; there's no way in the world to listen to this CD just once, at the first sitting.
All of it, and more.
You'll listen again... and again, to all of it---and come away so much richer for the incredible experience.
Many thanks.Kharyn Leigh
You won't use Time Piece for background music; you can bet on that.
You want poignancy?
This music won't remind you of any other music you've heard.
MONSTER/Musician?
You got it!
Morrie Louden---your music and your playing are gifts to the universe.
Each one takes you to a different part of your self---your core---that you didn't know existed.
Yes---speed--incredible ACCURATE speed... You want unbridled musical playfulness?
There are no "throw-away tunes" on this CD.
You'll sit down to listen... and feel... with your eyes closed---and you'll go on a most fantastic musical journey.
What to call Morrie Louden?

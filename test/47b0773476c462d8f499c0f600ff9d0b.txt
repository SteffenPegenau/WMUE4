I purchased this because I always wanted one as a child.
My parents never thought much of them.
Also, not only are you getting a good workout, you get a great looking lawn also!
In fact, I am an overweight, 44 year old woman and this is one of the best motivaters for exercise I have found.
The benefits: easy to use, very little storage room required, quiet, can mow in the rain or when grass is still wet, excellent workout.
Go green!
I've been using it for about a month now.
Go motorless!
You can see the fruits of your labor being cut from the lawn and you get fit also.I didn't realize people would purchase these to save gas, but that's another added benefit.
Not only is it easy to use and lightweight, but the yard is looking better and better with each cutting.
Go fit!
I recently decided to try it while my husband was out camping with boy scouts.
If you don't mow the grass, it gets too long to work.
WOW!
It's everything I imagined and more.

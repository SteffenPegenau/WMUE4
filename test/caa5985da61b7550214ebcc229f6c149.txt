If you have vista you can get it to work with some tweaking.
then click ok and run the driver installation.
simply download the right driver for your system x86 or x64 in XP format.
then here is the secret, right click the driver exe and go to properties.
Microsoft will say it is not compatible with this camera at all.
officially creative does not have a vista driver for this one.
then compatibility.
it will work in vista.
this is too old.
and voila, I am using mine in vista right now :)
the last driver for it was xp 64 bit.
click run in compatibility for windows xp.
be sure to unplug the camera first and then plug it in when asked.
it is hard to find it now.
ok be careful with vista.
creative does support vista on other products.

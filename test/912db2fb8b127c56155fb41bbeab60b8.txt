Love the show.
It is so CUTE!
Cute?
I suggest toy collectors and no higher than 2nd grade.
The thing only comes with Hamtaro!
It's extremely fun.
Not unless you buy 15 other sets to get enough hamsters to have any FUN.
For about 24 hrs!
I expected to get ALL the Ham-Hams with it!
Yes.
I recommend ages 4-7!
Fun?
was up!
The door broke off before 5 min.
Hate the house.
I got this toy for Christmas and let me tell you.
I mean, its little rubber hamsters in a doll house!

this is my favorite cd player...ever!
one problem with it are the headphones that came with it.
I also go mtn biking and running with it.
i recomend you get some good headphones to go along with this great cd player.
it has been out in the cold (40d) and still played.
i dont know why people dont like it.
and stepped on (by a horse, dont ask) it still works like it did the day i got it!
after about 2 months with them it started to play in only one ear.
I have had alot of cd players(all of them broke) but this one really stands up to what i do.
the skip protection is excellent.
I take it on all my trips with me.
they are junk.
it has been dropped (alot!)
This cd player is great!
i really love it.
it never skips.

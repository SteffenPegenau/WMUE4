Five months of pain had left me confused and deeply sad.In Oct.
It took a week after that and boom!
I treat them with Naproxen.
I'am in the process of fine- tuning my prevention medicine.
That was hard!
I didn't get better the first few weeks, until I eliminated the coffee.
I started Dr. B.
It hasn't been a cakewalk, but the program makes sense and has worked for me.
my headaches were gone.
After unsuccessful visits with two neurologistists and many different meds.I was losing hope.
I gave up all the foods and then some, that I thought might be triggers for me.
In the Spring of 2006, they became chronic, lasting almost 5 months.
I cried I felt so much better.
I still get a few migraines each month but they are less intense.
1,2,3 program.
I believe I would be even better by now but I'am having problems with the side effects.I'am very grateful for Dr. B. book.
I have suffered with migraines since my early twenties.

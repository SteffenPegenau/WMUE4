Everyone at the school thought she was perfect.
It was a short novel in verse about a teenager named Laura Li and her family.
This short novel was great.
I felt bad for Laura.
She had many issues and was a pretty messed up girl.
Laura Li volunteered at the school library.
Other than Laura's brother's illness, the plot was easy to follow.
However, that was far from the truth.
When she worked at the library, she listened to everyone's problems.
She started partying all hours of the night, drinking, smoking, and doing drugs.I was confused as to what illness Jimmy Li, her brother, had.
When she needed help, nobody listened to her.
It was definitely sad.
Her mother criticized and abused her.
I wish Split Image would have been a little longer so that the reader could have gotten to know the characters more in depth.
She had to endure everything that was going on at home.
He was very ill and needed Laura to do everything for him.
Split Image was an interesting story.

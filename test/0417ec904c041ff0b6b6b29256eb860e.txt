Either she doesn't know what the age group for GL is, or she's not aiming for 7-12 year old girls.
It's not appropriate for this age group although it says it is.
It wasn't good.
I had a subscription to this mag in the good ol 2003.
.
Last year's Dec/Jan issue had a How to Get a Boyfriend article and I was shocked.
The articles had a lot of good advice and was the age group it claimed to be back then.
Ok.
The writer was Jodi Bryson who writes most of the celebrity and fashion aricles.
I wouldn't buy this magazine for girls ages 7-12.
If you have a 7-12 daughter, DO NOT BUY THIS MAGAZINE.
I'm pretty sure that a 10 year old doesn't want to learn how to kiss a boy.
.
This zine is not what it used to be.
I turned thirteen this year and just read the Oct/Nov issue.

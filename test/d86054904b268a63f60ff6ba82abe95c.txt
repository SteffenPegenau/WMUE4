If you wish to be entertained, then I recommend this book.
Mr. Goodkind has to make his characters more endearing and remove some of the predictability for me to give higher marks.
Granted, it's not a literary classic.
This story isn't going to replace Lord of the Rings.
Goodkind succeeds on that level.
Basic plot line to 99% of fantasy epics.
You should expect it.
Good versus Evil.
I gave it a seven on entertainment value.
However, it does have the same basic plot.
He even throws romance and torture in there to boot.
It's an entertaining read.
It's how the author creates his world, characters and sequence of events that is going to make a book entertaining or not.
Good versus evil, Dragons, wizards, warriors, witches, beasts and the dead.
To complain that an author is unoriginal in this genre is like complaining that you got wet when you went swimming.
If you are looking for Shakespeare, you made a wrong turn in the book store.

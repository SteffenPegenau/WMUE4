The reason I did give it two stars rather than none, is it did have some jigsaw puzzles which I personally like to do.
etc.
Put it this way, If I lost it I wouldn't repurchase it, even at a clearance price.
You pick out a particular animal to puzzle together.
I don't recommend this game.
Most of the games were just not easy to figure out.
With these you can make them your screen saver when you finish it.
YOu can choose different puzzle piece shapes and choose how many piece.
Then you choose if you want to do it in 20 pieces or 500 pieces.
you have to download like 6 different times for the 6 different game titles.
That was kinda neat, but still not worth $10.
Even though you can purchase it for about $10.
Then in each game title you have to download another countless number of times for game has a few more games in them.
It still just wasn't worth it.
It was just to much I felt.

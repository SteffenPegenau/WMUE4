I picture monkeys running around for some reason.
3-About the same as 2 but when mellower beats 5-Similar to 1, probably the 4th best on here.
Track 1 - Decent song.
7-Song is a bit busy at times, sort of giving me a headache.
Probably the best dance song on here.
It has 4 or 5 good tracks which I suppose makes it worth it to buy it.
8-Probably my second fav on here.
2-Groovy beats and old-school vocals, not bad.
9-Great song, the best on here.
13-Good simple song with little vocals... ends the CD well.
Slow, deep, varying beats with a woman singer will also get me.
6-Soft beats with a sweet voice behind the lyrics.
Overall, I liked this CD.
I had been hearing this on the local indy radio station for awhile before I realized it was a Basement Jaxx song.
11-It has its moments.
12-Didn't I hear this in a TV commercial?

This version works perfectly!
!
It doesn't!
It won't!!
The game's freeze every few minutes!
My computor meets all specs for this game.
And I'm running "Windows XP".
Unfortunately, there's a down side.
What a shame!!
Don't buy this version!
First, these games are totally awesome!
Digital leisure provides a download that's is supposed to fix the problem!
I tried contacting Digital Leisure and got no response.
I bought this hoping it would run on my computor.
Buy "Dragon's Lair 20th Anniversary Edition DVD".
They are for the most part arcade perfect!

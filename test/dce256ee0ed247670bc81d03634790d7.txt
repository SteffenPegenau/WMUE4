The manga is also available through amazon.com.
^.^ But seriously, this movie is really good.
You think it's a show just for little kids.
I'm a big time moonie, and I'm 17 people.
I didn't like it too much when I first saw it, but I swear, it grows on you A LOT!
I admit it.
I know, I know.
It is the climactic finale to the first series, and it is well worth the money.
It is very well written, and I recommend it to an audiance of seven and up.
Now I love it.
Domo Arigato!!
It's good for an age group of (I think) nine and up.
-.^ (Thank you very much!!)
And if you don't know of any little kids, send it to me!!
If you love Sailor Moon or are just starting, you will love this movie.
I also advise you get the original "manga" (japanese comic) series too.
And if you do buy it, and find you don't like it, give it to some little kid you know (I can guarantee they will love it).

Thank God I recorded and then burned Chill Out on DVD!
Why?And, again, why?Why this constant disrespectful treatment of 1) the makers of these films, who create in widescreen, creating beautiful and dramatic shots, and 2) the viewers?

Why the **** is this presented in 4x3 in the US???
!This is an affront!Oh, by the way, did I mention that I hate the 4x3 format, when not original?Thought so.5 stars for the film, two down for the 4x3 presentation
Why?

When this film (great one, by the way) was shown in Sweden last year, it was shown in the widescreen 16x9 format.

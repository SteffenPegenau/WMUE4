And good actors to act it.
The chemistry between her and Anakin (Hayden Christensen) is... not there.
"I truly... deeply... love you."
I liked those.
But the way she says her lines is just... awful.
It's so stiff!
I was hoping Episode II would be better but it was -remarkably- worse.
Most of the time she's speaking in a monotone.
The original Star Wars movies were great.
They're either glaring at each other or sharing spit.
But the acting...
Ah, well... maybe Episode III will be better.
Take Natalie Portman.
Beautiful girl, would be great as a model.
But Episode I wasn't that great.
Of course, the special effects were very nice, but even with the most impressive bells and whistles, you have to have a good story to back it up.
They should have gotten Keira Knightley.

It was just as bad, came out green.
I found this and all I could find were good reviews.
Sounds great, right?
it was the most vile, disgusting concoction I have ever smelled or tasted!
I was so disappointed.
I'd been looking for a neutral mix that I could mix with juice and fruit.
My first try I mixed it with milk, vanilla yogurt, some vanilla sugar free pudding mix and frozen strawberries.
Put it thru the blender and OMG!
We'll see.
Later I tried it again, this time with OJ and strawberries.
I could only choke down a few swallows.
I opened the canister and it had a pleasant mild vanilla scent.
Maybe I can get used to it.
The ingredient list and nutrient lists looked great.
And I don't have a picky palate.
Maybe it's PMS messing with my taste buds, but, nothing else tastes bad.
I haven't decided yet if I'm going to send it back.

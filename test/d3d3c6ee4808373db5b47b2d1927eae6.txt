I like the first track (Opening), track # 5 (Forgotten), and I kind of liked "My December" for a while.
(um, kind of, hehe)
Forgotten to Frgt/10) and the CD cover art and stuff.
I REALLY REALLY REALLY liked Linkin Park's debut, Hybrid Theory.
So, get Hybrid Theory before you get this!!!
I see this CD as a ploy to get more money out of us.
And boy, did they sure fool me!
I recommend HYBRID THEORY over this.
I mean, the songs get kind of annoying after a while.
My favorite parts of the CD are they way they mixed up the words and formed weird words (ex.
The original HYBRID THEORY was 100x better than this.
It's not worth the money.
Enjoy!
But the rest of the CD is pretty skip-able.
But this CD was pretty bad.
So, I'm pretty much saying to not buy this album.
But the CD itself wasn't that great.
This was as big of a dissapointment as Evanescence's "Fallen" was to me.

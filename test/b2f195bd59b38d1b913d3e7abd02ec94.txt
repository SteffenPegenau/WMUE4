tim hardin coulda been great.
its a shame.
live at town hall ("tim hardin live in concert") was his best album.
almost 40 years later i can still remember his heartbreaking song "lenny's tune" (from that album) for his friend and fellow junkie lenny bruce.
the 1960s and drug use were an unmitigated disaster for working class young people.
drug use and the 1960s did him in.
i hate it when people romanticize the 1960s drug culture.
he never lived up to his potenial.
along with bob dylan and joni mitchell, tim hardin was one of the very best 1960s singer songwriters.
these few great songs are all we have left.
there is only one song from that album on this cd.
that song and others should be on this cd.
he shoulda been great.
they must not have seen the wrecked lives i saw.
unfortunately he was a junkie.

Please make sure your PCI Slots work with the card you are ordering.
I'm sure it works well, with older computers.
:)PS: I just took the card out of my Lenovo, It has, built in, "Geforce 6100" graphics, SO DUH!
Why?
Look at your graphics device, in your device manager .
I will, buy another card from this company, if they have the right one,to meet my needs.
It may be wise, to use this information, to order a card.
My Lenovo 3000 J series 115 AMD X2 ,Ditto, On board graphics better.
YIKES!
It's, what it is, and it's not "it" for me .
Its not as good as the on board graphics,or out of date.
I am not knocking this product!
So be careful.
BUT, my Dell Inspiron, 530 with Intel core 2 Duo hates it, would not boot up at all.
Now it will work on the Lenovo, BUT, there is a big downgrade in performance.

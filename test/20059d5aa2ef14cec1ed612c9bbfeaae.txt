I also had to send my original set back.
I don't like that there are some fun things missing.
I have missed watching it.
I am a bit disappointed with the problems on the DVDs but glad I have it.
I could not watch it on the television or computer.
I am glad that the video came out.
Will there be a video set II?
Next time I guess I will go to the store.
There are episodes that were favorites for me that are missing.
The second set, sent quickly, had stains on it too.
It plays better but it too has problems.
It had chips and stains on the DVDs.
This is my first Amazon purchase.
I did not wish to send it back again.
I wish I had known that not all the episodes are included.

Authors mocked his height.
Knightley made Lizzie look stupid with her out of place grins and smirks.
Although I loved the cinematography, music, and costumes, I didn't enjoy the movie at all.
I don't think so.
Everything is great in this movie EXCEPT for the actors or their portrayal of Austin's characters by the makers.
Irritated most of the time.
Sorry.
As for MacFadyen - watch "Little Dorrit" BBC series, he is absolutely adorable there.
Mr. Collins is not funny.
What a disappointment!
Than I saw MacFadyen in Little Dorrit (Charles Dickens story) and I was left absolutely astonished by his work.
I heard the reviews that this version was not even close to BBC series.
Wanting more of his acting I purchased this one.
They also made Bingley look absolutely dumb.
Darcy is not for him for sure.
Don't understand some exalted reviews posted here.
I believed and didn't even bother to watch.
Macfadyen's Darcy is too soft.
Is it all that you can laugh at in this character?!!

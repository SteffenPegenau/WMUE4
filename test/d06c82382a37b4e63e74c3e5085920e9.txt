They're always unique, but often it isn't enough.
0+2, Mr.
Maybe they'll bounce back on the next record.
As for No One...
Small Parts Isolated And Destroyed offered its title track, "And That's Sad", and "Real Love".
And then they lost it.
Happy, Worldliness, Dance Of the Headless... these records had their share of 'good' songs, but that's about it.
Most of their records contain a few precious gems, buried under what I often consider to be filler tracks.
I don't hear a single standout song on this.
Then, with Wrong, Nomeansno finally showed the world that they could write an album that blew doors from beginning to end.
The very definition of "inconsistent".
The Day Everything Became Nothing had its title track and "Forget Your Life" (which was actually just an updated version of one of their earliest songs).
Sex Mad contained "Self Pity", "Long Days", and "Revenge".
Weird band, Nomeansno.
Or maybe it's time for the Wright Brothers to finally move on to something else.

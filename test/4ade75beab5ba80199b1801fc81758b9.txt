You see why celebreties and people of prominence feel they can get away with murder.Now, the bad news.
Universal Studios should be ashamed for putting out bargain bin quality discs.
The episodes aired on network TV in the 70's.
No pictures or anything on the discs.
Did the writers win any Emmys?
This DVD has 2 of the very best Columbo episodes.
I must admit, I was hoping Johnny Cash got away.
First, the good news.
When you open the cover, you feel something is missing,especially for $[...].
The points are made without being vulgar.
"Swan Song" and " A Friend in Deed" have excellent story lines, even for today.
Both are very well written.
Excellent Amazon.com price and excellent material, though.
There is no inner leaflet describing each episode.
Child sex abuse,groupies, adultery and domestic violence are handled with tact and class.

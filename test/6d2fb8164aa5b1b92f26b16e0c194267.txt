Apparently the signed copy wasn't much of an inducement to keep this, as mine is also signed.
It is so bad I am in pain.
No wonder.
Crap.
Complete crap.
If there was a lower rating than one star, I would have gievn that.
This book was being given away in the Free box at a local rummage sale.
They are barely made up of whole sentences.
This may be the case for book burning.
What a joke.
I wouldn't offer this crap to a salesrep at an Amway convention.
Honestly.
The stories are not funny, poignant, or moving.
Who is this guy and why would they publish this?
I've read better spam mail than this no talent ass clown can ink out.

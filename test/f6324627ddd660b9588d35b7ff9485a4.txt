...and you will drop it!
The soft rubber absorbs the impact.
Integrated lanyard and safety clip.
I'm glad I found the Foarm brand one.
I notice that Amazon has associated this review to the camo printed case.
I have the all-black case and I have no idea why I can no longer find the black case anymore on here.
My GPS has been dropped numerous times and it is nick free.
Your GPS will still float!
Fits like a wetsuit.
The pefect design.
Much better than anything on the market.
Comes with replaceable protective overlay for the display.
It is the best protection when the GPS gets dropped on hard surfaces or in the water.
I suggest getting others (for PDAs) and use the one included as a template.
I really doubt the black was discontinued and replaced with a camo design.Original review:I stumbled over this while looking for the Garmin brand GPS case.
UPDATE: 3-22-2008 I'm still glad I found this.

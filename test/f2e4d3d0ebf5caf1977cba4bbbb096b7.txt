Do me a favor, just don't get the Intec PSP Safe Case.
99% of all psp owners who have a case have a Playgear Pocket.
I was definitely wrong.
When I test dropped it, I could just feel the psp getting damaged.
If you want a great case, get a Playgear Pocket.
I'm telling you, it stinks!!!
It has the shape of the psp and is a lot less bulky.
A lot of flaws are in this product.
You can charge the psp while its in the case!!!!
You can even put pictures inside the Playgear pocket so you can see them.
It feels like you are just holding the psp, except you have a full proof protection around it.
It is much too bulky, and to tell you, it's not really protecting your psp.
Thank you.
I got this Intec PSP Safe Case thinking it looks pretty good how the psp fits perfectly without any space.
There is a lot of space between the sides of the case, and if you drop the case, it pops open 100% of the time (even from 2 feet above the ground).
It's basically a decal thing.

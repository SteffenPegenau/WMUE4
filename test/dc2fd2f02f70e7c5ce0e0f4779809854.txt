Slow moving and shallow.
Yes, I love nature.
Yes, I love and respect women.
Very weak story.
No, I did not enjoy this book.
Characters were never fully developed.
Seems, from the writer's point of view, that sex and the woman is all-powerful.
I finished it only because I had a cold and had to do something.
Kept waiting for the BIG insight.
The three "heroines" are all named Zena, not Xena, Warrioir Princess.
Never felt magical to me or really spiritual.
Controls man and his actions.
Yes, I'm a man.
Early man and women were much more complex and thought provoking than are found in Circles of Stone.
My advice, skip the book and hopefully there will be no movie.

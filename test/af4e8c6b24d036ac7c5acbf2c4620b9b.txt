Anyways, If you REALLY want a funny anime, i would suggest something like Lucky Star or Azumanga Daioh.
Please go out and buy azumanga daioh or lucky star vol.1, they are much better.
I bought vol.
Yah, I'm done now.
Since there are so many other reviews, you probably know what it is about already.
All my friends who like anime were reccomending it to me, so i thought i would give it a try.
1 and i was not very into it at all.
I bought it at the dvd/music ect store F.Y.E.
Because School Rumble really isn't that great of an anime.
First off, I did not buy this off amazon.
It was a real suprise to me, though, sice i laugh so easily, i did not laugh one bit watching this.
Sorry!
The opening theme gets very annoying after a while, just thought i would point that part out.
Thanks!
Seriously!

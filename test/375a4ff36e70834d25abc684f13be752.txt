Who to do it with.
What it feels like.
"Kickin' It With Your Girlfriend" is Hot, "Slow Wind" HOT- Reminds me of when I was in Jamaica, the man is tellin the truth!
But I agree, the Trapped In The Closet is now old, but the CD itself is definitely RELOADED!
How to do it.
I LOVE IT, LOVE IT.
What it reminds him of.
What it relates to.
Where to do it.
Love It.. R. Kelly is never a disappointment and I am absolutely SHOCKED at some of the Low reviews!!!
The whole CD is just hot..
What it smells like.
THIS CD IS HOT.
What it sounds like.
But that's what makes us individuals :o) "SEX WEED" is just the best, HOTTEST song I've hear (of that genre) in a long long long long time.
How often to do it.
I mean, He does it well, obviously because I think the CD is a success, but still...)
(I give it 4 Stars on Principle.
All he talks about is Sex.

It is THE most beautiful song ever recorded.
Every song is good EXCEPT for "Semi-Charmed Life" "How's It Going To Be", "Burning Man"<---what kind of title is that...and the lyrics "cause i live my life/like a burning man"...what in God's name is a burning man?..., and finally "London".
Most of you are too obsessed with the radio played ones...GET OVER IT.I have to admit, 3eb is one of the best albums i have heard in a while, but Smashing Pumpkins still rock.
Not the best, but most beautiful.
"I Want You" is beautiful.
Those are the songs that matter.
Get off of it!If you like ballads, you'll like #'s 4,7,9,11,12,13,and 14.
"Good For You" kicks.
And all the SP albums.
But i suggets you get Nirvana's "nevermind" instead.
The rest can stay on there.
"Jumper" is awesome.
Then maybe you'll be able to appreciate these guys a little more.-Jeremy M.
People, you must be on crack if you don't like "The Backround".
Not that other crap.

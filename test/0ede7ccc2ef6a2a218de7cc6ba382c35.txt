It's Dragonlance, it's Richard Knaak, and it's got minotaurs.
I get it.
Fortunately I expected a good adventure and it was.
I will say that if you're new to Dragonlance, don't read this one first.
Read the Legend of Huma, and then you can take this one on.It's a fun adventure, but not on par with Huma.
When Kaz is irritated he snorts.
The kender is full of energy and gets in trouble.
It's a good recipe and makes for a nice fantasy read.
Every page he's snorting.And there are some cliches.
The villianous elf fits the mold of a stereotypical baddie.
Knaak is a good writer but he overdoes it some times.
He's crazy and wants power.
We've seen that before.
Unfortunately he's always irritated so it seems he's constantly snorting.
But I would have enjoyed some surprises.
The minotaur is tough as nails and can deliver first rate butt-kickings even after being crushed, speared, drowned, etc.So to sum it up, this book is exactly what you expect it to be.

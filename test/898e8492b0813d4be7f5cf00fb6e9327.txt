Let's not forget the historical facts that could have easily been worked into the story are so skewed and just plain made-up it's sad.The acting is bland - for most of the parts.
the Dodgers.
Demi Moore??
Adultery.
LSD.
Aston Kutcher?
Unfocused and bad.Estevez threw everything (and I do mean everything) against the wall to see what would stick.
Wow - was this bad.
Yikes.I didn't buy or rent - I saw it on cable, and the price was way to high.
Bobby Kennedy is about the only thing that is the tertiary in this film.
Unfulfilled marriages.
Nothing does.CHADS.
Even the clips of him campaigning don't fit in as they could or should.
Depression.The depression comes from the hackneyed script (also by Estevez).
But to be fair - she has little competition: Lindsay Lohan?
Race relations.
It did for me.
VietNam.
Oddly enough, Sharon Stone is one of the better people in it - and she is someone I think is normally talentless.
Is there anyone who said 'no' to a part in the movie?

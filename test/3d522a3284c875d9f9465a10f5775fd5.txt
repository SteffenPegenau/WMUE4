Now the rack part is completely useless.
I've quit pushing the button and am back to scooping manually.
The problem only got worse.
You'd have to nudge it about half way through so it could complete the rotation.
There is no way to crack open the case to clean it.
But alas, this will end up contributing to our ever growing landfill problem.
The rack started to stick during the rack cycle and make this HORRIBLE thump thump sound.
The problem is that litter gets kicked into the motor area and gums it up.
THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP.
I would push the button and just giggle at my lack of scooping.
However, after the honeymoon period ended the love was gone.
I have to manually push the rack thru rest of the cycle.
I was *sooooooo* happy with this for the first two or three weeks.
It gets to the half way point and gets stuck.
*sigh If there were just some kind of shield that would keep the litter out of the motor area this one might have been a winner.

I received it on Friday.
I plugged it into the wall from Friday, all day Saturday, and all day Sunday.
!Not only that, but the reception is horrible.
The flashlight is small and weak.
THAT'S IT!!!!!!
It is way over priced.
It really smells like ass.It only has a rechargeable battery.
The day I opened it I instantly noticed a horrible smell coming from the unit itself.
Do not buy this crap.
This is honestly the worst radio ever.
I wanted to listen to a show on Monday.
It lasted for a totally of an hour and a half.
I know radios for ten dollars that are way better then this.
They say it lasts for four or more hours, but that is a lie.
Today (October 24, 2005), I unplugged it and turned it on.
If you need a radio buy anything, but this.If I could give it 0 stars I would.

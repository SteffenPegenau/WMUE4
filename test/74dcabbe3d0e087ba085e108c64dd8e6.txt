We rented the movie for $[...] at Red Box.
Egads.
Ohmygawd, what a terrible film!
For what?
Left us both annoyed and disgusted.
Both my wife and I love Robin Williams,but he was utterly and completely terrible in this role.
Wefound his character annoying, pathetic and disgusting.
This is supposed to be a comedy?
The couple later reconcile -- no thanks to him-- and then THANK him?
I would have kicked him a few times while he wasdown too.Avoid at all costs.
He spends the wholemovie destroying the relationship of a happy couple through numerouscringe-inducing actions.
Wasn'teven worth that.
His character ispsychotic, and probably a pedophile, with a 12-year old sidekick withhim 24/7.
The bestpart of the movie (well, the only good part) is when Robin Williams'character gets decked.
What were the writers thinking?Terrible, terrible movie.
The writerswanted you to laugh at his antics and find him cute and adorable.

My hands still feel hydrated even after washing multiple times.
It's wonderful.
I'm not one to readily hand out 5 stars, but this one easily earns it.
I've been living with extremely dry skin due to the winter months and excessive hand washing.
I only used a tiny amount of the product (applied it twice a day for the first day or so and now only use it every other day or so.)
My hands were badly cracked and bleeding every day, painful to the point of throbbing.
This product was recommended to me and I was amazed.
Within two days my hands were 95% healed.
This product truly soaked into my skin.
I tried everything: natural moisturizers, coconut oil, olive oil, wearing gloves each night while sleeping, drinking a lot of water, supplements, nothing worked.
No more cracks, blood, or pain!
I couldn't believe it.
The moment I applied it my hands began to heal.
I wish I'd found this years ago.
It is also greaseless.

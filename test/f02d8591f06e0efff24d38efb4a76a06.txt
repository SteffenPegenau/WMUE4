If you don't like Evanescence, you've got something wrong with you.
Hello 4/510.
Imaginary 5/58.
Taking Over Me 5/59.
Tourniquet 5/57.
Going Under 5/52.
My Last Breath 5/511.
The riffs are amazing, and overall, this is one of the greatest albums of all time.
Haunted 5/56.
Whisper 5/5
With the amazing vocals of Amy Lee, the sick guitar playing of Ben Moody, and the rest of the band, this album and band are off the hook.
My favorits songs are Taking Over Me, My Last Breath, & Haunted.1.
Bring Me To Life 5/53.
Evanescence's debut album "Fallen" is the greatest debut since Flaw's "Through the Eyes".
My Immortal 5/55.
Everybody's Fool 5/54.

The problems?The customization of characters is very limited.
It should be.
That's $40 I will never see again.
By the time you get through a few rooms you are so bored you can't stand it.
Oh well lesson learned.By the way the music is pretty good and the movement (slow as it is) is fluid and life-like.
I also have had no problems with crashes but then I have a fairly high end system.I wouldn't buy this game unless you are a very patient person.
It takes forever to get anywhere.
The game action is terribly slow.
It really should be.It isn't.
I reccomend instead Baldur's Gate II.
You might as well start with the pre-made characters for all the thought that goes into it.
You get to create four cookie cutter characters.
A good old fashioned dungeon crawl with awesome graphics sounded like a lot of fun.
I bought this game the day it came out and I have been trying to like it every since.
I have just given up.
I have really been looking forward to a new SSI D&D game.

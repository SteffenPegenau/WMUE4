In total, however, this book is no different than most of the others I have read.
She obviously bit off more than she could chew here.
And I was expecting her to at least attempt to give us a working definition.
I felt like I was reading her droolings.
According to hooks in the introduction: be it through practice or theory, we know very little of love.
Bell hooks obviously did a lot of research, but it was more in quantity than quality in presentation.
None was provided.
And this is only one of the countless wrong steps she took.
I saw hooks'title claiming to have a new vision on it, and was rather pleased.
My grade is D+ bordering on a C-.
The last three to four chapters are the best ones.
Love is one of the most widely topics spoken on or about in any language.
She started to get warm then.
Nonetheless, chapter 3 is titled: Be True to Love.
Since, not only did chapter 1 not set any sort of formidable foundation, but so was two in inconsistency and shallowness.

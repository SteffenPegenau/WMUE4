This version is a "failure of editing."
Somehow they managed to CUT some of the best parts of this film from the UNCUT version.
Please buy the normal version.
Do yourself, your sister, your buddy, your mom, your barista, that one guy from high school, a favor.
That would have been enjoyable.
A bunch of scenes that were cut for very good reasons.
Many of the jokes you enjoyed with your tub o' popcorn and 88 ounce coke have been removed in lieu of longer, dumber, unnecessary scenes, that just won't end!
You know what is in this movie?
How is that possible?
If you liked Talladega Nights in the theater you should NOT buy this version.
Do not buy this film expecting it to be the theatrical version plus some deleted scenes.
By the end of the movie you will start to notice something just isn't right.
Seriously.
Where is the scene when he's a little boy and steals his momma's car?
Not in this movie!
When does that Borat Guy talk about currency for dogs?
Not in this movie!

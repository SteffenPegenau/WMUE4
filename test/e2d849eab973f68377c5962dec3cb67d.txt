A washed out scene like a spaghetti western including the ripped off soundtrack.
A campy chopsuey bloody fight scene.

Japanese anime - yes, Tarantino tosses in animation scenes.
He stuffs all his favorite genres into a single movie mixing visuals, music, and styles from scene to scene.
Film noir.
A stylish martial arts scene.
What was Tarantino thinking?
A dash of campy Charlie's Angels.
This movies is only for Tarantino fans.

I'm sure I'm missing some.
Excessive is what this film's all about.
Oh, did I mention his fascination with spraying blood that gushes from wounds like an uncapped fire hydrant?
Terribly sadistic in places, it generally is lacking in humanity.

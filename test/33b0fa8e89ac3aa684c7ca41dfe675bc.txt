I eventually ended up cutting the pillow open and removing A LOT of stuffing from the neck.
It is impossible to put back on- kind of ironic when this pillow is designed to make life more comfortable for a pregnant woman.
I purchased this pillow for my second pregnancy.
Especially on the neck area.
This pillow is way too over stuffed.
Then had to sew it back up.
that I saved it for my husband to do and it still took a good 15 minutes for him to figure it out.
In addition, the pillow case is THE WORST EVER!
However....
I bought this one after all of the positive reviews thinking I couldn't go wrong.
I have woken up with a stiff neck and headache two mornings in a row.
Very disappointed.
My sister had loaned me a different maternity pillow for my first pregnancy and I loved it!
It was so difficult (and frankly painful with my big belly!)
Yes, it does offer some support and cradles your body.
I would NOT buy this pillow again nor would I recommend it.

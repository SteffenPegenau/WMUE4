Disappointment.
This farcical romantic comedy was neither romantic nor comical.
Yes!
Anger.
He did not.
Embarrassment.
I needed a "feel good" film tonight.
Instead, this impostor develops a midlife mismatched infatuation with a ditz no where near his equal in gravitas.
I never cracked a smile.
Impatience.
Nevertheless, I was determined to endure it to the end - all the while hoping against "Hope" that the dashing Mr. Darcy would eventually make an appearance.
The next time I notice that 30 percent of the reviewers give a film just a single star, I'll save my time and my money.
Even the conclusion is ponderously tedious.
Boredom.
This one triggered a number of emotions but "good" was not among them.
Frustration.

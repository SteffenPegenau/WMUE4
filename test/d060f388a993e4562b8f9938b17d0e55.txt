He is, and always will be my favorite Super Hero.
Every word of it.
I grew up on Green Lantern.
(regardless of the fact that he is a fictional character) I enjoy when hero's fall from grace.
Hal Jordan goes Rouge and eliminates all his friends, allies, and mentors.
Literatue is ripe with Tragic Heros.
I miss Hal's stories, I miss his GL, but I admire him for what he did, and who he was.
I lived and died Hal Jordan durring my formative years.
I feel a lot of the uproar was over the removal of Hal himself.
Yet I belived it.
I was quite surprised by the uproar in the comics industry over this arc.
People had trouble excepting their fallen hero.
Then came this book.
In his position, your damn right I would have killed every mother lovin' thing I saw, even if I was Hal Jordan.
I agree with most reviews in that the story wasn't flushed out enough, it felt rushed, etc.

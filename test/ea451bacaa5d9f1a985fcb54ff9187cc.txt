Sweden Song5.
"Singer" by The Besties is great sexy, summer-y pop.
Something for even the most jaded music connaisseur.Track listing:1.
Pirate Song7.
Prison Song2.
Zombie Song8.
In fact, I loved each song more than the next.
The album was a step progression of new favorites.
I can't decide whether I like the Space, Western, Sweden, or Zombie song more.
Western Song4.
Space Song3.
Theme SongYou are only hurting yourself by not checking out these Brooklyn crooners.
Siren Song6.
Interstellar love, loss, and zombies are the province of their finely crafted pop songs.
If you need to smile in a slightly melancholy yet happy manner, listen to The Besties.

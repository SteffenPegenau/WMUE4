And the stranger it got, the less interested I felt.
Blah!
It was hard to care about the side characters, because they were so bizarre.
is unfamiliar.
This started as a promising story.
The reader needs something familiar to help them relate to the story and characters.
Way too strange and confusing!
I definitely won't read the rest of this series.
I love fantasy and science fiction, but this storyteller forgot something very important.
I couldn't put it down in the beginning.
It was a real story about a real boy in an exciting, intriguing situation.
People don't look like people.
Then, somewhere in the middle, it just got weirder and odder and more confusing.

They are after Eragon (well duh) the villagers hold out.
Just skip to the last chapter or so and wait for the final book in the Trilogy.
Oh yeah that blessed kid is back.
Rowan (his cousin) falls in love with the butcher's daughter.
Big battle dark family secret.
The villagers take the same path Eragon did in the last book.
I wasn't a star wars fan so I didn't notice the similarities really.
What a Ripoff!
Most of the book consists of Eragon walks with troll.
(star wars was a trilogy remember... makes you wonder)
He walks in desert.
Then I waited in eager anticipation for Eldest which meant going bookstore to bookstore looking for a copy/party.
The Razac come and attack.
They love each other.
He trains with jolly old elf rider who didn't exist in the last book.
I absolutely loved the first book Eragon.

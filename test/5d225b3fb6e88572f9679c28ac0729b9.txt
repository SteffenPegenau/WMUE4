They just kind of got in the way.
So I had to tie knots in the rope which may not really be recommended.
PROS: I must say that I prefer the little tray and bumper gaurd because when you put your baby in a doorway, she's going to bounce in every which way.
Tons of laughs.
But when she got to be a taller girl, it just wouldnt raise anymore.
Overall, SHE LOVED this chair.
It held very well to the wall, no worries ever.
We all loved this chair, although didn't care much for the little animals that hung from the side.
This little tray was helpful in keeping her far enough away from the door frame.
CONS...
She's almost two now but I have come back to buy one for my friend.
but I DEFINATELY recommend :)
No injuries ever.
We have normal ceilings and normal height doorframes.
The rope is just so long.
I bought this for my duaghter when she was prolly around 4 months or so.

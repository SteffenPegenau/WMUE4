I bought the first tape, curiously, with no knowledge of what it contained.
It is different.
I no longer consider it a bad EVA clone.
It's is not like EVA.
My first impression, a bunch of whinny loud mouth idiots (to quote Ruri :).
Of course, the loud whinning hasn't stopped, but it became bearable, especially after they nearly explained why everyone yells.
This series got so much deeper.
I also now love Nadesico.
Okay, at first, this series totally disgusted me.
Everything.
After I finished watching the second tape I was dying to watch the 3rd, and now I'm desperate to go and purchase the next 2 as well!
It seemed to be a bad EVA clone.
They explain a lot about themselves and this series when the take about an anime within the show called Gekigengar.
I love EVA.
That's one of my favorite things.
For some odd reason, however, I went out and bought the next two tapes.
Trust me.
This series is well worth the time/money/and effort.
Thank God I did!

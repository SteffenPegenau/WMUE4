So I bought this album from Amazon and I'm kind of groovin, you know rockin out.
Well, come to think of it they were a lot different.
Out of the park.
I mean, the fourth song pops on and its like boom!
Except Phish uses a guitar and my uncle just used an empty canned ham tin, a broomstick, and some rubberbands.
Then, all of sudden out of nowhere, I'm scratching at the friggin walls.
No questions asked.
Thanks Amazon.
Only one or two words were the same.

The song sounded exactly like the one he used to sing to me when I was younger.
Thanks a lot.
Exactly.
The lyrics were also a little different.
Home run.
I thought "holy crap man" this sounds like my Uncle Bootnee Lee (his real name's Tom Snyder but he changed it for obvious reasons).
I like Phish's version better because they don't make me do chores when they're done singin'.

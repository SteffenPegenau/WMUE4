liner notes.
Hence the ding from 5 stars down to 4.
Apparently, this is a part of a series that has to do with food?etc?
This is traditional Irish music with some beautiful harp playing (showcased) on a couple of cuts.
This was about as thin as it gets.
Nay.
You won't get blisters on your rear listening to this, but it's feelingly done.
Fine players all around.
(Harp being an instrument I don't normally seek out).
However, I did recognize Wilifred Horan.
Lovely and laid back.My complaint - I like liner notes.
I don't mind a couple of recipes, but I DO want to know the history of the tunes (who wrote them, etc.)
and a bit about the players.
I bought this because I confused James Keane with Jimmy Keane.
I love!

Carnaval?
Come on!!!!
Acadamy Awards?
What a waste of paper, money and time.
Who's not aware of these events?
New Years Eve in Times square?
This would be great if you love crowds and mayhem.
The suggestions are useless.
Nobel Prize Ceremonies?
Mardi Gras?
The suggestions of things to do are just plain aweful.
It seems to suggest every crowded fair and typical tourist attraction in any city.
Running of the Bulls?
This book is the worst.
It could have some redeaming qualities if it had suggestions about where to stay and how to plan these types of trips, but it does not offer any other information than the dates and location.

Actually, I've put it on every 1th of month.
My dog has been on this products for close 2 years.
Never works!
I hope that is not another money sucker product!
There were many fleas running all over his body.
I'd to go out buy flea shampoo and flea spread.
My daughter washed my dog charlie hair and get him a hair cut.
This year the weather is hot and cold.
He got to go doggy parks a lot.
She thought perhaps I forgot to put Frontline Plus on him.
My friend told me K9 Advantix work better!
It was just a $$$ suckers!
What a stupid product!
She put another one on 9/8.
Still yesterday I saw more fleas and I was getting bites all over my ankles as well.

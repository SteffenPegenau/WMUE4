They say it will work on anything G3 500 or higher.
It had incorrect times for shows.
The other problem is that the tv listing the software uses, is not accurate.
They refuse to provide it.
I strongly disagree!
Other problems include that it locks up often, and you have to unplug the unit from the computer and restart it.
Hello,I bought this and tried to use it on a Powerbook G4 with 512 ram.
The video is choppy and grainy.
You have to email them with problems, and they email you back.....Days later.
Great idea, Poor product.
I reported this and they admited it, and said they contracted the listing with another company.
The eyetv200 did work, but not well.
It wouldn't wake the computer from sleep to record a tv show, like it is supposed to.
This company needs to provide phone contact and improve their product before anyone should buy it.
Most importantly there is NO phone contact provided with Elgato.

Paul Naschy is at it again!
Anyway, this time around, he gets in a car wreck (arranged by his loving wife and her boyfriend) and supposedly dies.
FOTW is alright.
You see, the good doctor wants a man like Naschy real bad!
(mad doctor) named Eva Wolfstein (!!)
She's a sadistic sort w/ an eeeevil twinkle in her eyes!
My kind of woman!
What was that all about??
An extra star for Dr. Wolfstein.
He's a wolfman in facial-fuzz, rubber fangs, and a big Elvis wig!
She wants both a love slave in human form, and a werewolf to cause mayhem during the full moon!
I especially like the drugged hippies in the castle dungeon!
He actually looks more like Wolfman Jack than a true lycanthrope.
It's schlocky to the core, but it's probably supposed to be.
Luckily, the local M.D.
I told you she was mad!
digs him out of his grave, takes him back to her secret lab, and revives him.
Rowwrrr!...

I thought this monster slow cooker would work well with my large family.
Eight hours later....things were so done that I had mush.
Well the problem here is that it cooks too fast.
Veggies get done without an isssue in this appliance.I use this slowcooker now like an extra pot off the stove.
There is nothing slow about this appliance.
Sometimes you need the food to cook SLOWLY.
Yes I filled it up past the halfway point.
By nine that same night, I have a meal for tomorrow.
I have used crockpots for years.
The low setting is like almost medium high on the stove.
I put a stew in on low when I left for work.
This should be named the Spacious Extra Pot that can cook tons of food quickly.
I put five pounds of chicken in at 4 and by 8 I had very done chicken.
I am just glad I did not give away my old crockpot.
On high, it will bubble and boil.
I use it to put tomorrow's dinner in at five thirty in the evening.
The high setting is like medium high on the stove.

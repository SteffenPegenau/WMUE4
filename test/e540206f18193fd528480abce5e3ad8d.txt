I love in Vermont and many of the student's on my campus wear these.
I had ordered the 8 in the other pair and the 7 in this pair.
Sorels used to be the way to go for winter boots, but now I'm not so sure.
I had originally bought a different pair of Sorels but they were too big.
I just received these boots after waiting 3 weeks from the day ordered them.
100 dollars is a lot of money for a college student.
I decided to get the Caribou's instead.
I figured they would be worth the 100 dollars.
I hope they keep my feet warm!
I would send them back, but my other old pair takes in water and I can't wait another 3 weeks for another pair.
Eventually I figured out I could get the insert out and literally squeeze my foot into it and then put it back in to the boot.
It would be nice if these fit.
Now that it's in the boot, and the boot feels big.
I couldn't get my foot in!
I put them on as soon as they arrived.

They are the worst internet company ever.
I have been emailing and calling for 10 days, and cannot get a credit or cancellation confirmation.
Within 10 minutes of placing that order I called and cancelled it.
Do not order from Uncle Jim's Worm Farm.
I returned it unopened.
Today I received the shipment in the mail.
DON'T ORDER FROM GARDENWORMS.COM OR UNCLE JIM'S WORM FARM.
They have ZERO customer service and they lied to me.
They have not answered my repeated emails and requests for credit.
I placed an order on Gardenworms.com and as soon as I had paid, a window popped up that said "thank you for shopping at Uncle Jim's."
It remains to be seen if I will ever get a credit.
The person on the phone who I have talked to twice said it would be done.
95% of the time they don't even answer the phone.
Advertising deception.
The person on the phone said it was cancelled.

I actually give it 3.5 stars.
That's a heavy track.
Ozzy does an energetic and satisfying job with the vocals.
This is quite an impressive live performance from Ozzy Osbourne.
All of the tunes are Black Sabbath songs.
I don't have any favorite tracks.
The other members of the band perform well, also.
All of the tunes on Speak of the Devil are good.
They're all good.
It's well worth a listen.
Ozzy's banter with the audience is really cool and adds a spark to the album.
I prefer the live versions of these Black Sabbath tunes to the studio ones.
This re-mastered version sounds really nice.
Speak of the Devil is a better-than-good live album.
Brad Gillis also does an impressive job with the guitar playing.
It's easy to get into Speak of the Devil.
The guitar playing on the intro of "Symptom of the Universe" is cool.

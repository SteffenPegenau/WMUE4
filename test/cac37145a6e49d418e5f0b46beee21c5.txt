I bought this unit over four years ago.
We have found that the expensive appliances are never worth the money.
Hot water comes out from under the top.
It did not work.
Everytime I contacted Bunn they sent me another carafe.
I tried the cleaning "fix".
As someone else mentioned, it's due to a poor spout design.A few months ago the whole brewer began to leak.
Somedays it's OK.I searching for another brand.
It leaks when it's sitting idle, it leaks when it brews.
The drippy thermal pot showed up immediately.
The lowly Regal does just fine!
Too bad!
I now have four.
They all leak.
The fast brew is its only saving grace.

Period.I am sorry that you had a lover's spat, Steve.
Or Robert Plant without Led Zep.Stephen is talented, but his talent came through with Pavement.
It's like Roger Waters without Pink Floyd.
And I don't mean the "Led Zep" reunion with one or two shows.
Hey, if you need to bring your 'other' band along, charge us another $5 per ticket.
We'll do it & more.
I am sorry you had a 'disagreement' with the band.
Jix?Whatever.
I mean a full-blown tour.
We love Pavement.The Jicks?
We know it's a solo project.
BOOOORING!
GET OVER IT!I just hope that Steve will pull his over-inflated head out of his booooty and realize that the grass was greener WITH pavement.Gee, Steve...
Boo freakin' Hoo.That band MADE you.Show the fans (who pay YOUR bills) some respect and do the 'reunion' thing.
Just don't be a doofus!

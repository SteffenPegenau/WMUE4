Rand fights himself and someone else to a draw.
I think that telling this story is going to take longer than the original events took.
I hope he dosen't expire of EXTREEM old age before finishing this series.
Faile learns humility.
Nynaeve moons over Lan and loses her temper with everybody else.
...and so is Robert Jordan.
And Mat, Mat?
Who's he???
Egwene continues to have trouble convincing everyone that she is the REAL Amyrlin Seat.
!
My predictions for the next book: Elayne has trouble controlling Nynaeve and dosen't want to hurt Aviendha's feelings.
Please, Mr.Jordan, surprise us and give us some meaningful advances in the storyline.
Perrin searches for Faile without success.
Tie up some of the loose ends, hopefully in less than two years!!
If you look at this well written book carefully, nothing really new happened.

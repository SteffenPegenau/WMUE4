the first disc is candiria kicking ass as usual.
i was very very stoked to see the new record out.
as far out as last years record was, this one is even more so.
candiria are truly an original band.
its pretty unique.any fan of metal, hip hop, jazz, or just someone looking for something different should seriously consider shelling out for this album.
completely kicked my ass.
i found '300% density' to be very inspiring last year.
this may be the future.
the second disc though, is a mixture of off the wall, more subtle tunes featuring artist im not familiar with.
.
not a bad thing.
im actually spinning it right now.
im almost tempted to say they are on the verge of genius.
this is hardcore street fusion, totally hypnotizing.its also a 2 disc set.
a mixture of jazz, hip hop, and metal, fused together in a very impressive manner.

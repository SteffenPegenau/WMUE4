I kept telling myself to go on .
.
However, unfortunately, this book didn't seem to go anywhere.
.
.
Perhaps if the author had gone a bit deeper in his explanations and descriptions, and didn't limit himself to a mere 200 pages, something would have come of it.
I'm not too sure about this one.
that in the end it would be worth it.
.
Unfortunately, i feel like the nights i spent reading this book were wasted time.
I tried to go into it with an open mind, especially after being warned that it was a "little strange."
.
Having enjoyed books such as Ishiguro's "Unconsoled" and other Kafka-esque novels, I was ready for anything.
but unfortunately, "interesting" doesn't make a good novel.
.
The story was interesting, as was the transformation of Quinn .
Finally, as I turned the last page, I realized i was wrong .

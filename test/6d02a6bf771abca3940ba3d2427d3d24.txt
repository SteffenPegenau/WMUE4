I suggest you give this a watch to know for yourself.
I waited for the movie to start but somehow it never does.
Maybe.
I heard this film's indisputable.
However , it left me uninspired but ensured about the number of similar films that would prop up in the near future.Am I over critical?
Yet again, I was left disappointed because it failed to thrill me.
There was nothing boring about this film.
There's no review that can actually help you find solid on this movie.
No I'm not void of any sort of exaggeration so as to speak but the concept seemed cramped up.
I'm not watching this again in any case because I didn't find it worthwhile the first time around.
Many say the fact that this movie is so difficult to understand makes it "exciting" and "re-watchable".
Now This is a film a lot of people would swear by.
Atleast not mine.
By the time the end was around I looked at my watch facing the unavoidable feeling of being lost.
I just choose to be so with Memento.

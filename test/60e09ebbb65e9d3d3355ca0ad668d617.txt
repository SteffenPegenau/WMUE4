A 'receiver' as a mysterious cop told his wife.
His wife doesn't know what's wrong with him, but his son knows.
He then saw glimpses of spirits and events that happened in the past.
Kevin Bacon is definitely a good actor.
I liked this more than "The Sixth Sense" because of its characters.
There's a secret in Chicago that's about to be uncovered and a girl's murder will come to justice.
Big mistake.
In this, it does.
Think twice about children who have imaginary friends, they might be ghosts.
Witzky is sick of his pathetic life and doesn't realize what he has.
It just didn't belong there.
Better performances and a better story.
He tried to uncover the mystery throughout the whole movie, but little Haley Joel tried to help a spirit at the end of that movie.
I don't know if I can listen to The Rolling Stones again.
Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) wanted to be hypnotized, so he did.

Theres an occasional catchy riff or two interspersed throughout a song.
.
The keyboards were complex and beautiful.
The guitar work further added to that and made it seem powerful.
Its just so repetative!
There just isn't enough variety between the songs and in the songs themselves.
Thats just my opinion, most don't agree it seems, hehe.
I still hold the same opinion that 1184 was lightyears better and this CD is just boring.
oh well
.
.
The screaming even added to that amazing music already and made it seem intense.
.My favorite songs are Fagning, and Resurrection of the Wild.I have to say that I think 1184 was better in everything.
I don't know but I listened to the whole CD again just so I could edit my review and make it better.
Wow I have to say this is one boring CD.
Maybe I'm to picky?
I'll even add another thing thats bad about this CD, it totally lost its appealing atmosphere were it just drew you in like in 1184.
Whatever.

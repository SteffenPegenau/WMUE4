I guess you could say sometimes it sparks a interest to see if you would feel the same way 40 years later.
But don't forget a glass (or bottle) of wine if you do!
Is it a good film?
I did enjoy it more than I did 40 years ago, so it may worth a look.
I must say it was not as bad as I remembered.
A drama?
We all had alot of laughs because it was very hard to believe that all of the talent involved with making this film could turn out such a piece of garbage.
So if this was such a a piece of trash why would I buy it and watch it again?
A adventure?
But it is sort of a camp classic to sit and watch while having a few drinks or a glass of wine.
It is hard to understand what type of film this is.
I remember well when this film came out and went to see it with friends on opening night.
!
I guess you could say it has quite a bit of it all.
Well no.
A musical???.

If our instinct is to survive on this planet, then how can our existence be wrong?!?
Quinn manages to yet again turn humans into the heavy and all other forms of life into "nature".
.
.
YEAH!!
If not, then we must have been created on and for this planet.
I fully hope everyone is forced to read this book and the book to which it is the sequal at one time or another simply to gain an understanding of how the "other side" thinks.
If humans are not natural, did we come from alien craft?
Mr. Quinn, how do you propose we turn 6 billion people into "gatherers"?
Sheesh!
Get a life.
OH!
If this is the case, then humans ARE NATURAL and therefore what we do is natural if it is instinctive.
.
Maybe we should stop healing the sick!

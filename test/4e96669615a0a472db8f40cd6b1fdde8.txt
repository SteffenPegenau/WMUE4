A very well crafted movie.
This movie made me think a lot of how I look at and treat other people.
Racisim today is a glossed over problem because it does not directly effect most Americans today.
It isn't pretty.
Insight into the mind of what troubles America today.
Ed Norton is amazing.
The use of black and white flash backs was quite interesting.
That is what we should ask of movies today.
Well acted and the direction is great.
Looking for good things from him in the future.
Not only do we need mindless entertainmet but we sometimes need to have our eyes opened up and see what really goes on around us.
We don't see it so it must not be there.
It is graphic and intense which keeps the tone of the move through out this amazing movie.
A real must see.
Truely gripping and compelling.
Chillingly realistic.
A gifted actor.

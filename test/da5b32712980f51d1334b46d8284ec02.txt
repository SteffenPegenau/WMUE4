Maybe that is why the album is called double scale.
Track number 2 is a fantastic one with Bobby Lyle playing a very Crusader like "Southern Wind".
Jump to track number 6 and listen to a song that could be a typical Phil Perry one.
Another chef d'oeuvre.So why only 3 stars ?
Up to now, we're in extasy.
well, because the other tracks aren't really worth it.
Then (o-oooooH !)
Then comes the track "I hear angels", a marvelous slow song, magnificently performed by Tim Owens, Tom Scott, and Byron Miller.
This type of "compilation", where many artists play one track is often hard to rate.In this case, it starts off with all the nergy and power of sax player Everette Harp.
comes a normal cut.
So, depending on what you're looking for and how you measure things, it can be a four star, or a two star cd.
And of course, Mister Joe sample, with "Jungle Walk".
This man is pure energy.
Let's go for compromise then !
Delicious !

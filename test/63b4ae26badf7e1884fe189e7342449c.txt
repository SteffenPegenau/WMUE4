I couldn't believe she flirted with Sean even after she got back the man of her dreams.
I was glad she had a son to complete her happy family.
What a "bad" girl.
If the girl had just gotten off her high horse and given Sean the "TLC" he wanted and so desperately needed, there never would have been...well you know.
I loved the fact that she and Kyle adopted Topaz's and Sean's love child.
I was happy that Nina got a man she could love and respect.
I CAN'T WAIT!
Anyway, I loved the book, and of course you left it open for another sequel.
Keep on doing what ya doing.
I wanted to let you know I just finished reading the book.
I couldn't wait to tell you that it had me smiling, cheering, and angry.
Speaking of Topaz.
And poor misunderstood Jade.
Keisha is the "glue" that holds these people together.
(I must admit, I was hoping it was Germain's, so they could live happily ever after.)

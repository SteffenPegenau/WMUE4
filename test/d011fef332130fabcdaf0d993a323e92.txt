?A good book to stop the patio table from rocking.

See it?
But that's OK. Maybe, if somehow missing a cog on a gear, it will evoke the better formulation in someone else's head.
THEY don't want you to know this because THEY suck your brains or something.
Do you?
Could be wrong.
Not it isn't 'One Theory for Dummies'.
You see?
Huh?
It is a deep deep and praiseworthy mathematical embodiment of real phenomena.
See?
The point is that Terry's work is hugely evolved and argued stepwise through all facets of real world physics.This book, on the other hand, is like a bar room rant from somebody who better not have his keys to the car.
I am not against 'alternative' speculation.Terry Witt has written (Null Physics) a tome that proposes (can't say different as quantum theory is fog with numbers) a visually manageable way to view current observations in physics from quantum to relativity all in one formulation.
All disconnected this's and that's.

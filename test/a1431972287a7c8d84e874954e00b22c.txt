What's in the bunker?
What do the numbers mean?
What is the meaning of the Island?
This DVD set should do good to hold the many LOST, like me, until a second season.
LOST is pure watercooler television.
Most of those expectations weren't fulfilled.
I was drawn into the characters like I never thought I could.I welcome a second viewing of LOST any day.
Good television is credited with many outside conversations.
But, in a way, that's okay.
The hidden mysteries that reveal themselves over time are brilliant.
Few shows build discussion like this one.In the middle of the season, LOST hits a somewhat slow period.
After being drawn into this show from the very beginning.
What is the nature of the beast?Hypothesizing about these mysteries is just one of the great things about LOST.
I had various expectations.
I learned to love this show throughout the season.
But the back story built in the middle episode ends up serving a greater purpose.

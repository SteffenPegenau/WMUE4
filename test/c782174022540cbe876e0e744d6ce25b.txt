How easy can it possibly be?
They heat quickly and completely, no hot spots.
Rinse and dry and put away.
Of course not, but, you are getting very good quality and the price is a fair and moderate one in comparison.
The non stick pans are so nice for the quick items tho'.
If you take care of these they will be around for a long time.
They cook quickly too, clean up is rapid.
No, no, no!
I did that once years ago and ruined a perfectly good non stick pan.
Too easy to clean by hand.
I love these skillets!
You never want to put these in a dishwasher.
Are they cheap, cheap, cheap?
I have my cast iron and would never stop using them.
Excellent quality and workmanship.

At least with my 35mm I can choose the focus point.
No NO, the camera focused on their chests and the faces were slightly soft.
I did some simple "stand up 'em up against the wall" and the manual focus mark said I was focused on their faces.
After I lost the ccd chip Nikon either gave me a new camera, or fixed the old one.
I've got to revise this product downward.
I don't know which.
I probably can with this camera also?
They say the fixed it, if so why did they put those stupid colored stickers back on the body.
Now which menu would that be on.
If anything this camera is not simple or user friendly like the 900 line.
Pretty annoying.
I don't know if this is an adjustment problem or what.
I just never know where it's going to focus.
I was on a tripod shooting at 1/4 sec.
I never know where it's going to focus in a scene.
I've decided that I can't use this camera for any kind of work because of the way it finds focus.

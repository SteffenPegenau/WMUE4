Take it out, and apply a small amount of the newer Fixodent denture cream.
I am a 100% disabled Vietnam Hospital Corpsman.
My dentist wants me to get implants.
I am good to go all day.
With a small amount of adhesive covering my denture, and then a thin strip of Fixodent.
I can get them for free.
I wear uppers and lowers.
I am very pleased, but I took the time to solve my problem, and was not expecting a miracle cure.
I have to always go to the men's room and reapply the cream.
Now I can eat steak, etc.
At first I did have a problem using this on my lower denture, but with a little patience I finally got it down to a science.
Denture cream by itself does not work for me.
This product is great if you are willing to learn how to use it properly for your type of denture fit.
Putting just enough to cover my denture.
Through the V.A.
It is better than going in for implants.
I have a lower denture that cannot be made to fit properly.
Bite down.

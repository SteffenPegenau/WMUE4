I thought her next two albums would be her best.
Control is so-so, the video has a great message, and you kind of see the underlying effect her dad had on their lives.
This album should be bought if your into 80's music or are a pop music fan.
see why these songs made her a star.
My favorite tracks are Nasty and What Have you Don't for me lately!
And there's one or two tracks that are a bit too outdated for me.
I think this has to be one of the classic pop albums of all time, but this is not her best work.
I actually really like all the songs on this cd.
I know people say it's a classic,but I think she's done alot better.
Some of them are a bit corny.
Pleasure Pricnple was always kind of boring to me.
I can def.
When I think of You especially.
Wow some of the best dance pop songs of all time!
There's very little r and b on this cd.

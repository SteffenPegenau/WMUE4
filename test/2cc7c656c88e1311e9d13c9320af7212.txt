But what about that last album they did.
I KNOW WHERE TO GET IT!
Hmmm.
SO WHAT!
You must get it.
It has everything, right?
You know, the one that you can't find.
Insane vocals, Doug and Terrence shreding like mad, super fast drums.
It is only five songs.
Go to vultureent.com.
The one with Dave Culross on it.
You won't be sorry.
They have it.
Sounds great.
It is fantastic.
Go there now and get it.
Yes folks, this would qualify as their best album ever.

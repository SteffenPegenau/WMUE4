I read this book 4 years ago.
And with NOT a single craving or regret.
But this is the exception.
When I closed the last page, I never picked up another cig again.
Wanna STOP (quit my ass)?
Read the book!!!!
My husband did not really want to quit, but he read it any way.
!
I smoked a pack and maybe two if partying and had tried countless times before and always started again.
The book was reccomended to us by 2 friends (heavy smokers) and they are both going 5 plus years successfully.
After reading this book I could immediatly be around my smoking friends and go to bars and did not think twice about it.
Good luck!!
Saved my life!
Last page, never has smoked again (also 4 years).
I have never taken the time to write a review.

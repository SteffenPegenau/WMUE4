I spied my pan on Good Eats.
Until this one.
Hey, if Alton Brown uses it, it must be great!
And there's also a larger size of this same pan for those who need a bigger size.This pan has been wonderful.
And if you have any further doubts...
The bottom of the 'non stick' pan fails and burnt on stuff refuses to come off without taking the finish with it.
Inevitably, they all come to the same end.
This one washes clean every time.
And then the rust... rust in the bottom of the pan and rust on the pan rack.
I've bought so many pans and inevitably this is what would happen to each of them.
The rack is rust free.
Over the last several years I've gone through roasting pan after roasting pan.
The finish is just as good as when I bought it, a year later.
I absolutely love it!It is smaller than the previous pans I've owned, but I can still easily fit five pork chops on it.
Or a large turkey breast.
Or a huge ham.

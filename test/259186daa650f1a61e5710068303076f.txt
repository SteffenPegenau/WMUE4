This one is the first of the series that we didn't like very well.
It was as though Sue Grafton forgot to finish the story.
This book is definitely not up to par for Grafton.Corrine and Ray
We pray this book is not the first of her works that a new reader may pick up.
We hope so.
Up until "P Is for Peril" they were all very engrossing and we could hardly put them down till we were finished.
Is she joking?
Her previous works were excellent.
We hope and pray that she has not forgotten how to write!
And the ending was unlike any of the previous books.
We have read all of the Sue Grafton Alphabet mysteries.
We had trouble staying with it.
"Q" should give us the answer.It is rather scary what Sue says in her statement on the copyright page.
We would hope they would want to start with "A".
If they do, they will get hooked as we were, and have many great books too read...till this one.

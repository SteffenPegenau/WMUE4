I try to loosen it an d it cracks.
The pictures show 'kaiser in these awesome poses.
Now it's here.
Of course it was later replaced by Great Mazinger and further by the ultimate reincarnation Mazinkaiser.
The bending of joints is hard.
It was awesome to see this valiant machine powered by Koji Kabuto take damage from so many battles and keep going.
I glue it together and finally acquire some poses.
I'm a fan of Mazinger since I saw the original series back in the 80s translated in Spanish.
I drop the sword and it breaks.
Revoltech sounds like this awesome new way to pose figures.
So much for the ultimate machine.
The detail is amazing.
The arm... is stuck.
The toy is so small that you just know the box is where it belongs, not in your hands.
But it's not the experience Revoltech promised.
The extra arts are awesome.
It could never replace the original in my heart but I couldn't resist owning it.So here I am a few dollars short anticipating its arrival.

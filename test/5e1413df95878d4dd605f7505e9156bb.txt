Just because it is a fantasy world with magic, etc, doesnt mean that someone can't be named Jack or Tod.
Ok.
I just read the Game of Thrones.
Unfortunately, Jordan seems like a 1st grade writer in comparison.
His narrative is boring and details are abundant in areas that done matter or create any sense of a rich world.
Sorry to be so negative, but I am hoping to spare you....
...
his realism, storying telling are awesome!
I should have known better for 2 reasons: the student was a doofus and I tried reading this book years ago and threw it away because I couldn't get into it.Save yourself some trouble and read something else.
I really don't know much about the character of the protagonists and I am through the 1st novel.
How about Tim the Enchanter?
Seems so simple in comparison.
G RR Martin is a fantastic writer.
Also, the overly complex made up names are just plain dumb.
.... anyway.I bought this book at the advice of a student who told me that it was "GREAT!"

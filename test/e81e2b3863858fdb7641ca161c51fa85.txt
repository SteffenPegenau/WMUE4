No real purpose.
Usually I can force myself through a book.
I read about 60% of this book.
Just walking and killing.
I have no clue why this has so many good reviews.
I'd think maybe it gets better in the end except so many people feel the exact same way I did that I have to say I must be right and it's not worth it.
It felt like a dungeon crawler video game.
I have no idea.
Believe me I tried.
Maybe there's plot eventually.
It's just walk walk walk and then fight fight fight.
None of it seems to have a purpose.
Sometimes I continue reading when everything in me says MOVE ON and I'm rewarded but honestly I couldn't talk myself into finishing it.
I could not finish this book.
All that I read of it was the main character traveling and then fighting battles he shouldn't be able to survive and yet somehow does, then he travels some more, gets into some more craziness he shouldn't get out of alive and then more traveling.

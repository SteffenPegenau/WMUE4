For a while I didn't like them, thinking they were overhyped,epecially by MTV, high school(which I'm in),etc.
But I digress.
Keep up the good work and rock on KoRn!
Ohh... and I think there's a lot of industrial as well as metal.
I look foward to hearing their self-titled debut and Life Is Peachy.
Yet though the rap songs are rather weak.
I especially liked the musicbox on D.B.E.
Justin,Seed,and Cameltosis were alright.
I also liked the bonus song.
I really dislike Ice Cube.
!
Then, I listened to this album and I really liked it.
This was a good CD.
I dispise most rap music, and I don't like it's usage on Children of Korn, All in the Family, etc.
Although I like the genre of funk/rap-rock, I don't think it works for Korn and Limp Bizkit especially(LB).
It gave me some more respect for KoRn.
The songs I really liked were It's On,Got the Life,Freak on a Leash, Dead Bodies Everywhere,Pretty,B.B.K., and My Gift To You.

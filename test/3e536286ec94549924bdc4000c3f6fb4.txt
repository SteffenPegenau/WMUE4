I wait.
this time i am going to ask for a new replacement unit, not a refurbished one.
it warns me.
perhaps this time it will work.
which for me has been two days over the past three weeks.
when it is working, that is.
now i will call again, wasting another $14 to ship the unit back to them to replace.
Tivo/Phillips people sent me a refurbished unit (in only a week - very timely) - the new unit worked for 2 days, then crashola.
well, my first Tivo unit came DOA - apparently the hard drive cable was not connected to the system board.
it sits.
it tells me politely to wait for 3 hours whilst it attempts to recover.
when it is working, it is phenomental.
they tell me to "let it sit for 24 hours to rebuild itself."
"A serious system error has occurred."
nothing happens.
nothing.
i call Tivo.
sigh.
i wait.

In fact, it was worked so well, I am very, very surprised.To put it simply, this is a fun toy.
I was even worried about the IR instead of radio control, there has been no problem.
A great flying toy!
Yes it mostly flies up and down and spins.
It doesn't take long to charge up and then fly all over again and again.
I understand if it just plain didn't work, but what does everybody expect from this pint-sized chopper.
I had it hovering and flying in less than 30 minutes.
I have had it for less than a day and I want more.
It is not supposed to be a stunt heli with loops and rolls and such.
It is not a model aircraft.
So what?
I really don't understand why anybody would be upset with this heli.
I have crashed it so many times now I lost count, it still works like new.
It is a flying toy.
It is also greatly affected by air movement and yes the battery does run down fast.
Yes, I have to do the trim adjustment of the tail every few crashes, so what that takes 5 seconds to do.

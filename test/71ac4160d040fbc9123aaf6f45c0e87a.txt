I bought this last Christmas.
I ended up with crackers rather than tortillas.
I did and they sent me a new one.
My new machine doesn't press as thin as the old one.
If you try to brown the tortillas, they will be crisp.
If the company would set the temperature higher so they will brown and cook quickly, it would be wonderful.
The new one isn't much better.
Cook them very briefly on each side.
I complained to the company.
I followed the instructions to the letter.
The secret is not to brown them.
They told me to send it to them.
They are on the thick side.
The griddle doesn't get hot enough to brown them.
They are nice and round.
Then brown on a separate hot griddle.

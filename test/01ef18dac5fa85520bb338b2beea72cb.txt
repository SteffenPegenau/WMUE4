At least the game is guaranteed to WORK everytime.
Hmm... so far so good.
Happy Holidays...you've been warned.
3) It IS cheap.
Buy the kids a Playstation game, you'll save ten bucks and they'll probably use it more.
Both in price and in quality.
I can think of a lot better things I can do with [my money]!
It's not even a good present for a kid if they can't use it.
Let's see, where to begin?
This camera is HIDEOUS!
I know, how about: 1) The camera is deceptively good-looking.
5) (This is the important one) The program would not recognize the camera even though it was all hooked up correctly.
I was robbed.
Not a good trade-off.
It's light, small and is ergonomically designed.
Ok, at 320 x whatever, we know the quality is going to be awful, but not this bad.
2) Although it's light, it feels CHEAP.
4) The software is lame.
Sure, I know it only cost ..., and the packaging LOOKS nice, but it should be a crime to dupe people into buying this.

Hey everybody jump on the corporate bandwagon!
And don't even get me started on their newly lost Ska influences.
All I want is more... and Join the club...!!!
This band is starting to sound more like Blink 182 and other manufactured pop-punk crap every day.
Listen to Reel Big Fish!!!
So don't waste your money!Well all I can say is, if you LIKE listening to music that sounds like everything else and is completely hackneyed and unorigional...then this is the album for you!
Join the club!
Can't you hear what they're singing about???
And am I the only person who isn't completely dense?
Trendy...
(Come on...Where have you been...)Your time is better spent listening to Less than Jake, Streetlight Manifesto or Catch 22(I'm assuming you like Ska).
Sure when you listen to a couple of their songs, they have an okay sound, but all of their songs sound the same, even on other albums.
Sellout... well they have.
Come on!!!
They want to be.

She became a knock-out.
It's great, and you'll love it.
I had that done.
Halley found it.
Her one biggest wish in life was to be as beautiful as her sister who was model and she, Halley, was just a dull girl.
This was a really great book.
If you want your book autographed, they will do that too.
I loved how it had to do with this rock that fell to earth.
When she found the "loverock" as she calls it, something told her to put it under her pillow and her wishes would come true, and that's just what happened.
It's a very good story and I've never read anything like this before.
Also, if you want to get in touch with the Author, their e-mail address is in the back and they actually write to you personally.
Well, I don't want to spoil this story for you.
Well, all I can say about this book is buy it today and don't delay!
So buy this book.
No form letters.

We all had this exact experience.
I have the 2420 .
.
the 8825's predecessor.
Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on ME!
Called Customer service and they said to just reboot the system.
One would always have the problem.
When I first got it, I thought it was great.
I like the looks and functions on the Siemens, but my experience, echoed by those who have apparently purchased the 8825, makes me fearful to replace my old junk with new junk.
Switched handsets around.
.
Within weeks, we all experienced what can only be decribed as "garbled" conversations .
.
My partner and a close friend both got them on my recommendation.
like we were talking underwater.
Cleared it up for a week or two.

The next thing you know he see's it glowing.
I think I've told you enough of this book.
If someone asked if I could rate this book one through ten I would give it a eight.
She had something for him, a shrunken head, that was cool.
She was a friend of his aunts.
I like on page 71 he is sinking into sand just like in his video games, if they sunk into sand they lost.
First there nice but then they get a little strange.
The shrunken gives him these powers.It is scary in the most of the book.
he flies to the jungle.
That's pretty freaky.
Then he get's invited to come visit his aunt.
In one scene he thinks he hears his aunt right behind him but I won't tell you.
then he finds out he has powers.
They all work there.
His aunt's name is aunt Benna.
Anyway, he goes in the jungle and to a lab.
Then a lady comes to the door.
This book was really exciting.I like how there really into video games because i like them too.
There are many people there.

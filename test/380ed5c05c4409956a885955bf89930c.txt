Again fantastic in the kitchen and foyer but it couldn't maneuver in the tight places behind the toilet.Overall great product.
The bathrooms went very well on textured tile.
It didn't take much to clean it up with a paper towel, just wish I didn't have to.The swivel head is great.
It worked extremely well in the kitchen on the vinyl floors.
It actually ended up pushing all the fine dust against the edges.
Next was the foyer with ceramic tile.
I kind of miss the pinesol smell that gives me a sense of accomplishment.
Got my steam mop today.
Get's into all kinds of places.
I think it beats the mop and bucket.
I guess clean floors will have to do.
The mop cloth doesn't really pick up.
Not as well as the kitchen but viable.I will say that you need to sweep really well.
All in all I found it to be a good product.
It worked extremly well there as well.

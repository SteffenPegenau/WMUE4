Kath and Michel start dating.
Will Kath and Michel ever see each other again???
Then one day Kath and Michel are forced to seperate.
Kath's parents make her go to a summer school for a job.
Kath and her friend Erica go to a new years party and meet a guy.
should be for mature teens and adults.
I would recomend this book to a cirtin age group.
They both have to go to differnt states and are sparated for seven weeks.
I rated this book a four because it was a good book, but I woldnt read it again because of the graphics.
Kath has her very first experirence with a guy, and Michel has the time of his life.
His name is Michel.
They love each other so much that they say i'll love you forever.
they write every day to each other.
This book is a heart warming tale by Judy Blume which expreses the first experience of true love.
I do think this book should be band because of the graphics.
Michle has to go and help his uncle and help him lumber wood for money.

I'm just glad I only burnt $5.99 on the thing.
The hinge at the back broke.
I picked one of these up at a local Big Lots for $5.99.
The plastic seemed pretty heavy and sturdy to me.
I'd give this thing a negative score if I could!!!
BOY WAS I WRONG!
If I could find an email address for these guys they'd certainly hear from me!
I had 15 more little piles of corn masa dough!
Take my advice- AVOID THIS PRODUCT!
Aagh!
I kept using it as best I could, pushing it down without the handle with the weight of my body.
I mixed up the dough according to the recipe on the corn masa bag, separated it into 16 little lumps, put the first lump of dough in the press, pressed down the handle, and CRACK!!!
I managed to squash out 13 extra small, extra thick tortillas with the crippled press then CRACK!!
What was I to do?
The handle snapped right off and pieces went flying!
I had to roll the last one out by hand.

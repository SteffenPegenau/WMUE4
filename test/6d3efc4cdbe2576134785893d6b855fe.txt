Now i have 96 dvdrs just sitting there, they might as well go in the trash.
I guess you get what you pay for.
Then i burned another disc which completed but my ps2 couldn't read it.
It is better to spend the extra money for a good brand, at least you won't be like me and spend $25 for absolutely nothing.
Then i tried to burn another one and my ps2 didn't read it.
The discs also seem alot different than my sonys.
Then i burned a movie and it wouldn't play in my dvd player.
But i still wasted $25, which i am really mad about.
I bought these TDKs when my sonys ran out.
But tdk's dvdrs really suck.
The TDKs seem alot thinner and cheaper.
I can hear my burner struggling to burn these discs.
I tried burning an ISO on the first disc and i got an error.
They were way cheaper than the sonys and i've used tdk's cd-rs which worked great.
Useless.

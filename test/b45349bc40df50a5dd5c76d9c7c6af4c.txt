Very old costumes, and time line.
no wait, i LUST you!
But my favorite adult actress Lolana, makes up for that.
lol
:) 5 Stars for Lolana, and -2 stars for the movie.
So add or subtract that all up, 3 stars.
That alone makes the movie almost completely unwatchable.
Second, i would like to say that Lolana is in this movie!
if they made a new setting type one, 1990'+ i'd see it.
:)Where ever you are Lolana, I love you!
I think if the director and or producer made a movie with a 2000+ or even 1990's setting, they'd probably make a good movie.
Well, they better put Lolana back in it!
But this one, set in early times, really sucks.
The movie is set in the 1st century.
Such a babe, a hottie, her alone is worth the purchase of this movie.
First off, i want to say that Lolana is in this movie.

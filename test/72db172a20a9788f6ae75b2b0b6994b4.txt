Just thought I'd let it air dry over the next few weeks, but the water never really left the inner workings, and now the watch is dead.
Well, I wore it all day at a water park, and got water inside.
It just hasn't lasted.
Initially, the watch from the factory wasn't produced real well...it broke within a few months.
I don't want to spend another $30 to send it back to be repaired again.
That's $30 for a $35 watch.
The battery isn't dead, but the watch itself is.
Well, I did it...sent it off to Florida, and it came back in great shape.
The watch says it's water resistent to 50 meters.
So I'm reviewing a product that was supposed to last 10 years, but lasted three.
Only problem is that it costs $30 to repair it.
I've been using it pretty much every day since then.
However, Invicta has a pretty good repair program.
Overall, I like the solid feel of this watch.
So...I guess I'll be looking for a new watch.

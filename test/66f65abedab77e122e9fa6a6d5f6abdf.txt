The perfect gift for.... (I don't want to give away too much).
Why is he doing a favor for the murderer?
Isn't the guy going to the electric chair?
And the final words -- the beginning of an exciting new...for....
But...doesn't anyone else think the ending is very strange?
The conversation with the guy on the previous pages is also weird.
I suppose an explanation is that he knows that the guy is completely crazy, and he wants the final confession, which he gets, but this is not made clear.
Janeway, have you forgotten about the burning car?
I don't get it....
Exciting new beginning?
This is a double murderer who tried to burn Janeway alive (or dead).
The guy murdered two people and tried to murder Janeway twice.
This book is ok, but just barely ok. No, It's not as good as the other ones.
And Janeway is doing him a favor?
Perfect gift?

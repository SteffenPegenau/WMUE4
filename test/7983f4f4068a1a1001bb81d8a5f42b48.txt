IMO he was a useless hero.
If you read this book for the mystery and suspense it's pretty good.
The killer and suspense part of the book was interesting.
He was a jerk to her for most of book.
I understand that he was grieving over his dead wife but that was 4 years ago.
The book could have gone on without him.
I have no idea why she was so in love with him.
He didn't do anything to help solve the serial killer case because he was too busy moping.
He moped around for way too long.
I'm not a fan of some of the killing scenes because it was a bit gruesome at times.
Her only weakness was the hero.
If you read it for the romance you'll be disappointed.
I like the h. She was a pretty smart and tough character.
The h and her boss were the ones that did all the work while the H sat back and felt sorry for himself.
He is definitely not the "save the day" kind hero.

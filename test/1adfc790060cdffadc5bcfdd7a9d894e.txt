It had to.
Now, while this may be a bonus for someone who may be visually impaired, I found it to be very boring.
I was indeed absolutely wrong.
There was nothing informative such as problems they had to overcome, or camera lenses.
But definitely watch the film.
The director basically tells us what's going to happen in the current scene through out the entire film.
Don't waste your time.
Okay, let's clear this up... From a purely entertainment standpoint, I loved this movie.
I kept expecting it to get better.
I know what you're saying... "Why didn't you turn it off?"
:)
There were no funny tales of things that happened on this day or that.
I almost fell asleep.
Oliver Platt is a comic genius, and many don't realize he has a part in this film.
The only reason I took two stars away from this DVD is the horrific commentary.

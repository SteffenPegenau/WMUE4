I waited on the phone 35 minutes to talk to a tech, who told me to try fixes I was aready aware of, or already tried.
Images scan but show up with vertical lines that run the legnth of the document.
Not to mention the unit is slow.
Iv'e had nothing but problems.
I invested a great deal of time between e-mailing and reading at their tech support site, No Help.
From the looks of the reviews other people have had the same.
Trying to "save as" scanned documents produces error dialog.
We'll see.
God, I should have checked the reviews first.
The disc seems to be currupt, because it was impossible to load Photo Suite that came with the unit.
This things going back in a hurry.
The scanner hasn't worked properly since the day I got it.
I bought this scanner on the internet.
Thats right yours truly.
Oh, here's the best part, guess who gets to pay the shipping for the return?
I was told I'd be reimbursed.

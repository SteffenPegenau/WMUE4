This is totally unacceptable that the refund has taken this long.
I did that in good faith.
I was very disappointed as it was to be a gift.
!
I returned the book and was told on October 18 via email that I would be refunded.
It took ten days to arrive (not typical for Amazon).
I opened the book and it was obviously used.
The refund could take up to ten days.
The supposed new book arrived in a crumpled horrible looking package.
I thought I was dealing direct with Amazon which I have only had wonderful customer service.
Cover was worn and had a tear in it.
Be careful of this company!!
I will be very careful in the future to make sure I am only working directly with Amazon.
I ordered a brand new book in early September.
They asked me to take off unfavorable information.
As of this writing, Oct. 28th, I still have not received my refund.
I am reposting my unfavorable review.

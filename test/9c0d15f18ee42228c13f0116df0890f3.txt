I think they could of done a little better.
The next tracks are ok, but they kind of odd.
Unfortunately, i do not own any of their cds...
The Used is a totally rad band.
Needless to say, their first album was better, but IN LOVE & DEATH is actually pretty good.
Overall, a pretty good follow-up to their first album, but it could have been improved.
Just the tune of the songs, i guess.
then there's track 9, the best song on the whole cd with heavy guitars and screaming.
the last three tracks are pretty good, no complaints.
Either you like it or totally hate it.
They were so bad and just skipped them because they're rather annoying songs.
The first three tracks are pretty good, but tracks 4 and 5 are horrible!
If you wanna get this album go ahead.
Totally rad!
BUT i have listened to both their cds all the way through (well... almost).

It's a great collection.
And there are no bonus-DVD-Materials also.
And of course I enjoyed all their videos and songs recorded on that DVD.
Videos, that were released later are very good.
BUT!!!
Elena.
I have the Videotape with this compilation also and I think that picture quality is much better their.
It's an exactly copy of the Videotape, simply.
You get the feeling - you are watching a second or third copy of a video recorded from TV on a videotape!!!
The picture quality is more than poor!
Hi, I'm a great DM-fan.
It's terrible!
If you are a great DM-fan you have to buy that DVD, but I just want you to know what you get when you'll buy it..... Don't make great illusions.
I was fully dissapointet by that DVD.
I was very surprised, that such a great (one of the greatest ever) band as Depeche Mode can release a DVD like that.
All their videos up to 1991 are recorded in such a terrible quality!!!!!

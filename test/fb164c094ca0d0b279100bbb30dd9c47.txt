Tried b-n-law's house.
Spent 2 hours with webtv tech trying different codes w/o any luck.
Webtv tech removed it from his location and added mine.
MSNTV doesn't have any manufacturers building new WEBTV units.
Buyer beware!
Finally removed former owner's (seller) phone info and log on data installed on unit.
Have to aim wireless keyboard level with unit.
Even my old web eye doesn't work with this unit.Classic webtv users are in for it.
Another 30 minutes of different codes and it started working.It works, it works!!!
On phone with webtv tech 3 hours trying lots of different codes.
1st - Like-New <ha> refurbished model with a soft modem didn't work on my phone line.
At least the main unit.
He suggested a different house.
Web eye uncooperative!
Users have to rely on used equipment which may or may not be up to standard.

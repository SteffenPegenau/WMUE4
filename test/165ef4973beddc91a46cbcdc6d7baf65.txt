Ok. Kool.
And I semi-liked that Theseus part.
Harry Potter, Or inside the walls of Troy.
Some parts of the book were good.
Also, there was a typo in the book.
They should have described the attire of the peeps more.
Which is better?
If she put two sections, she should have made a mans view and a womans view.
The cover was kool, and dat illustrator did a good job.
To me Harry Potter is better, but I am not reviewing that book.
It said there was korn imported from asia minor, but really there wasn't.
This book waas otay, but she should have kept the story to Helen.
Inside the walls of Troy, an interesting book, and fun filled with minimal action.
I didn't like Cassandra's story too much, it was boring.
The girls bak then wore toppless clothes but Clemence did not described that.
I liked the book(a little).

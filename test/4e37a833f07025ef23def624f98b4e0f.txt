Maybe while cleaning or in the car on occasion.
Will I promote it, NO.
Rock bands do make ballad albums, or twists to their music.
I had the same reaction as most did ..." what the H@#$" is this?!!"
John has an amazing voice and all musical talent that has never been truly showcased.
BonJovi is and always will be a "rock" band.
I'm from Jersey and know his roots.
Will I listen to it?
Just don't do it with the classics.
I have been a fan since 1983 and Runaway.
Can't wait for the next RIGHT album, with all LEFT music, just not this.
I still can't tell if I like it or hate it, giving it 3 stars.
Come out with a BRAND NEW version of their music with new songs, that way we diehards don't pass out when we hear our favorites remixed.
I just can't grasp this new twist.
I will buy the CD, for all true Bon Jovi fans have to have the whole library.

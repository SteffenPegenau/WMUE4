When number 3 gives out I think I go for a cheap disposable desk type model and plug into a 12V/110V power inverter in my vehicle.
Paper jambs, multiple sheets feeding, print carriage movement obstructed.
I am on my THIRD HP450CBi printer in 9 months!
I keep it clean and in its own protective case.
Just plug in a USB cable.
Forget IR.
Durability is questionable.
I heavily use the HP 450CBi daily.
Good Luck!
Battery life is good.
No Bluetooth as advertised.
Print speed is acceptable for a portable.
all with similar results.
Print quality is good.
Usually print 75 to 100 pages of Docs per day.
I have tried many different types of paper based on quality, brand, thickness of paper, inkjet, multipurpose, etc.

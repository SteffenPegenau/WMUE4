On June 21, I called Virgin Mobile because phone would not stay charged.
Overall review is F- don't waste your time
Said we can only send you another replacement.
Phone only stays charged 36 hours without use!
Said it was "normal" to charge every night.
Activated replacement phone July 1, after 1 week, the exact same problem -- phone does NOT stay charged.
Told me nothing wrong!!
Called Virgin Mobile again.
Box states standby charge = 9 days.
NO reason for battery draining all the time except its a piece of pure junk.
By the way, the service area for my location is fair to good.
I said "false advertising?"
I purchased this phone with minutes on June 12.
Virgin mobile: no comment.
Virgin Mobile NOT sympathetic, said nothing they can do, REFUSED to refund money for phone or minutes.
Replacement phone received June 26.

I just wouldn't recommend reading both.
I couldn't seem to keep track of what was going on because I kept trying to reference the first book.
Not sure why King took this tack for these books.
A hero in the first book could be the bad guy in the second book.
I wish I had.
I would give the first one I read 4 stars and the second one 2 stars, so they average 3.
I can't recall which King (Bachman) book I read first, The Regulators or Desperation.
The second one I read was confusing as heck.
It's like King took all the characters, put them in a blender, and came out with the new book.
The first one I read was good, interesting and a lot of action.
Stick to one or the other, and you should be happy.
Strange.
Overall, each one is a fun King story.
The story is the same, the characters names are all the same, but now their characteristics are all different.
If you like King, you should enjoy them.

So I'm reviewing this CD as an objective listener.
To be honest tho, this guy could be great...his flows are pretty good and the beats is aiight.
I DJ too.
I listen to mostly west coast rap.
He claims a lot to be the new west coast but like i said, hes the NY new west coast.
Like TI.
And shade sheist is just another MC out of 100 brought to you by Artist and Repertoire.
So there ya go.
This guys the Fabolous of the west coast...in fact ill bet if you read transcripts of their lyrics without hearing the songs you wouldnt be able to tell them apart.I dislike it when people who are popular in NY get their whole region on their backs.
So I've heard a lot.
But if he had some good cali beats and the freedom to write whatever he wants it would be a lot better.
This CD is no more than bubblegum.
DJ Clue?
TI isnt the king of the south hes the NY king of the south.
Fabolous?

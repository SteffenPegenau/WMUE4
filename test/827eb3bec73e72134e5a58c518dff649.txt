This book is nonsense - a waste of time.
Thankfully this book came to me in a big cardboard box with lots of other loaners...
The review from Newsday "[McCurty]is one of the few male authors who can write convincingly from the woman's point of view."
I'd need REALLY good popcorn and plenty of it.
RUBBISH!
Imagine this in living color at your local Cineplex!
And an aside, the dustcover...
Did I mention repetitive?
Repetitive.
Pointless.
I have never read his work before - though I've seen screen productions of several.
On the contrary, his female characters are demeaning representations -insulting and unconvincing.
I struggled through this novel thinking that I must be missing something... afterall, LARRY MCCURTY is a Pulitzer Prize winner!
Did he really write this???
Did I say repetitive?
Where was this man's thesaurus???
Boring.

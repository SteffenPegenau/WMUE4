I read - a lot.And I'm not that picky.
She is simply the best fantasist writing today.
I stuck with Goodkind and read every novel in this series.
Period.
Obviously, I'm a completist (OCD will do that to you), as well as a glutton for punishment.Before you click "add to cart," do yourself a favor and check out anything and everything written by Robin Hobb.
I devour books.
I love fantasy.
Ever.
I don't think I've ever had as negative a visceral reaction to fantasy, and literature in general, than I had when reading these books.

I wish I had the last six months of my life back.
George R.R.
Yes, they were that bad.
I simply cannot recommend this series to anyone.
There is a depth and complexity to her characters and world building that Goodkind never quite gets his pen around.
I teach high school literature.
Martin is also stellar, and his "Ice and Fire" saga is captivating.Taste is subjective, and I know the positive reviews are heartfelt.

One size fits most makes me nervous.
Not too many Obe Wan Kenobe costumes out there.
Found this one on may different sites and was cheapest on Amazon through 7th Avenue Store.
Material is as expected.
This fits great and still has room for someone bigger.
Jedi clothing isn't meant to be fitted.
This was not the case.
When I place my light saber on it, it weighs it down and I'm afraid it's going to rip.
Will have to put string or another belt with it to hold light saber.
Great Jedi look without breaking wallet.
Looks good, but a little weak.
Only real complaint is the belt.
I'm 5'7, 170 lbs and most "one size" items are too big.
Overall I'm satisfied with this product.
A little cheap so be careful not to rip it.

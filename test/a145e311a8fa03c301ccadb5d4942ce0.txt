Very close to it.
sort of close to flamenco.
Only one or two are nice.
!
Try him, you will forget oscar and everybody else.
the guitar sort of begs wanting something which captures in your heart.
His music really has passion.
rest just goes on.
he is out of this world.
He is really a professinal.
He make pure melodies.
I know this is not pure flamenco, but the tunes should be there.
He is the master composer!!
I listned to this cd.
He makes melodies.
No thrash.
its ok. the mElodies are ok, not that good.
He is really a genius in composing.
I suggest that people who like this type of music should try Armik.

All of the gravitas, the drama, the humour, the fun was drained out.
You just won't believe how mind-bogglingly bad it is.Take the original book.
Argggggh!
The dialogue is butchered.
The timing is horrible.
Enjoy the TV series.
Avoid this movie, this Hollywood black hole absence of entertainment.
Go with the books and laugh.
Enjoy the BBC radio series.
Tie together things into a neat, stupid, cliche plot that doesn't relate to the original.How did this movie get made?
Take a few flakes and add in some unnecessary Disney-esque characters and a love triangle.
Put it through the blender.
All are missing.I'm surprised but the original, low-budget BBC TV series blows away this Hollywood crap.
Ok, this movie is bad, really bad.
This "production" doesn't live up to the word "movie": a movie needs characters, plot, setting, DRAMA, ENTERTAINMENT!

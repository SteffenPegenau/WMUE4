"Days like These" is really energetic, too.
is a really nice ballad.
The album cover is cool, also.
All four of the songs are listenable.
It could have been better, though.
It sounds like I don't like this compilation, but that's not completely the case.
"Am I in Love?"
"Sole Survivor" and "Here Comes the Feeling" should have been included.
Then and Now is good.
While I think that what's on it is decent, I also believe that it doesn't have enough meat to it.
The songs that are included are good, though.
Just including two songs from Alpha wasn't good enough, either.
I like the four new songs that they recorded for this album.
Then and Now leaves out a few songs, but it is still okay (just a bit incomplete).
Worth a listen.
There should have been more songs included from the previous three albums.
More than just one song from Astra should've been included, too.

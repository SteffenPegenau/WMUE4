The author could have written the same information on just 100 pages.
Then his wike asks him what they should do about it.
im serious.
then his wife says the letter of course.When I read this, I thought, Damn this book sucks!DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!
It does not make sense, it is really boring.
like right at the beggining, the protagonist recieves a grave letter from johhannesburg.
I repeat, you will regret it.
Do not waste your money this book.
Please look at other books instead.
Nothing happens, there is so much unneccesary writting.
Then the protagonist responds DO ABOUT WHAT?
This is the worst book ever written.
The author has written the book in a really stupid way.
Do not buy this book.
you will regret it .

Okay, lets start with the controls.
Cool weapons as well!
When I picked up my copy of this game [only for 9.99 at fye.com] I thought it might have some potential.
Can be hard to learn!
No multiplayer what so ever!
Horrible frame-rate!
The only good thing about this game is that the flying missions are kinda cool and that it is really gory!
To bad you can't change them!
Bad!!
You basicly get the same graphics from Turok: evolution!
Second, the graphics.
I was wrong!
First off, checkpoints are WAY to far spread.
Next, crappy save system.
And the only way you can save your game without losing the data you have now is to save after you cross a checkpoint.
At one point in the game, the frame-rate completely froze up, forcing me to restart the WHOLE thing from scratch.
In one level, there is only one checkpoint, and that was like halfway through the level!
Only rent!
So, what I am saying is...they're bad!

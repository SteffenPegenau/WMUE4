Which took me a year of playing.
Albion is the infiltrator, midgard is the shadowblade and hibernia is the nightshade.
But, with all games there are drawbacks.
I just recently hit 50 with one of my characters.
The concept of this game is great.
It takes an extremely long time to gain levels past 20.
Around 3-4 hours daily.
If you buy this game.
They are hard to level but they are Gods in RvR.
I really reccomend this game for hardcore gamers.
I have been playing this game for over 1 year and have only hit 50 with 1 character.
Being any other then one of those you are dead meat.
The graphics are awesome and RvR is the best idea i have seen.
There are also class balance issues as well.
By far the best i have ever played.
I suggest becoming an assasin.

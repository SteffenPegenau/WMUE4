They have that childish look to them, but are actually very mature.
i listen to the music almost everynight on my ipod.
i just love it.
The graphics are by far the best in the series, (besides X) and wow, the music!
The storyline is amaizng.
i have the whole soundtract.
And might i add, its so nice to have a game w/out guns and all that crap, final fantasy ix takes it back to a simple time, with magic and swords.
The characters are unique and just addorable.
Set in a medival setting.
You fall in love with the caracters right away.
And for it to be only 14 dollars, thats amazing.
This game makes me cry everytime.
This game is simply amazing.
It isn't to hard to beat, and levealing up is pretty simple.
it is well worth it.

Come on.
Again, stupid.I'm so glad we rented, not purchased the movie.
Everyone else died in the group he was with but he made it back to complete the family unit and call Cruise dad.
Maybe I watched the movie expecting more since Spielberg was the director.
There were several scenes that were downright stupid.
The fight between Cruise and the crazy guy (Tim Robbins) in the farmhouse.
Really stupid.
They should never have had the 15-year old son make it back to his grandmothers house in Boston (Cruise and his son had been separated mid-movie).
I have the say the special effects were outstanding but the rest of the movie was horrible.The character development was bad.
It would lend a little more credibility to being uterly alone.
He never once tries to find out what is going on else where.
When Cruise and his kids make it to the ex-wifes house after the first attack, does Cruise turn on the t.v.
or check the radio?
If they didn't work then show that.
And the end.
No.

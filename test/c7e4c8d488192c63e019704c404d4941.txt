Its almost retarted to compare Fall Out Boy to the Beatles!
ok to start this off.... im not the biggest fan of fall out boy.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!"
When will this sink in with you guys?
Punk, is NOT THE SAME AS CLASSIC ROCK!!!!!!!!
etc.
But, you people who have the time to sit in front of the computer and flame about how much they hate FOB have a problem.
ALL ROCK BANDS SHOULD DIE!!!!!!!!!
So overall, just open your ears just a little bit and stop wasting your time flaming about every little thing you whiny babys hate
"They played classical music in the 1700's.... WE SHOULD ALL LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC!!
etc.
Also, they aren't the same as Good Charlote and other crap punk bands!
etc.
So get off your lazy butts, get out of your house, and accept this...... MUSIC CHANGES!
Pretty soon im expecting to hear this from one of you.
And just so you guys know, FOB isn't emo.

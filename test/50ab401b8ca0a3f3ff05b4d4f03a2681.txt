I was a Mac user back in the fat Mac days, but had to switch to PCs for work.
Thanks for the great machine.
Its worth the extra dollars!
I was always troubleshooting my internet security and virus protection programs.
THe screen size is great and resolution is good.
The keyboard is backlite, so no problems typing in the dark.
Lots of conflicts with windows and none here.
I especially like being able to have the computer on at nite and not having to have a light on.
I especially like the fact that the operating system is so stable.
I highly recommend the MacBook Pro... for those who want the best and are willing to pay a little more for it.
I have had about 3 portables before this one, so I'm not new to portable computers.
I can't say enough about it.
After 12 years using windows, I finally came back home.
The MacBook Pro keyboard is solid to touch and the speakers sound great by themselves.
Wow, what a machine.
Like the prodigal son, I am returning with awe and wonder.

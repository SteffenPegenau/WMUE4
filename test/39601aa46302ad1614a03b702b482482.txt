Some reviewers had pouring problems.
Can be messy while getting that last drop.
Not a big deal, but more steam escapes because of this.
Overall this coffee maker is "OK" until I find a better one.
(after pre-warming pot) Pause-and-serve function spills a couple of teaspoonsfulls.
This is my second (different brand) Thermal Coffee maker.
I found matching the lid arrow to spout gives the best pouring.
Keeps coffee hot for a couple of hours.
On/off function shuts off after brewing.
It makes decent coffee.
My work-around, pull pot partly away from drip spout and catch coffee drips until it stops.
Coffee maker is attractive, but not well made.
I don't use the timer because I like to grind coffee beans at time of making coffee and not sitting in the coffee maker over night.
I've had my Mr. Coffee since Christmas '06.
I thought to wait before writing my review after using it for awhile and trying different coffee beans.
My coffee maker lid sits off center.

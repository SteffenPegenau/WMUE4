Once the toaster is unplugged,you lose all of your settings.
The toast burned also!
I gave it two more tries, and STILL get a bunt-plastic smell (though not as strong as the first time).
After years of good toast, but a broken, ugly toaster, my husband finally bought us this new toaster.
Huh????
I called the custumer service #, and after 3 tries finally got a nice lady who told me to return to to the store and get something else.
Well, this only works if the toaster remains plugged in.
!
Here's the caveat--the instruction manual tells you top unplug the toaster when not in use!!
It is boxed up and ready to go!
The first time I used it filled our home with a very strong burned plastic smell.
Anyone else experience this???
I couldn't find any plastic in the unit at all, so I figured maybe it was just because it was the first use of the toaster (although that still didn't seem right).
It has a fancy-sounding "custom control" feature.
No more cuisinart for us!!

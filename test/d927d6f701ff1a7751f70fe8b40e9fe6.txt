DONT BUY IT.
But when I pressed Power, it wouldnt turn on.
I bought my first Scooba from Linens and Things.
Its not reliable!
I was impressed with it the first time I used it.
Then a couple of weeks later, I tried it again, and it wouldnt work.
I hoped I just got a lemon.
A couple of weeks later I tried again and it wouldnt work.
I called IRobot customer support and she couldnt resolve the problem.
2 units, and neither worked after the first week.
Of course, I get stuck with the shipping costs.
Customer Service could not resolve my problem and told me to ship it back.
The next one worked great for the first time too.
!
Coincidence?
I charged the battery for over 24 hours (it should only take 16 hours max, per the manual).
Luckily, I was able to go to Linens and Things and get another one.
I dont think so.

My daughter LOVES the Baby Einstien movies but I thought I'd try these hoping maybe they were as calm and fun with the same amount of music.
I was SO disappointed with the quality of them!
Not really where I want my daughter playing.
They are $6.00.I usually only get Baby Einstein, but thought I'd try the Brainy Baby videos.
WOW.
A litte Barny-ish.Needless to say, I'm going back to Baby Einstein.
Not even close.
They will soon be coasters.
They are soooo disjointed and "messy".
They are like a wild kids party.
The music is actually a little painful to listen to.
The costume animals, one's a teddy, not too bad, the other a dinosaur with hip-hop body language.
No question about it.
1st, if you are INSISTANT that this is the video you want, go to Toys R Us.
She lost interest in the 1st two minutes anyway.

Dogs have certain kinds of dog bodies and just can't move that way.
Now that was a dog!
Well, don't waste your time with it.
Like this is a dog, Karate Dog, and Karate Dog does Karate, but he does it like a human!
As if!
I can't help comparing this movie to one of the all time great movies, Bingo.
Who wouldn't be fooled into thinking this was a great movie?
I really was expecting Karate Dog to be cool, too.
Still, it's hard for me to say the CGI dog doing karate was worse than the dog speaking English, although it was very bad.
Anyone with a dog knows that's not going to happen.
It wasn't.
Yeah, I know, Karate Dog is a really cute pooch.
They didn't need to make Bingo speak English or any other stupid things because Bingo was cool.
FML.
Dogs don't speak English and everyone knows it's because they don't have to.

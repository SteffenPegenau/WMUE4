Attack of the perfume turd5.
AB/CD is an AC/DC cover band that release their own songs to sound like AC/DC numbers.
If you are interested in this band, you may want to pass up on this album and go for "Rock N Roll Devil" instead.
Elvis, Bugs and OldiesQuite frankly the only song on here I think that is worth listening to is "Twelve Beers" AKA: She looks good after 12 beers.

Mikeys Butt3.
Not much of the songs on here stick out, in-fact I have had this album for a few years now, and can't even recall any of the songs off this album other then "Twelve Beers" and a few instrumentals that use Bengus's tap playing, which doesn't sound like Angus Young to me.

I mean, this guy is out of tune and way in front of the beat.
No clue.
Okay, the nice stuff first...this guy can definitely beat box.
This album, though, is a good lesson in learning to do what you're good at, not what you'd like to be good at.I saw him live and the same thing.
He is actually talented at that.
He wouldn't even make it through to Hollywood on American Idol.
So why doesn't he just make a beat box album?
No question there.
Take that as a sign.
So why is it he trys to sing?
Matisyahu is not a good singer.
Hey, Matis!
It'sd that simple.
That would be great.
Everyone stands around tapping there feet until the beat box song and then they all go crazy.

Especially in the bass section.
It is efficient and direct.
This is truly a masterpiece before its time.
The bass actually serves a purpose in the songs... not just a walking backdrop.
It acts as a second guitar, the way its supposed to be.
This album is a hallmark of an age.
They can't live up to this and thank God, for that.
Chad Gray, has written obviously superb lyrics, and he underscores his singing with some dramatic off center screaming.
If you listen closely enough you'll start to hear things that you never heard before either.
Every thing on this album serves a purpose.
Listen for yourself and decide.
People will look back on this album and realize that this was the first of a new generation, and that it has been vastly under apprectiated.
First of all, the Bass... Ryan Martinie is flawless...
An age of metal, that will come in about 5 to 10 years.
Don't let people fool you.

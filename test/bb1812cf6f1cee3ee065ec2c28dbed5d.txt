M'appari tutt' d'amor-4.
This is OUTRAGEOUS gouging of the consumer.
's w/Opera for Karaoke!
SHUFFLE THE CARDS AND TRY AGAIN!
Tell you what; How about putting 1.Una furtiva lagrima-2.
Nessun Dorma on one C.D.
Che gelida manina and 7.
You get ONE, count IT, ONE popular aria on each disc, so that to get 4 or 5 recognizable songs to perform for friends, you have to spend between $100.00 to $150.00 !
What I am NOT thrilled about,(and the reason for the 2 stars, because the quality of the product is fine), is that at $25.00 per C.D., the marketers COULD HAVE given a little more 'bang for the buck'!
Recondita armonia-6.
La donna e mobile-3.
Frankly, I am insulted in the marketers presumption, unless someone is interested in only one or two tracks, this set is DEFINITELY geared to GOUGE the consumer!
I am thrilled that there are C.D.
for $39.99 and let the die-hards who must have all pay for the more obscure tracks?
Vesti la Giubba-5.

I am now reading more than I have since my 20's.
The reader stays home unless I'm traveling.
Otherwise I have the reader on my phone.
I can forget that it's a Kindle until I have to turn a page.
Here's to innovation!
I had been using the Kindle app for the iPhone prior to buying my kindle.
I am usually reading several books at a time, so I like having all those options available to me.
You bet I do!
For that, I am appreciative.
I was interested in having a larger screen.
Thanks for a perfect, portable for busy readers to live life & still READ.
I do love the storage.
There is one feature I like from the iPhone app though, the ability to turn the page with my finger rather than a button.
Do I still use both of my kindles?
It is an intuitive action for most readers & allows me to get deeper into the content and forget that it's a device.
As a 40-something reader, I need larger print early in the day & the Kindle makes it easy to switch fonts.

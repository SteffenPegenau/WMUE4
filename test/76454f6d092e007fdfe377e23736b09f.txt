It's pretty good, not one of Hitch's best.
The movie was completely different.
The only way this dvd gets even three stars is because of Sabotage.
If you want to be bored and to be put to sleep, watch the movie.
Anything has to be better than that.
For anyone who adored the book, the movie is a huge disapointment.
There were no chills, no thrills, and just went on and on.
Shame on you, Hitch!
But it's better than The Lodger.
Read it on a dark stormy night.
Anyone who's thinking of buying this one, I recommend reading the book.
It was nothing like the book!
The book was chilling and suspenseful, with an ending that leaves you wanting more.
And with a happy ending!
It's a heck of a lot better.
It's fabulous if you want to be scared.
A thriller shouldn't have such a happy ending.
What's the fun in that?

I only dinged it a little for the weaknesses since I am not utilizing any of those features.
Great contrast ratio.
5 ms pixel response time.
VGA & DVI Connections.
Good brightness.
Strengths:Inexpensive.
Size does matter.
Have to go into the OSD menu to switch between inputs.Summary:I was able to get this for about $213 from Staples.com.
I watched a movie & played a game on it with no ghosting.My next purchase is a tuner card, so I can remove the 25" TV from my room.
I turned the brightness down & the contrast up.
3 yr warranty.Weaknesses:No height adjustment.
No DVI cable.
Non-powered speakers (barely audible).
So having a lower brightness than a lot of the more expensive ones didn't really matter for me.
Not only did I free up some desk space, but I will free up a corner of my room.

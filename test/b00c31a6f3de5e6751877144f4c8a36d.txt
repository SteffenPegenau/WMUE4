.
Gwyneth Paltrow was causing smoke to pour out of my TV.
And the ending leaves the door wide open for "Iron Man 2".
Good stuff.
I would have no problem with a teen of mine watching this.Fun movie.
A nice comeback by Jeff Bridges.
Be sure to watch the extra scenes (deletions/edits) on the DVD.
As Tony Stark (and Iron Man), Downey is quirky, consistent, and funny throughout.Great presentation of the Iron Man.
.
he pulled it off.
But guess what .
Super special effects.Some violence etc, but no nudity or extreme profanity.
I sat down to this one and cringed as I watched Robert Downey Jr, playing Tony Stark, start his comedy schtick (I knew that he would become "Iron Man").
And with the offbeat Downey Jr suited up inside - funny.
Powerful, yet with vulnerablities.

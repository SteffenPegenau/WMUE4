The answer to what happend to the Corlone's!
Thanks for trying Mr.
It is truly a work of art.
Many people today agree that the Godfather was the best movie and book ever done.
You cant blame him and should not beat him up for that.
He wanted to give us what we all truly want.
Author..Create somthing new..A new family, a new movie....You can do it!
I do agree with many of the comments below.
Keep it clean like the Godfather and it will SELL!!
Even Mr. Copola the great man himself knows he should have left it at Part 1 & 2.
Mr. Puzzo has passed on... and the way he left us wondering... is the way it should stay.
Only Mr. Puzzo knows the outcome and he has left it all up to us to come up with our own ending.
The person which created this new verison wanted to ride on the coat tails of somthing great.
That is why I do give this new author some credit.
!
I own the DVD and still when it is on Ch 9, I cant turn it off.

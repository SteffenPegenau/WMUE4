Because Weber put it on the side, the smoke does not even touch the food.
Instead, it snakes up the side wall and exits through the back vent.
What a waste.
First, gas grills add virtually no flavor to the food.
The flavorizer bars are no substitute for charcoal.
Do yourself a favor and get a cheaper model if baking outside is your plan.
Second, and more relevant to the Summit C, is the built in smoker.
It's a joke.
It's not worth it.
But, the time had come, or so I thought.
Yes, it works well and creates lots of smoke, but the smoke directly exits the grill housing.
Without the smoke or real grill flavor, the Summit C is nothing more than a glorified outdoor oven.
In the spirit of full disclosure, this is my first gas grill.
Think twice before you spend the $ for this grill.
If not, don't even bother.
I have used charcoal for over 20 years.

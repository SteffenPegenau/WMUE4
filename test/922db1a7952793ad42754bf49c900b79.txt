It's the only way to go .
The CDM was not good, with an extremely bitter taste.
.
The CDM dark roast with chicory was going for half as much for a 13.5 oz bag.
Well now I'm in Dallas with 29 bags of coffee I don't like.
I was in NO a few weeks ago at Zuppardos on Vets looking for New Orleans Blend Community Coffee.
I gave the remaining CDM to a local food drive.
I decided to "water it down" a bit by mixing one bag of the CDM with an equal amount of Folgers.
They had it but it was pricey at $7.00 for a 16 oz bag.
Bought 30 bags.
.
What to do?
So I thought I would save some money by loading up on CDM.
That didn't work either as the bitterness still came though.
Moral of the story: Stick with New Orleans Blend Community Coffee with chickory.

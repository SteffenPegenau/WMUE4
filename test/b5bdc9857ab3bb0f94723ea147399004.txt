King goes into a lot of reality with this book, and the mind can be the scariest monster of all.
This is the first novel of King work that I read.
You'll hear things that aren't there to be heard.
The dillusions, the voices, the ghosts, the masks.
You'll see things that aren't there to be seen.
As I got further along in the story, I felt I was inside the minds of these three characters.
When I completed this novel, I was still thinking about it for hours after.
I HIGHLY recommend this novel as a first KING read.
Not the SHINING that Danny possessed, of course, but the mental breakdown of this man, stuck in a huge hotel for months with no one but his wife and young son.
The mind is a powerful force.
What struck me as the most frightening was that somthing like this COULD happen!
I was surprised at the differences.
I had first seen the Kubrick movie and I was scared to death.
I had to read the book.
It can make you believe things that aren't real.

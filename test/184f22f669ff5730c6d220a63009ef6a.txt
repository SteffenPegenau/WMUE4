but Alissa has topped them all!
the recipes are fantastic!
definitely get it with her book and you'll be well on your way!
i wish i could give this MORE than 5 stars!
and she delivers all the necessary tools and info to do so.
Alissa has a direct, simple, and practical approach that makes it ok to start wherever you are at.
my wife and use Alissa'a recipes on a daily basis to make great and satisfying meals.
alissa has done an amazing job!!
this is not just a recipe book - although the dishes are delicious.
i own all the major raw food books available.
but it is truly a guide to how to evolve into a living foods healthy life.
too many other authors are fanatical or extremists concerning raw foods.
by the way, i also HIGHLY recommend Alissa'a DVD.
and it is easy to follow.
it has a variety of dishes that she shows you how to prepare.

What am I going to do with extra disc for?
I like watch extended HP movies on Family channel.
It is really annoying to see more and more of it in store.
That's why I won't buy this crap.
Nice to see them includes photo/label sheets and other memorabilia things.Sorry.
I don't like them to play us for profit.I am still waiting for all movies to be in one set, DVD format only and also all needed to be extended as well.
I don't have bluray.
Bluray???
Useless!!!
Yes.
I am not happy at all.
Seriously!
What I don't like about DVD, I noticed they "forced" us to buy dvd, copy and bluray combo set.
Not for my cup of tea.
Why can't they do that with dvd's???

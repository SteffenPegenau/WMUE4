Amazon need to change its description.
So I googled the "Asian Doll".And I found Yang~!

Once I saw this picture of doll, and I knew that this is The Doll For my baby.I will post the photos of my dag and yang soon after Christmas.
This is my first Christmas Gift for her.By the way, I wasn't so pleased the price was $28 when I purchased it but now dropped to $22 something.
and I also like the short hari style.
Same with my baby.oh, I almost forgot to tell you the eyes are not opening and closing.
Every doll sells in here Western looking doll.
Finally.
I am living in Korea, South.

so, we decided to wait.
when we tried her in the floor model, she had a ball!
so, i'm curious if others had as much trouble.
and, the super saver shipping took only 4 days.
my husband and i ran into toys r us w/our daughter (9 mo at the time).
anyway, my husband spent THREE hours trying to put it together.
just wish it had a seatbelt for my climber!
we saved by ordering through amazon.
this has been a great investment.
we had to get one.
now, granted he was a bit tired before he started the project.
glad we did.
in the end, he had to make some modification to get the wheels to function correctly.great to have.
we really have to watch her right now.
i would recommend it to anyone who's looking for something like this.
they only had one in stock, which was in a damaged box.

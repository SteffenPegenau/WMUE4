First when it was called WINTER'S EDGE by Anne Stuart in number 329.
She loses her memory, can't remember her husband and somebody wants to kill her.
Only the minor details changed.
I didn't hate this book like some did.
Nothing chaps my hide like reviewers who spend more time insulting other people's opinions than reviewing the book or challenging the specific points the person brought up.
I could have been bored with the story by the third time, but I don't this book was as good as those.
Then it was called THE OTHER LAURA by Sheryl Lynn in number 367.
Pretty much the same idea.
None of those here.
They were better than this one.
A woman is in a car "accident."
I only noticed cause I bought a bunch of Intriques at a book sale a couple months ago, and those were in it.
Sexy heroes.
Anyone who wants to read this story should find those books.
I didn't love it, either, probably because I read this Harlequin Intrique before.
Big surprises.
So I won't be one.
Heart-pounding romance.

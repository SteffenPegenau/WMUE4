Matt and Junior make amends restart their friendship.
Its a great four year journey.
The wedding theme went on a bit too much but Wildfire finsihes its run with pretty good stories.I was a part of the Fan Campaign to get the show renewed for another year went on after the show was cancelled.We sent bales of hay, carrots, horseshoes, letters.
Dani grows up and becomes a better, nicer person.
She still has her flare but its good to see a different side of her.
Interesting move.
There was alot of growth this year.
Wildfire is a great show that covers life in the horse racing business.
Kris is estranged from the Ritters, she has spent some time on her own.
The love of Wildfire brings her back to the scene.
The fanbase is still big.
It was worth it, we honored the show.
Its great to see this show on dvd.
Pablo stiil distrust Kris... its a good season.
Jean has turned Ritters farm into a Dude Ranch, western bed and breakfast.
I enjoyed the fourth season.

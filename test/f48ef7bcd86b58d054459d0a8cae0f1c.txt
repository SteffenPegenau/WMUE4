They looked really silly but, hey, some good hooky music.
Best thing on the album is probably the toothless DM cover.
Thumbs down on this one, sorry.
Geez, I'm getting tired of this brassy metal production of late (see In Flames' last few for the same basic problem).
This album, after two complete plays, fails to move me.
This is a good example of a band writing with too much pressure from the label and themselves.
I really wanted to like this album.
Buy Killswitch's last disc instead if you want cutting-edge "new" metal.
Metal drummers: stop riding the cymbals and play percussively.
Okay, so, yeah, the last album was pretty darn good for what is essentially light-weight goth metal.
But, man, bad production and hook-less songwriting dooms it.
They played it safe and they got safe.
Congratulations.
Just nothing grabs me, sorry.
Check out Tool if you want to hear how percussion is done right for metal.
The production: too much high-end.

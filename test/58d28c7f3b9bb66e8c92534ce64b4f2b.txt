I guess I will go back to using a bluetooth headset.
I really had high hopes for it.
I can barely hear through the speaker.
It has only worked a couple of times when I first got it - where I could actually hear the other person through the speaker.
I have a 2004 Explorer that is pretty quite on the road.
People on the other end can't hear me at all.
I also use a Motorola Q.
I don't drive a noisy car either.
I also tried to pair the device with my wife's phone, a Motorola V710.
It is supposed to work fine with that phone.
Same thing, it pairs up, but I can't hear anything through the speaker.
Please don't waste your money on this garbage.
Since then, it has never worked.
So, I was dumb enough to throw the box away at that point.
Bought this product about 2 months ago.
I have tried uninstalling the device and reinstalling...nothing works.

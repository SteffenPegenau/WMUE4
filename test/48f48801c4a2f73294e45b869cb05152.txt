I order a fair number of DVDs from Amazon, but this one never came.
Anyway.
I rented it and have in my Blockbuster library.
LOL.
I blame myself for not noting that I never received this DVD.
I will contact the seller and see if we can trace the package.
I'm sure it will be straightened out.
So, searched my library of DVDs, which IS visible and somewhat organized.
Liked it so much, I guess I bought the DVD.
Just one of those glitches.
Didn't realize I had bought it till I got the e-mail asking me to give a review on my purchase, and I'm like, "Hey, I didn't remember buying that one and I don't have it now???"
Stuff happens now and then.
First time I have not gotten a delivery, so I'm not posting this as a negative.
Or I forgot I had it online.
Not a negative on the seller.
Go figure.
No movie.

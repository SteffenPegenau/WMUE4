i know u only get 3 disks, but to really beat it you have to buy the fourth one.
i remembered i cried all xmas day and like for 3 weeks afterwards.
i remember when i got this game in my x-mas stocking last year.
basically in the fourth disk, you have to try to chop a mog into the shape of a catterpillar.
i was good all year and santa gave me this lame game.
cloud, the main hero, has a sword that looks like a pencil, even has an eraser on it tooo, how lame!!!
i wish santa would have given me a big lump of coal instead.
i felt so bad.
i wrote to santa this year and he promised me not to give me and final fantasy 7 stuff this year, and i was happy.
:(
alot of people hate this game cuz to beat it you have to pay[...] to get the code to unlock the 4th disk.
the grafix looks really bad, sorta like big slices of oranges with eyes.
my dad bought it for me and it sucked.
how could santa give me such a bad game????
final fantasy 7 is the worst game ever made.

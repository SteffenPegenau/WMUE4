Heck, this one might be going back yet tonight.
And I have to give it that--it has a great display and great sound.
Yes froze, just like a Windows computer.
I couldn't stop it or anything.
It supports surround sound and DBBS.
You can't listen to quiet music--there is no volume setting between "mute" and "too loud."
It take about 90 second to read a disc.
It can also recharge batteries.
The hiss while jogging is pretty bad, and there isn't even a belt clip!After opening the box, it cut off at the end of the first song I played.
I bought this unit because of its cool display.
I had to remove the batteries to reset it.I've been listening to it play three songs as I wrote this review, and it cut off before the end of all of them.
I opened the cover, removed the CD, and it still kept spinning.
As it started to play the next song, it froze.
This is going back tomorrow.
The problem is that everything else is pure garbage.

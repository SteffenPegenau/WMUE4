As a graphics pad it works.
Didjaknow that Al Hirschfeld used the big pad to do his great cartoons?
So after a three week wait by the supplier, it came.
It says uninstall previous software.
So I dropped the stylus from my smaller Wacom Usb pad in my foot bath.
It ceased working.
So I googled around to find a fix which (...) convinced me it wasn't just because I was a bad girl.
O ho Thought I, a way to play around with an Ink like software without buying a TabletPc.
Well The software doesn't install.
Instead of getting just the new pen I decided to get the bigger pad, pen included.
I looked at the pretty pictures on the box.
So I have the big pad.
I did, again and again.
My previous stylus had its bad hair days with the pressure sensitive effect.
That's the breaks.
And oops I didnt try it with my Photoshop before writing this.
So my review is like the little girl with the curl in the middle of her forhead, when it s good it is very very good, and when it is bad it is horrid.

Rob's abilities, talent and range are genius.
Like no other I've ever heard.
Kicking some butt daily!
His voice, one of a kind.
Tonya
I only wish I had known about them (2003-ish) before now.
Rob stands out due to nothing more than his pure raw talent.
Rob Grad now, today in 2011, has a solo career and new projects under way.
This man hits high notes that reach out beyond the universe.
Easily said: Rob Grad and Superfine were at the top of their game with this CD back in early 2000's!
I'm certainly enjoying this Superfine CD and anything else where Rob Grad is the main vocalist!
But at least I do know now and love the CD.
So stay on the lookout for him and his next new projects!
I Zumba to it everyday!
Thanks Robbie!
I hope Amazon.com gets more of these CD's, so you too can hear for yourself!
Although I know they are no longer together today, at least I have a piece of their history.

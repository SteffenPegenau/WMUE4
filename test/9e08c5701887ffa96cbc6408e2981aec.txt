They spent to much time on certain parts of the movie.
I expected it to be much better.
Definitely read the books first.
The special effects were the best part.
Eragon and Roran looked too much alike!
The 103 minutes they used were NOT WELL USED.
It was a really bad movie.
The characters were nothing like they described in the book.
I read the books, and they were really good.
The movie completely destroyed the story.
They also revealed things too early and changed the entire story.
My friend was reading the book, but after watching the movie she didn't want to keep reading because she was afraid the book would be too much like the movie.
The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because of the special effects.
They didn't explain many things that were explained in the book, making it confusing for people who haven't read the book.
Saphira and the Shade were definitely the best characters.
!
IT'S NOT!!!!!!
They left out lots of important parts of the book out.

effected play.
but not the one hooked up to tv.
so im watching it for the first time.
no scratches on them.
it plays on my computer.
i looked at the back of the disc.
for that kind of money they should.
so i checked all disc.
star trek, as a kid i never like it or watched it as my parents did.
who ever packed them was'nt carefull in putting them in the case.
disc two skipped.
so i would advise people to check disc.
now im grown up and like it.
but i guess not deep enough.
i got the first season off e-bay (sealed) brand new.
2 scratches.

Gotta Catch 'em All!
Think of the Pokemon that have been hurt by these things.
A real gamer / Pokemon Trainer would know better than to buy CHEATING DEVICES!
(without cheating)
Just close it.
Don't buy this.
Now I want you to take that mouse or track pad of yours and close out this product detail window.
If you want an advantage on your games, buy an official strategy guide from Nintendo Power or Prima.
Now.
Don't even THINK about buying this.
We can stop this!
Don't deny it, you know it's true.
Or a Pokemon Trainer?
Anything with a Nintendo Seal is fine.
It's the right thing to do.
I'm disgusted with you.
You call yourself a gamer?
Be a good person.
So do it.

And I followed the directions VERY carefully!!
Ugh I'm SO disappointed!!
These things suck.
I tried everything.
I tried all kinds of tricks to get these things to work.
I got them at Walgreens for $8.
I warmed them up with my hair dryer for a few seconds instead of my hands to make sure that the wax was warm and that did nothing.
Total rip off.
No matter how concisely I followed the directions I got very poor results.
This product is terrible!!
I let my hair grow to a proper length for waxing and then I read the directions VERY carefully.
I was so excited at the thought of not having to shave, so I read lots of positive reviews and then went out and bought some for myself.
They hardly removed any hair and left wax behind.
So I had to wipe the spots I waxed with those wipes and now my calves look like they have razorburn!
DO NOT waste your money!!

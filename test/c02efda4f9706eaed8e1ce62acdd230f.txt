I wonder if "JackAss" would have the nerve to do a stunt like that!'''''
Akira is just an aquired taist.
And this thing is but an inch away from the persons face.
Anyway, as for the movie.
It has an intrieging plot.
But thats why I call "Akira" an anamated hoorrer movie.
Akira is actualy a really well anamated movie evin for todays standards.
That part was definitly cool but, it does leave me with a bit of a jauring fealing afterwards.
Theres nothing rong with the movie, whats in Akira is all good to watch.
You can only see this anamated.
Imagen watching someone in the rottin sewers of Japan.
Plot twists.
The bike sceens with the clown gang realy get me pumped.
I realy liked the movie half way up intel the antagonist mutated into a demented/gutsy grotesc jiant.
With almost thier whole body in the water, but only thier eyes to see above the serface and a dead rat carcasis risses up on the serface; with magets oozing out of it.

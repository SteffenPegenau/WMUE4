You had a classic.If you've never used this head's precurser, then you might like this head simply because you don't know how much of a step backwards it took.
Everybody hates it.
We have several 3030 heads but since they were discontinued, I purchased this one.
I'm really upset with Bogen/Manfrotto.
We won't buy anymore.
It's similar to when Ford went from the '64 1/2 - '66 Mustang to the '67.
In fact, I'm using eBay to buy the old 3030.
The quick release has gone backwards in engineering.
It's the red-headed stepchild tripod of our studio and is constantly being shunned.
Bogen, bring it back!
Why???
I had to buy a new tripod for our studio.
Obviously, they did not ask photographers before making the switch.
The handles are extremely diminuitive.
They discontinued my personal favorite head, the 3030, and replaced it with this one.
Simply put, it's clunky and seems to be very convoluted.

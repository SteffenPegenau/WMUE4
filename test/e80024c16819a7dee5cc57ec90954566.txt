I do not have springs with mine so I e-mailed them to see if the new blades would work on mine.
They don't have the best customer service.
I stop because I need to order new blades.
I e-mailed back told them mine is 18 yrs old and he might not have been with the company that long.
I use it on and off for 3-4 years at a time.
I got my Flowbee in 1994.
It took them several days to answer yes.
I emailed back to see if I could get my money back if the blades do not fit.
After several days I was told to throw away the springs.
Again after several days they said all the units have springs.
It says the blades come with 4 springs also.
I looked up on line to see about ordering new blades.
I e-mailed them back to make sure since because I did not have springs with mine.
I never did and I would start using it again.
It has been 3 weeks and I have not heard from them.

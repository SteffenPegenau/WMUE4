These song's must be the leftovers.
There is actually nothing new as far as content is concerned.
What was jay-z thinking?
Back to the drawing board Jay...
Well, all good things come to an end.
For starters this album is horrible!
Not to mention the recycled material.
The whole feel of the album is been there done that.
The vast majority of the material sounds a bit rushed and even a little desperate.
The opposite is what made the orignal BP so bomb.
The song features B.I.G.
25 song's on the album, when in reality he should have used the better 11 for an Lp or the top 5 worth listening to for a CD sampler.
Same ole, same...can we hear something a little deeper than how much money you have?
It uses a verse from juicy.
Not to mention how he butchers 2-pac's beat from "Me & My Girlfiend" and tried to spice it up with a not needed spanish guitar...Lets not forget how 2pac HATED Jay-Z why would you want to sample a beat from a legend who coulnd't stand you?

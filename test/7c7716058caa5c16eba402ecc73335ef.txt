Just grow and don't be afraid to try something new!
Almost every song on Human Clay can be compared to a My own Prison song.
NOW, I don't mind that.
(Whats this life for=With arms wide open) Keep up the good songs Creed!
I think its a great album, great songs.
Whisper, scream, but don't stay so monotone throughout the album.
For the third album CHANGE CHANGE CHANGE!
Like Stone Temple Pilots did with "songs of the vatican" which erased them of there "They sound like Pearl Jam" reputation.
Rock On!
Human Clay, probably did so well because Creed, instead of going into new ground, played it safe and gave the fans more of what they love.
Scott also needs to experiment with his voice, try different tons and moods.
Scott has a powerful voice, and the band knows how to please its fans.
Inspiring Lyrics.
If these guys wanna last, they need to experiment and find there own sound.
But PLEASE!!!

It was just that it was hard to hear Shakira.
I also love Latin singers.
Her voice seemed to blend in with the music in a way that it was difficult to hear what she was singing.
However I love concert videos and have a large collection spanning several genres.
If anyone has a suggestion of another disc of hers that I can watch where her voice is more distinct I would like to give it a try.
The music was crystal clear.
I have a brand new higher end home theater system.
I watched the blu Ray disc last night.
Don't get me wrong.
I am also 58 so this may be a generational thing.
I tried the various sound stages on my pioneer receiver however no luck.
In addition I am an avid concert goer.
I so much wanted to and was expecting to enjoy this one.
I am not a fan of Shakira in fact I have never heard or seen her work.
I stopped watching the disc because I was disappointed.
My main disappointment was with the audio recording of this disc.

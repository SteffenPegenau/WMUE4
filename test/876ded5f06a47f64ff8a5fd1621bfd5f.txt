We could talk wenever we wanted.

And with the lef over money we bought a paif of really good walkie talkies with a 50 mile range.
We had spent hours in front of hasbro.com lokking at the features of it.
What a disapointment!
DONT BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THE TOY IS A PIECE OF JUNK DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK.

Please take my advice.
My friend and i let my mom sell them on ebay.
(...)my best friend and i split the cost and bought this toy with our christmas.
We thought it would be great.
Wen we finally got them we opened them with anticipation.

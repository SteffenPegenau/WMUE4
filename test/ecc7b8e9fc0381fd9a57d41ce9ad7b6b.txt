They hit like a big truck two years with their first album.
"Messin' Around" even seems like a song from the first album.
The Datsuns can deliver onstage.
The only problem is The Darkness.
The album loses focus halfway through and you are left scratching your head.
I saw them play live two years ago and couldn't believe it.
Even with John Paul Jones on board, they would have pull off a miracle to better themselves.
The Darkness seemed to come in last year and steal the thunder.
Maybe live these songs are a hell of a lot better.
They spent a lot of time on the road and maybe didn't have enough time to revolt against generic sounds.
This is the second album from the New Zealand band.
They have a lot of talent and conviction bringing back exciting rock.
While the album is pretty rocking it seems like they rushed it.
With songs like "Blacken My Thumb" and "Messin' Around" you would think they have answered the tall order.
The first Datsuns album was near perfect.

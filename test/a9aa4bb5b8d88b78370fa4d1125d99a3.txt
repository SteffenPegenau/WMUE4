(well, it's on the CD, but doesn't list it on the back for some reason)----7.
Good service, not what I was expecting on the CD though.Tracks:--1.
There are 9 tracks on this CD, and none of them had the remix I was looking for.
This sure didn't have it.
Sounded a lot different.
Dub 11:35----5.
12" Mix Show Edit 4:50----6.
Tony Moran's "2002 Anthem Mix" 11:36----2.
Tribal Mix 8:35----4.
I have the Wild Workout at Noon Vol.1 CD, and it has Don't Break My Heart on it, but I wanted a version that didn't have the Wild Workout title said over the beginning and end of the song.
I bought from Doolicity and they sure shipped it out quick.
I guess that's what you get with a blind buy.
Kenny Diaz "Booty Shaker Mix" 4:10----3.
Tribal Instrumental 8:38----9.
7" Radio Edit 3:55----8.
Love In On Her Mind "Transatlantic Mix" 6:00--

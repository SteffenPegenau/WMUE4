not something you can worry about on a battlefield.
i will hand it to the makers that they made a gun with one hell of a racket.
3 out of 5. kudos to you blue elephant.
this is a really good gun.
since the design is that of a bullpup, the accuracy is fairly reasonable.
every other bb will fire nicely.
if you use semi auto then you arent.
you have to shoot one int the chamber then fire the next one immediately to propel the first out of the gun.
if you get this gun you need the hi cap mag with it.
it's like the bb's tailgate eachother.
if you use full auto then you're set.
the only problem with it is the disability to load the bb's.
you need to be able to fire in bursts.
granted it will come out twice as fast but still it's a hassle.
this gun pull it off well.
this gun unloads extremely fast.
carbine sized gun but with sniper like accuracy is the bullpup design.

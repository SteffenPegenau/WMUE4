When I unplugged it and tried to turn it on, the device was dead.
I've tried many variations on that routine, all with the same result.
Connectivity.
Memory.
The USB hookup is extremely unreliable.
They address none of the issues the device's defects have raised.That's about it.
Here are the features that did not work right out of the box:1.
Power.
I can get it to hold for only a few seconds at a time.
The device would recognize none of them.4.
I found no answers.
It is impossible to synchronize it with either the desk top computer or with an on-line source such as Audible.com.3.
I tried 16MB, 64MB, 128MB.
It will not accept a charge.
It's certainly not portable in this condition.2.
It will work only while plugged into a wall socket.I've searched the documenation, thinking maybe there's another part needed.
Documentation.
It's very shiny.
I left it plugged in, turned off, for 72 hours and the little amber light blinked all the while.
The help files on the CD are useless.

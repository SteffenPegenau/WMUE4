Buy this you'll like it & you won't give it away!
It fits in most backpacks and it's a good scan for what you need.
And if hidden properly, people won't 'borrow' it & forget to give it back.
I bought 3 of these because they are light weight, easy to pack, and scan quite well for class/office/on-the-fly!I plan on using my new one with my laptop for class.
LOL!
I put this on my Gift List of things I don't have to think about.
Because it stores between books & things in an upright position if necessary.
!Definitely makes a good gift & the price is right.
Fits easily in a 10x13 padded envelope or bigger.
This way, I don't have to hunt one down at work/school to use.
Hide it, you say?
Yes!
I can just buy it & know it won't end up regifted, in the trash, or the Salvation Army bin!
I can easily store it & hide it so you don't even know it's there.
This way it will be overlooked and safe from prying hands & busy minds!!
!It's a keeper!

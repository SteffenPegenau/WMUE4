I'll talk about the sound quality first.
There is realy only a couple of hits, 2 top 40 thats it.
So rich and full sounding you won't believe your ears.
Lots of fillers.
Now the content, The little yellow sticker states All of Roys biggest hits, Thats would not be my opinion.
It's worth the price for the songs that are on here they, Sony has really raised the bar.
Clear as a bell no tape hiss you really need to listen to this.
But to be fair That sound quality is great.
How they managed to get this quality I'll never know.
I can not believe how this sounds.
All the Monument is on the first CD and there is alot missing.
Hopefully someone will fill in the missing songs with as good a sound quality in the future.
It is just fantastic.
Not quite all of his biggest hits, Not Close, Running Scared a #1 hit is not here, In Dreams a #2 hit not here, Mean Woman Blues a # 5 hit not here.. All his newer stuff is on the second disc.
What it lacks in content it makes up in sound quality.

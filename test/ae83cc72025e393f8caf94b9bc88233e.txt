Where do I start?
Avoid at all cost.
I own almost every CD that bears the FF name, and I can tell you that this is BY FAR the worst.
FF fans- stay away!!
All electronic, and poor quality electronic, too.
A couple tracks are tolerable at best (my reason for giving this 2 Stars instead of 1), but the rest...God, I'm so upset I can't even see straight!
Besides different electric instruments, the music is exatcly the same.
The real stuff is MUCH better.
Liberi Fatali, one of the best pieces of FF ever, has been destroyed and tainted by this disgrace of a CD.
My GOD.
This is all synthiesized.
Um...let's see....DON'T BUY THIS EVER!
Completely disreguard any review that calls this CD orchestrated.
FF Music newcomers- do not take this music as a true representation of FF music.
Even if the sound quality on this CD came REMOTELY close to sounding good, the music has no variation to the music in the games.

When the movie premiered on t.v., I was only able to tape the second half.
I loved it and have watched this half over and over again.
The scene where Otis and his son visit Paul at his home to see how he was doing.
The scene where Eddie visits David at his condo (where David offers Eddie his opinion among other things).
I bought the video thinking I would be seeing the whole movie.
You will not be disappointed.
I blew my stack to see that scenes were cut out.
version.
I watched it again to make sure I wasn't seeing things.
And the scene where David visits Eddie performing at a night club and they both sing "You're my Everything" (I love that scene).Worth every penny?
I would love a copy of the full t.v.
Yes.

The scene where Paul was singing at the party.
Don't get me wrong, this movie even edited is still EXCELLENT.Here are just some of the scenes cut from the video: The scene where David and Tammy are at the picnic.

I mean, really, really, bad.This is a nostalgia purchase, nothing more.
Ultima games only became worth purchasing beginning with Ultima 7.
They're bad.
Yeah, maybe.
This is where the Baldur's Gate Series began, which eventually spawned the Elder Scroll Games, so there is an historical component.
It's pretty simple, here.
So you want three games if want old-school Ultima: Ultima 7, Ultima 7 Serpents Isle, and Ultima 8.
Is anybody really buying this?
The rest of the titles are just garbage, and that they want to charge a fortune for them now is just laughable.
And will your PC even play the older titles?
I might pay ten bucks or so to play these titles again (maybe).
Still, it's just not worth this price.
It is to witness the evolution of RPG gaming, but definitely not to empty your bank account doing it.Ultima 7 and Ultima 7 Serpents Isle are still great fun to play; Ultima 8?
A little less so, mostly because it is smaller in scope.
And would you even want it to?

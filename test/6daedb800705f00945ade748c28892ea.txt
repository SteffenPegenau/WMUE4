Just take it back.It will not pick up pet hair, and leaves "streaks" along carpeted areas.
It won't pick up anything on hardwood flooring, and the only side that will get anything near a baseboard is the right side.
And the smell?
The vacuum clogs constantly.
The left side?
Spend a little more and get a good vacuum.Shame on you, Eureka!
Don't unbox it or set it up.
NOW.
I truly wish I hadn't wasted my money on this vacuum.First off, if you have pets -- take it back to the store.
Hideous.
I'm not kidding.
I've checked everything, but this vacuum stinks.Please, PLEASE, don't waste your money on this.
I'm not sure ... it's like the brush isn't even reaching there.The collection container is hiddeously small.
Constantly.
I don't know why.
Keep a phillips screwdriver with you at all times.

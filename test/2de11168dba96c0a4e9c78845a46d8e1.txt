Although, interestingly enough, the image would preview on the screen, but wouldn't record.
But it would not capture analog video (though either S-video or composite input).
Shame.
Same result.
I returned the card and got a new one.
Return it").
Software would shut down or give me an error message whenever I hit record.
Although digital capture worked fine, 75% of my material was analog, so I ended up returning this one, too.
I tried uninstalling/re-installing, shutting off virus protection, etc.
A couple of emails to tech support were of no help ("probably defective card.
I was hoping for some kind of suggestion, or a patch or any help.
Digital capture went without a hitch.
Installation went fine.
It was under $100 and could capture both digital and analog video.
I had high hopes for this capture card.
This time, emails to tech support weren't answered.

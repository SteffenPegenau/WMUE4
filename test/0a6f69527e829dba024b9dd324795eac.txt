However, I know such abuse is a part of some women' lives.
However, the fact that I did not care that much for the main characters did not distract from the great story generally.I googled Ms. Vaughn and I can't find her anywhere.
I wasn't that fond of Lauren either.
His abuse of her was all emotional from neglect.
The reasons are the reason I rarely read romance novels unless they are written by someone who has eliminated some of the ridiculous adjectives that add a level of cheesiness.I disliked Roget very much.
We learn about the Placee system and Creole society and their attitudes.
He was such a wimp to me.
He did not do justice to Lauren until late.
I was already aware of this because I am a history buff.
I liked this book very much.
I did not give it five stars because I had a few problems with the writing and story telling.
The history lesson is wonderful.
This book needs to be re-issued.
It was a great read.
I highly recommend.
The emotional abuse was hard for me.

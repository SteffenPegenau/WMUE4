I didn't like that each model was specifically for a trimester.
All in all, it's a good pregnancy workout.
Many of us can still do most of the postures with no or small modifications.
When I finish, I always feel refreshed and energized.
I wish it took more of a "do what feels right" approach.
The modifications here are completely appropriate to enhance circulation for each trimester.
I had no trouble following the video and getting back into it.
The tape assumes in trimester 3, all you can do is sit in a chair and put your arm or leg out.
It's great for anyone who wants to continue yoga practice through pregnancy.
The stretches are good and very appropriate for pregnancy.
The relaxation at the end is fantastic.
I'm just picking up again in the third trimester.
Before becoming pregnant, I attained a fairly advanced level.
I really enjoyed this video.
I stopped practicing around 9 wks because of "all day sickness".
I liked the 3 different models showing different modifications.

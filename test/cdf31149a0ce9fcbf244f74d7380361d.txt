First off, it's written I believe by a British writer.
Maybe that is a classic style, but found it a very boring style.
So alot of British phrases are used which slowed up the read for me a little.
The cover of the paperback and the reviews suck you in.
Had a few horrific descriptions which were funny at best.
Didn't find the flow of the book to be very interesting.
Totally in the 1st person.
Not good at all.
But just found it to be alot of hype.
3rd, he will say something in one paragraph and then the same thing in another paragraph just worded different.
2nd, it's written like a diary.
Bought off internet store, so didn't have high expectations.
The ending, to me, went nowhere.
One review on the cover said 'For lovers of the macabre'.
Not my type of horror book.

So I did I have now read every one except for her latest McGrady book.
The first book I ever read was #3.
All of the series!
Patricia Rushford writes beautifully.
Along with the Helen Bradley also.
I have been reading the Jennie McGrady series since I was 12.
Along with writing books.
So please read her facinating books.
I know that I will also enjoy this one as well.
I found that she is a lot like her characters.
I only wish I had her talent.
She visited me and my family to come talk to my school about being an author.
I find both series very interesting.
She is a wonderful bubbly person who has an excentric personality and energy to do anything.
Not too long ago I got to meet her personally.
It was addicting.
I had to start from the beginning.

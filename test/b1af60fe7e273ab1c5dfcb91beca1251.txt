I couldn't believe how badass it was.
Vicious album.
It gave me goosebumps.
I initially picked it up bcuz of the cover.
But if you like hardcore music, go pay the money and buy this record.
Mat Bruso brings the heat with the whole album.
I saw they were on Victory Records and listened to it while I was there.
It is a diamond in the rough.
I turned countless friends onto this album.
I hate downloading, so support the bands and spend the money.
(The record label means everything to me on my choices on what to buy.)
Lol.
I was just in my local album shop when this album dropped and they had a bunch of copies for like $7 bucks bcuz they were irregular and had a hole punched on the bar code.
I accidentally found it and was hooked.
Badass.
Try their latest "Mosh n Roll" too.
I couldn't take this album out for like 6 months.

It's so very hard to find information on the subject matter these days.
People tend to forget our past especially our Anglo-European history.
Very Enthralling indeed.
Such is life, such is beauty, and such is the world.
I simply love reading about what the world has become today.
For being so informative and rare I give this item 5 stars.
Like a plague it jumps from petal to petal destroying our very way of life.
A mix of history that only vindicates my sensual desires.
Please join me, join the logical and strong side.....the side of vigor and power.
A plethora of madness and desire.
Then we can watch the world destroy itself with "causality abound".
Quite satisfying for such a archaic document.
It would do us all good to not be ignorant of such things.
The jester is not just a character, but a symbol of madness and desire.
Weakness is what plagues the withering rose we call the United States today.
It was quite permissive and residually pleasing.

Same beautiful cinematography.
Nicolas Cage is no Dinero but then again he is Cage and that works for me.
Impossible not to compare it to Taxi Driver and it stands up to it.
I really hope you saw Bringing Out the Dead while it was in the theatre.
I may have to get the soundtrack.
I just saw it and thought it was most excellent.
New York city night street scenes.
I am buying BOTD on DVD and putting it on the shelf with Casablanca and Mars Attacks.
Truely a Martin Scorsee film.
A bit of a sacred cow perhaps.
The music worked well too.
Some of the dialogue is brilliant and obviously taken straight from the book.
I recently saw Taxidriver again and don't think it ages well.
He plays disturbed/deranged SO well.
I have to read it now.
The Janis scene is a hoot.
Lot of nice blues but some rockers too, the tunes fit the scenes well.

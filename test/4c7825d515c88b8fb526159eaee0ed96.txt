FORGET AUTOCONFIGURE.
THIS PRODUCT SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK FOR THE LAYMAN.
THIS PRODUCT IS THE WORST PIECE OF JUNK I HAVE EVER TRIED TO INSTALL.
I HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH NETGEAR PRODUCTS AND HAVE NEVER HAD THESE KINDS OF OUT OF BOX FAILURES.
I AM COMPUTER LITERATE.
THEN I TRIED TO USE THE INSTALLATION CD.
FIRST, I AM TECHNICALLYSAVVY AND UNDERSTAND IP ADDRESSES SUBMASK AND PROPEGATION THEORIES.
IT TOOK OUT MY ROUTER AND ISP.
IT DOES NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX.
TOOK ME OVER 1 HOUR TO RESTABLISH MODEM/ISP CONNECTION.
BIG MISTAKE.
THE CD FROZE AND CRASHED MY SONY VAIO FS660W BRAND NEW LAPTOP.
AND I DO HAVE THE VERSION 2.
I INSTALL SYSTEMS FOR A LIVING.
SAVE YOURSELF MANY PROBLEMS AND STAY AWAY FROM THIS HARDWARE.
TRIED IT BOTH IN WIRELESS AND ETHERNET CONNECTED.IT SIMPLY DID NOT AUTOCONFIGURE.

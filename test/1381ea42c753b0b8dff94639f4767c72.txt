I don't print much and everytime I use it there's an issue.
If you like to fax stuff don't bother with this one.
Faxing?
As previous poster said it has issuses.
I just defaults and doesn't do a thing till you get a new one.
Now I'm back researching.This printer has issues with ink.
Ink is WAY to expensive and if you even try to recieve a fax or print a B&W; document and a color cartridge is low, forget about printing anything.
The search continues...
I hate buy new printers because there expensive and you don't know what your going to get.
Why can't any printer company sell a bullet proof printer?
I researched before I bought and wound up with this.
Thought for sure it would break but, it keeps going.
Can't even trick it into thinking theres a new one in there.
After about 6 months it's been making this god awful noise with gears grinding.
It was highly recommended.
I've had this printer for about 3 years now.

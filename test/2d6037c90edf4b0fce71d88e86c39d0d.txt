I WAS EXPECTING MORE SMOOTH OUT GRAPHICS, BUT WHAT THE DREAMCAST IS GIVEN..I'LL TAKE.
WHEN I FINALLY OPENED THE PACKAGE AND POPPED THE DISK IN MY DREAMCAST I WAS ON A RIDE TO SAVE THE WORLD.
IT'S BASICALLY LIKE THE PC VERSION MAYBE ENHANCED JUST A LITTLE BUT WORKS GREAT.
YOU'LL ENJOY IT.
I WAS EXCITED TO KNOW THAT RAINBOW SIX WAS COMING OUT ON THE DREAMCAST.
FUN!.
IT'S JUST LIKE THE PC VERSION BUT WITH EASIER CONTROL..INSTEAD OF USING A KEYBOARD , NOW YOU CAN USE A JOYSTICK.
CHECK IT OUT ON THE DREAMCAST.
RAINBOW SIX ON THE DREAMCAST IS AWESOME.
IT'S FUN!
I LOVE THE GRAPHICS AND REALISM IN RAINBOW SIX.
IT'S AN AWESOME GAME YOU JUST CAN'T PUT DOWN.
FUN!
SO IF YOU'RE A RAINBOW SIX JUNKIE.
IF YOU PLAYED THE PC VERSION AND LOVED IT..WELL GET READY TO PURCHASE THE DREAMCAST VERSION.

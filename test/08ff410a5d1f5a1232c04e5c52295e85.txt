I love mysteries and this is one of the best mysteries I have ever read.
Now Joan believes that her brother is still alive.
But she cannot ell anyone.
Somehow I always found myself getting lost in the book.
But they find Joan finds out that her brother has been doing some bad things.
Lois Duncan did a great job hooking a person into the book.
It is about two kids (Dan and Larry) that get lost in the mountains.
But Larry's sister Joan gets a call from a guy that says that Larry owes him money.
It had a great twist to it.
Everyone thinks they are dead.
But I would definitely choose to read this book instead of watching TV.
I could not put the book down.
The book, They Never Came Home was a great book.
If you want to read a great book They Never Came Home is the book for you.
Now it is all up to Joan and Dan's brother Frank to pay back the money and to find their brothers.
I am not that big of a reader and I rather watch TV.

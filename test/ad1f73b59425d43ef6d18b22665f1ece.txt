Little 13 year old JoJo!"
and I said,"JoJo, no doubt!
The other day one of my friends asked me, "Who is better: Joss Stone or JoJo?"
HOWEVER, JoJo is boring.
I had no idea who the heck she was talking about until today.
Like I said before, she can sing but this CD gets boring because it's nothing that you haven't heard before lately on FM radio.
Now that I know who JoJo is, I can say that JoJo is better than Joss Stone.
It's just aight.
Do you know when Jodeci is going to get back together?"
JoJo's remake of SWV's "Weak" was alright, but it wasn't necessary.
I mean, the girl can sing but she needs to do 3 things: 1) Stop the screetching 2) Stop trying to grow up so fast and 3) Find a style of her own.
Anyone can sing those songs.
and my friend responded,"No, yo!
Other than that, this CD isn't worth writing home about.
The few tracks that I like are "The Happy Song" and "Keep on Keepin' On."
Not that JoJo!

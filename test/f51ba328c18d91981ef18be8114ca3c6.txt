No strange worlds or aliens.
It is not a ray gun, ships blowing up film.
But then when it was made it was quite forward thinking.I would say a great rental movie.
Just humans and three robots.
I would have like to seen more development between the characters.
Unless you like to collect old sci fi movies.
The forest domes appear too small, to limited by what should have been there.
I bought it for what I remembered and to share it with my kids.
Many would find it boring today.
It was of those movies I remember from my childhood.
I recommend it for the true hard core sci fi fans.
The effects are great.The acting is B rated.
Those who like films with ecology messages.
Story could have used a little more development.
By today's standards, the technology and ship look dated.
As it was you understood the main characters reasons, but it was hard to feel for him.The robots were very unique in design.
The characters were a bit one dimensional.

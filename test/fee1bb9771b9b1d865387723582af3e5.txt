and what's with the production?
el-p stule of beats really don't go well with aesop rock.
there is no real message and sometimes gets a little long-winded.
but- this sucked.
HE HAS A UNIQUE VOICE AND FLOW.
i'm sorry- there's no excuse- he has connections- use them!
the production made this cd a waste of money.
anyways- aesop needs fakts-one, or blockhead.
el-p should stick with cannibal ox- that's a perfect combo!
sorry.check out his older stuff- they're great!
i still think he is a great lyricist.
boring.
I AM A HUGE FAN OF AESOP ROCK.
but- since this rating is of this release- which includes raps/lyrics & beats- it gets a low rating.
has a flow that can go very slow then go at the speed of light.

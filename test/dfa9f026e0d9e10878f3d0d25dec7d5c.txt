It sat on my to be read pile for a long time before I gave it a chance.
Thank goodness I did.
The chemistry between the characters was great.
There was some of that but it was still interesting.
There was a definite story besides the hero and heroine.
I loved this book.
I only have 5 keepers and this is one of them.
I hate it when every second page is the characters denying that they want the other.
It had me hooked from the first chapter.
Sadly, I'm guilty of judging a book by its cover and this cover was very bad.
I actually read it a little slower than most because I didn't really want it to end.
Usually villains are one dimensional and I've often skimmed over them because they are so stale.
This book was such a surprise.
There was just enough lust and not too much.
He was so well developed that you actually hated him.
The villain was awesome.

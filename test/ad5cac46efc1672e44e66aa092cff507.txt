This is an album of pop songs.
I'm a fan of Sarah.
I will say, however, that her re-make of "What a Wonderful World" was a bit out of place.
But I don't like the two together.
Too airy, too soft.
She doesn't have the voice for it.
I like her a lot, but I don't like when she sings pop songs.
You'll be mad if you do.
It's not that I feel Sarah should only stick to the music she usually sings, that classical/opera type music.
It's like Britney Spears, it's not her songs that are bad, it's her voice.
That was a bad song and a bad voice.If you're thinking about buying this cd, don't.
Doesn't fit.
She's just not a pop singer.
Same thing applies to this album, it's not Sarah's songs, it's her voice.
But I do think she should stick to music she can actually sing.
I like Sarah.
Not good.I like pop music.

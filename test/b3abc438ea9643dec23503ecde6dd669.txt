Well done Hiromi!
She is a breath of fresh air.
I quite by accident checked this out from my local library.
Where have you been all my life?
Fantastic recording!
Best recording of 2007.
After one play I immediately sought out the SACD for purchase and I will never part with it.
Hiromi is hot and on fire, her mind complex and her hands are all over the keyboard.
Play it; learn it and you can't help but love it.
All the other musicians on this are at the top of their game as well.
Please purchase this recording immediately.
Also, there is a live concert DVD of these musicians performing these songs that must be experienced.
It takes classic fusion and moves it foreward a generation or two.
No wonder everyone wants her to be on their recordings.
Brilliantly conceived and expertly executed!
I was not familiar with this artist or her music.
The music speaks directly to me and I suspect a great many others.

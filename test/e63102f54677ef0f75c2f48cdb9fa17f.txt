Wow!
They're spelled diferently!
I love his Cthulhu stories, but that's just what they are...stories.
That means it must be true!
Its called DELUSIONAL.If you don't believe me, then buy this book, cast the spells, and see if Cthlulhu comes.
Lovecraft was one of the greatest Gothic FICTION writers of the twentieth century.
Sorry to disappoint all you Goth kids out there.And no, just because you believe in something doesn't make it true.
There's a word for people who think that way.
?KUTULU...AZAG THOTH.
How long has this book been out?
The Old One's aren't coming.
H.P.
Almost twenty years?
Look it up in the dictionary.
If all someone had to do was recite one of the spells, don't you think Cthulhu or Yog Sothoth would have broken through by now??
Losers.

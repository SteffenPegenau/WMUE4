Neil Patrick Harris?
But he's great at spitting while acting.
At least he didnt sell out and wrap it all up with a happy face.
Hmmmm.
Harris, well, he's Harris, can't stretch it that much.
Matthew Lillard?
Its a harsh movie, but bareable.
How come I've never heard of this one?
But Gabriel Olds wasn't too bad, reminds me of Jared Leto.
Well, I don't think either of them will be putting this on their resumes, as if they really needed to fill them up anyway!
But he does give you a lot to think about.
The movie is crammed with social commentary, something the director wants to expand upon, but can't decide whether it be on the disfunctional school system, family and teen angst, or satan.
I actually liked it, even though most wont.
Lillard need to quit playing the psycotic teenager, we've seen it before, and better in SCREAM.
Not bad, but a little sloppy.

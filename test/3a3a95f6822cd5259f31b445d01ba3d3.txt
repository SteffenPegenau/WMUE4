The cooker has six heat levels .
.
I presume that if I used the cooker for a long time that the electronics would fail.
As I use it only to cook eggs for a few minutes .
Something in it was out gassing.
.
.
Couldn't be good to breath whatever it was.The unit had a fan, presumably to cool the electronics.
something that was hard to get out of the marketing info at the time I bought the unit.
It worked for a couple of weeks and no longer does so.
The unit smelled when I first got it and continued to for a week or two after.
for about a month now.The induction part of it works fine heating an iron skillet quickly and with good control over the heat.
it continues to function .

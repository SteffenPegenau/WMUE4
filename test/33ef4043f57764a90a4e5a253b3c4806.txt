It's so easy to use.
I love my all-in-one.
Its big and doesn't fit on a standard PC desk.
Lexmark printers are dependable and easy to understand.
The photos I printed were not as pretty as the ones I print with my cheaper Lexmark Z715.
Were constantly having problems with it.
We recently got a refurbished one.
So, I'm keeping that one for photos.
I don't know how customer service is because, I've never needed them.Lexmark does have a bad rep at work.
I use my Z23 on my older (kids) PC.
I think the problem lies with my company being cheap and not with Lexmark products.
I own 3 printers.
It's a larger business size.
The downsides!
Excellant product for the price.

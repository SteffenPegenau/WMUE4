Moderately pricy unless purchased in a bulk pack.
If handy make the cut-outs for the vertical posts, and a few screws secured to horizontal rails.
Built the rest with only 2 x 4s and saved a ton of money, since brackets at each of 5 shelves = 15 brackets.
Rot/Decay Resistant.
But you can cut inserts and patch them in, like I did.
Versatile for custom design assemblies.
Useful as base supports to align/square 2x4 uprights and rails for multi-shelf storage.
That leaves voids on the ends and middle, and looks cosmetically crude.
instructions and cut half sheets for shelving.
I used 3 of them to create the base for a 84" high x 104" long x 16" deep storage unit.
Requires fasteners through pre-drilled holes for safe, sturdy assembly.
Don't know how it will hold up under UV-sun exposure.
Brackets on each end and one at the mid-span.
Very sturdy!
Otherwise, follow mfg.
A little tricky to install continuous shelving board.
Accepts standard grade 2 x 4s.
Reasonable design.

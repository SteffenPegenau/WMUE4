Then, my friend did us all a favor: he turned off.
The game board was right out of Mario Party and didn't look too exciting.
I first got a taste of it at my friend's party last weekend.
We persisted.
Sadly, the rest of the guests cheered.
Well, the excitement wore off as soon as we started playing.
We wanted to like it!
But it's not like we didn't give it a chance!
The mini-games were dull and too short.Before too long, the other guests watching were getting bored out of their minds.
We were both pumped to play it and couldn't wait for other guests to arrive so we could have four people playing at once.
It starts off slow and does not pick up.
I'm gonna get this out of the way right now: this game is aggravating.
I'm sticking with board games.
Not the sign of a good game.
And so were the people playing.

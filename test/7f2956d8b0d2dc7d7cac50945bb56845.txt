I love these universal hooks.
I used several of these last year to hold up my christmas lights on my house.
So, instead of using the clip, I put several of these hooks along my gutters and strung my lights up.
What more can I ask for.
They can hold about anything and they don't cause any damage!
If you haven't tried these yet you don't know what you are missing.
: )
I didn't think they would work but sure enough they did.
I just don't like having to lift up the shingles in order to get the clip secured underneath the shingle.
OK...so these hooks are the answer to all of my problems.
Just a tip....
I will never use the roof clips again.
I hate the clips that go under the roof shingles.
It worked great!
They hold things very well and they do not damage my walls.

The director should have made her a mute advanced nuke wiz kid.
Whenever she opened her mouth, bad lines, along with bad acting, would spill out.
Her roll in the film detracted from the films seriousness and, I my opinion, ranks "The World is Not Enough" as the number 2 Bond stinker right after "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" with George Lazenby.
Locations exotic.
Good lord!
They just want to forget it ever existed.
That is if I can't remove the Denise Richards (Chrismas Jones) scenes without destroying the overall plot line.
I need to get busy.
Which is what I will try to do with "The World is Not Enough."
The action was great.
Thats because it was so bad nobody will talk about it.
In the womb?
Plot believable.
Charactors interesting, with the exception of one.
The only reason she was in the film was because of her sweat body.
Chrismas Jones.
Don't know that Bond movie?
When did she start her study of advanced nuke physics?

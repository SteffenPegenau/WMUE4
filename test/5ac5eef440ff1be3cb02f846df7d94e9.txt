MUCH more.
For a 50 dollar crock, I expect more.
It is handy to cook in it on the stove top.
Flaked off, so it may have made its way into some food, and in case you don't know, teflon is highly toxic.
With mine, the teflon completely wore off the sides of the rim.
But the peeling teflon rendered it unusable.
I had a ceramic crock before this and that burned EVERYTHING.But be wary.
Its also not hideous to look at.
However - DON'T drop it, and be fantastically careful about the lid.
It hardly ever burned anything, even on high, which is really only meant for cooking things for an hour or two, tops, anyway.
Its temp control was very good.
The crock tub is also very thin metal and obviously the target of cost-cutting.
Stainless steel may be better - most foods in the crock cook down and bleed their juices out anyway, so sticking concerns are overblown.
It was great at first - it seldom burns food and the lid fits very snugly.
I've had this crock for years.

It didn't have the "comicbook" look to it like the others.
You can see it if you must but...
Anyone can look like Batman, but only some can look like Bruce Wayne.
The only one who has been spoke of that could do worse is Kurt Russel.
Val Kilmer is the best Batman.
It looked like New York.
Like old cars and so on.
It's nowhere near as good as Forever.
You didn't get as much of a Gotham feel.
Micheal Keaton was without a doubt the WORST BATMAN!
An old, fat, short ugly Bruce Wayne isn't exactly what most picture as Batman.
(boy would his gut show then)
This film is crummy.
The suit wasn't tight enough, so it was flopping around on his face.
At least he dosn't wear tights!

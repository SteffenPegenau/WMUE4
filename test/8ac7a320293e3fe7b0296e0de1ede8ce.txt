Third time is the charm, right?
I'm through with Western Digital, at least with this product.
Got the replacement today.
nope.
I received no apology letters or emails, no expressions of concerns for my troubles, or even offers to pay for shipping.
Same issue.
Don't go through the same trouble I did.
"Click...click...click...click."
I thought, this couldn't happen 3 times, could it?
I purchased this product from Amazon.
Received it in the mail, was so excited when I plugged it in, and all I heard was "click...click...click...click".
Sent it in, got it again 1 week later.
After researching the forums, I learned my drive was faulty and had to be sent in to be replaced.
Had to package myself and pay for shipping once again.
Fine, no problem.
SAME EXACT PROBLEM AS THE LAST TWO DRIVES.
No response from my computer.

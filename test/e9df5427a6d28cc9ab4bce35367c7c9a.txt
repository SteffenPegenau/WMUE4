Honest!
My drill worked fine for about a year.
I own a lot of Makita tools and I am an ardent supporter, but I would not recommend this tool.
Then I knocked it off a 4 foot step ladder.
There are a lot of plastic gears in there.
I should have heeded that warning.
Very disappointed.
Something in the gear assembly gave out.
Couldn't find the broken part.
I decided to upgrade and bought this drill based on a test in Wood magazine.
I disassembled it.
It's a tank.
I have been using the 9.6 volt drill for years.
It broke.
I had to return 2 of them due to excessive play in the shaft the chuck is attached to.
It fell about 2 feet into a pile of leaves and mulch.

It is worth the money.
It is almost too late by that time!
This journal really helped me sort out my feelings.
It provokes you to write, as it is a fun journal.
I was surprised how important it was to write while you are pregnant.
Buy it right away, if you are pregnant.
I also bought her a thorough baby book, so that is really more for her.
This book is about being pregnant, which is often not written about by the mom.
I highly recommend this book.
Usually we focus on baby more and not our experience of pregnancy.
I bought it on a whim and I was glad that I did.
Buy this!
I highly recommend this journal.
I really wouldn't wait until your 3rd trimester.
You may find it more fun to write in this than to stare at a blank journal.
I bought this journal is primarily for myself and maybe less for the baby, although my daughter may one day find it interesting reading, when she is pregnant.

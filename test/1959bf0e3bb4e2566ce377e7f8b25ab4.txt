2 weeks later I procedded to the second hole.
There was no issues, both cats went fine.
Maybe trying to train 2 cats is too much.
The girl cat however refused to use it and peed and pooped elsewhere.
So we moved at a slower pace.
The boy cat at this point would use it even when I took the tray complatly out.
I bought this 3 months ago.
I am going back to a litter box this weekend.
The boy cat took to it right away.
The girl cat was slower.
I have 2 cats, a boy and a girl, both who are 3.
She just does not like it.
Just jumps on the toilet and does his business.
After 2 weeks of no holes, I finnally did the first hole.
She will poop in it, but prefers to pee on carpet.
For the last 2 months I have kept the full tray in there.
I finnally went back to the full tray with no holes hoping to start over.

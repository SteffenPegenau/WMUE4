I purchased this as a gift.
It continues to seize up, refuse to turn on and assorted other problems.
I have been on the phone with these folks numbers of times.
Choose something else!!
Mintek lady calls me and says they just received it and will send it back in (5) FIVE weeks.
!
I'm no genius on laser optics and all the gearing involved, but that does not sound like a great "fix".
No... evidently it comes in with a "Batch" and can only go out with a "Batch".
Now I have sent it to them to replace.
Evidently Mintek only ships stuff out every 5 weeks of so.
The tech lady said "just take your finger and slide the optics back and forth a few times... that usually fixes it.." Well..
I have visions of young Chinese with their fingers on the optics sliding them back and forth....Bottom line...
It seized up.
I yelled "put a new one in the mail and send it."
If you have a choice.
Christmas day we had to call Mintek.

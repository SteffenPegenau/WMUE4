Anyway, the only company Evan has at his Aunt's house is his cocker-spaniel Trigger.
But there is something very strange about the Monster Blood.
Andy and Evan go to this old toy store in the town to find a birthday present for Andy's cousin.
We'll, let's just say curiosty killed the cat.
Her name is Andrea but everybody calls her Andy.
Aunt Kathryn is totally deaf and can't hear a thing.
He buys the blood and takes it home.
The Monster Blood turns out to be a horrifying surprise.
Evan and his family are moving to Atlanta.
She has refused to learn to lip-read or learn sign language.
While in the shop Evan finds this cool can of Monster Blood.
Then Evan meets a girl who lives a few blocks away.
It keeps getting bigger and bigger.
The only problem with this is that Evan has to go to his weird Aunt Kathyrin's.
What does the cat have anything to do with it?
Aunt Kathyrin also has this creepy black cat.
Evan hates it over there.

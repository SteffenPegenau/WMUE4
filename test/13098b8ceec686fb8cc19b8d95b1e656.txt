This has a VERY classic Southern rock feel to it..
This would be one.Way Beyond Empty.
I would absolutely say..
This is one of the ALL TIME ...
It still has enough overdrive to twist your nipples.
IF.. you are looking for Heavy Metal Fist in your face rock.. Move on..
((THE BEST composition of ZAKK'S CAREER !!))If..
This CD is his Apex release.
This isnt for you..
But.. Don't get me wrong..
This CD is a Masterful creation, In my opinion.
It .. and ZAKK.. deserved much more recognition, than it got..This release.. is a great Mix of his Pride and Glory era, and a healthy dose of The Black Label society.. A perfect storm as i would describe it...To me..
I had to make a list of 10 Recordings I could take with me to a deserted Island.
UNDER RATED releases of all time..
To sum this release up..
Is one of my favorite tunes..

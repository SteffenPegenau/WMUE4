Hey, can't we work something out?
-DJO'B
The story is a downward spiral filled with characters who are always asking, 'why me?'
.
(Umph, it doesn't even dawn on them.)
Face your demons, people!
Massoud, Kathy and Lester work up a frenzy that gives humanity a black eye.
.
and never looking beyond the muck of sand and fog.
If that's the point, a work well done.
albeit affected by how ugly we can be.
A woman in the habit of carelessness loses her house via county auction and a hardworking immigrant gets a bargain.
Not really.
The story left me agitated .
While a few peripheral characters share tiny moments of kindness, their portrayals are left in the dust.
While Andre Dubus III takes his readers into the minds of Massoud Behrani, Kathy Nicolo and her hopeless lover Lester Burdon, he also sticks us in a rut that's knee-deep in self-deception, selfishness, prejudice.

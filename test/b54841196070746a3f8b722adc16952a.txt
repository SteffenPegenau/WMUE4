Arrival 2.
I have heard "Bittersweet" and it was incredible.
Be 4.
Mama 7.
In fact all of the songs are very very good.If you like melodic music I strongly recommend you this album.
SiberiaThis CD was the first Maarty Friedman CD of mine.
Loneliness 8.
It sounds like classical music played by guitar, keyboard and drums.
It was so melodic that I felt like I was listening melodies from heaven.I couldn't find it in my home country so tried to search it on the internet.
No vocals.
Luna 6.
The track listing I found was the one given by amazon.com and that's why I have mentioned the listing here.As you may know, Marty Friedman is Megadeth's guitarist but this album is far away from Megadeth's style.
Escapism 5.
First of all, the correct track listing of the album is as follows:1.
My personal favorites are: "Bittersweet", "Be", "Loneliness".
Bittersweet 3.

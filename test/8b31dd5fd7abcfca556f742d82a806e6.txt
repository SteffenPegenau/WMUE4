I'm sure Grisham doesn't care--he has plenty of fans and doesn't need me!
In my opinion, he failed miserably!
He does, after all, enthrall millions of readers so he has to be doing something right.
It's not even Grisham's best!
If not, skip it.
I think men would like Grisham's books a lot more than women--he has yet to create a good and believable female character.
I swore I would never read another Grisham book.
Well, I hated the book, but I can't say Grisham is bad.
I'll give Grisham this, he does do a good job of weaving the two plot strands together and he is good at plotting.
His plots, however, all turn out to be formulaic and anti-climactic.
But so many CAN'T be wrong and me right!
Understandable.
The beginning of the book is so boring I almost gave up during the first chapter.
If you're a Grisham fan, buy this book.
So--I tried this book and gave Grisham another chance.

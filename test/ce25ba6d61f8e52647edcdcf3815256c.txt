I listened to the rest of the songs.
This one is going to be a biggie in the next couple of months.
They are all great!
You've got an awesome CD.
Well usually on a CD, you might get a couple of good ones.
People that don't normally listen to country will like it.
I listen to it over and over!Thanks, Steve
I listened to the first song and thought it was very good.
There are slow ones fast ones a good mix.
My favorite is "Another nine minutes".
This CD is very addictive.
I really like the fact their songs take a tough situation in an upbeat way.
Anyone who has to get up in the morning and go to work will love this song.
Congratulations fellas !
They are just as good in concert also.
I think they have a little bit of "Alabama mixed with 38 Special".

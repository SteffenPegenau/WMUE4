I would be embarrassed to have my name on the cover of this book.
The errors go beyond annoying and are often distracting.
Nonetheless, they seem to know the subject matter well, and I have gleaned some useful insights.
Flip back a page, forward a page...maybe this is the right chart.
I didn't realize the description was literal.
Very sloppy!
My bad.
The errors are numerous.
The reading is generally pretty dry, and one only barely gets the sense the authors have done any trading themselves.
Don't either of you have a grad student that needs a project?
Yes, this must be the one they are really talking about.
Sloppy!
E.g., several charts are mislabeled.
The reader is referred to chart "xx.x" and quickly realizes the narrative is totally unrelated to the chart in question.
My chief complaint, however, is the poor editing (or maybe a lack thereof).
This book is exactly what it claims to be...a textbook.

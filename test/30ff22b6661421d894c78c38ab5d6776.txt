The kid was really handsome and charismatic.
I mean, get real.
But for all true River Phoenix fans, that's what we want.
I had hoped that this book would be an album of his life, something, perhaps that would explain his death.
This title merely collects a bunch of really great magazine cover type photography.
Of course, this book doesn't provide one and doesn't try.
An answer to why he's gone.
What's disappointing is that it is not a photo biography of the subject.
That's a tall order, I know, from a photo book.
Everything is staged.
You want this only if you are an unabashed fan of River Phoenix.
What we don't get, and what just does not really exist for River, is a chronicle of his career and his exuberant personality -- in photos.
It's just got a ton of great pictures.
The only serious works on him are two biographies of dubious value.
It offers little else than some interesting text and a ton of photos of River in the last year or two of his life (he died at age 23).

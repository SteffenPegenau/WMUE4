THE RASH FOR WEEKS IS NOT WORTH IT!!
Sadly, I was trying to save money, but it's not worth it.
Not only did the razors not shave my legs, it took a "minimum" of four runs!!
DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM!!!!!
You will end up with razor rash; they are not sharp at all, and will only bring misery.
YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!
EVER!!!
DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!
PLEASE!!!
!Do you know what that does to legs?
These were obviously refurbished razors and repackaged.
!
THEY ARE "REFURBISHED BLADES OR FAKES!!!!".
DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!
DO NOT BUY THESE!!!
I ended up buying replacements in the grocery store, but at least I had a clean shave.

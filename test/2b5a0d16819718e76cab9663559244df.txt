And thank-you greatly for a clean/edited version.
And his crew rocks the house too.
It is a mature, well-grounded and established sound.
There is nothing weak about it.
He knows there is other talent besides himself.
IT IS FANTASTIC!
The hits just don't stop!
He sends out some positive messages and doesn't boast about being better than anyone else or being "the greatest" unlike a lot of rapper/MCs out there.
His voice, style, abilities, creativity, etc., are exceptional.
Krayzie and crew, EXCELLENT WORK!
Krayzie Bone is simply incredible.
The beats, rythms, and all the accompaniment are polished and accomplished, like the sound of a true music veteran.
This is easily one of my favortie cds.
Now that's a smart man.
This is a fabulous work of art.
Krayzie has his own unique sound that you know is not copied.

I wear a medium size 6.
In fact I have 2 pairs of the Skechers D'Lites Opal mules.
I may try a "wide" version of this shoe but not sure.
BUT thinking the D'lites were comfortable so should these slip on shoes.
The size is not true to fit in my opinion.
I'll stick to your mules.
I live in them and they are so comfortable.
Boy was I wrong.
It was so painful trying to get them to slip on my feet.
I have had other "new" slip on shoes that did not go on as tight as these.
These were much narrower.
At any rate, I did not keep them and sent them back.
I ordered a size 6 for these shoes.My other Skechers are a size 6M.
I love Skechers shoes.
When I compared the front of this shoe to my other skechers shoes, my other shoes showed a wider appearance as compared to these.
Sorry Skechers you blew it on this style shoe for me.

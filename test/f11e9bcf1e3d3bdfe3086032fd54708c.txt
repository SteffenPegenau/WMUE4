I thought "it can't be camera, probably I am making some mistakes".
After I bought it, pictures was not coming good.
(If anyone want to see them I can send via E-mail and all other pictures I took.
Instead of getting an apology, it cost me money and lots of time.
You should see the differences.
All they talk is "policy".
Finally I invited one of my friend who has 2 Mpixel Minolta Camera.
I tried everything for one week.
This is not a good quality product.
I wonder "is there a policy about sending inferior product and labeling it 4 megapixel".Now, I have to pay restocking fee.
We took same pictures with two different cameras.
No progress at all.
It does not hold any battery even Ni-MH.Costumer service is not satisfactory.
)Battery life is another story.
Do not expect even fair pictures.
They deliberately does not discuss the quality.
We set the tripod.
His pictures far better than mine.

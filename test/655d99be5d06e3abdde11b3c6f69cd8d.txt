This is defenetly ONE TO REMEMBER!!
I loved it!!
You follow Ratha from her cub-hood struggles to her adult life.
So well, infact it made me cry!
I'm sure most who read the book would agree with me when I say this book is the best!
On a scale of one-ten I give it a ten!!
Ratha's creature came highly recomened by my big brother.
This is mostly why I liked it I think.
A wonderfull book and I recomend it to people who like books about animals with human emotions.
If Clare Bell is reading this, I beg you to not deprive others of such a phenomenal book and put it back in print!!!
The emotions are so real that you can feel Ratha's joy and saddness.
I'm so glade I didn't ignore his recomendation!!
This is my first time reading anything by Clare Bell, and I think I will read more.
I normaly take a month to finish a short book,{out of lack of intrest in them} but it took me only two days to finish Rasha's Creature!

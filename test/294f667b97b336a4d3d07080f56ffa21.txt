And the Scarecrow will never be better than Mr. Wogglebug.
Jack Pumpkinhead is so nice.
I love the new characters.
This book is full of statements (mostly made by the Scarecrow) that make this book highly unrecommendable to children.
It is really meant to be a continuing story of the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman.
I have read all 14 of L. Frank Baum's Oz books.
Ozma is most definitely the rightful ruler of Oz.
But everyone in Oz is so unpleasent to him.
They would have given me the worst thoughts.
And throughout most of the story the Tin Woodman actually proves that he doesn't really have a heart.
And Mr. Wogglebug is just as exasperatingly lovable as Mr. Toad of Toad Hall.
He should only be loved.
This is the first sequal.
And not a very good one either.
So I'm glad I wasn't read the Oz books as a child.

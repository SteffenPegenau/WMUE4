In a way I guess it is.
It was like walking in on a movie that's about a third of the way in.I also feel that the term 'horror' on the book's spine is a misnomer.
.
Again, I'm just a little disappointed that there wasn't more for these wonderful characters to do.I'm sure Mr. Hoffman has an idea where the story arc is going.
I wanted to care about them in this story.
Perhaps when all four installments are in place, I can look at the whole story in a different light and rate it a bit higher.
Ouch!
It is the characters alone that get the two stars.
I did not read Hungry Eyes, so many of the returning characters were most probably fleshed out in that novel.
.In his Author's Afterword, Mr. Hoffman states that he wanted this to be a stand-alone novel.
I really did.
'Suspense' would be more apt.Eyes of Prey is a quick read.
However .
First reviewer.Mr.
Hoffman created some wonderful characters in this novel.

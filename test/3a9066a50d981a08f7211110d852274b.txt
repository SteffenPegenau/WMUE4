At first the smell is very strong but pleasant.
Blending the old with the new is nice, however you end up with some "gaps".
I live in an old farmhouse that has been renovated several times.
Traps worked, but catching them one at a time and resetting the traps was too much.
I hate to do that, but so far the mice are definately gone!
Then I read about the peppermint oil.
After the smell was gone, the mice were back.
Good luck.
I would suggest to use the peppermint first.
I soaked some cotton rounds and place them in and around the kitchen draws and pantry.
I worked for a while, but you have to continually resoak the cotton.
It wears off in a few days and I think the mice get used to it.
It does work, but I guess it depends on how many rodents you have to chase away!
These allow the woodland creatures free range for getting into the house!
Eventually, I gave up and used decon.

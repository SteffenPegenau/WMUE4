You don't like her, I mean she's too mean!
or somthing like that.
For one thing Marilla's character was horrible.
And the Berry's were bad.
First of all, Mrs. Rachel Lynde's character is now Mrs. Barry the mother of Diana Barry.
It happens too fast and is not a verry good quality of a movie.
The movie is too short, they cut almost HALF of the book out.
I would give that a 5!!
And that ending is tarrible, Marilla saying, "I'm going to go fetch Gilbert."
Second, Diana's traditional racen black hair is now BLOND!!!
If you wan't to see a version of Anne Of Green Gables see the remake with Megan Follows.
The characters were twisted the plot was changed, in short it was tarrible.
!
I saw this movie a week ago on TMC and hated it!!!!
Mathew, Gilbert, and Anne were great, but everyone else got twisted characters or just did not look like the part at all.

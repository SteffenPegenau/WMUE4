I mostly use the lavendar and peppermint liquid soaps.
Everything smells SO FRESH when you use the peppermint!
Wonderful for the dog too!!
I also love to scrub my toilet &bathroom at home.
These soaps are the BEST!
I use Peppermint and Lavendar a lot when camping.
I use them for many reasons - but when camping they keep away most of the flying/biting insects including mosquitoes.
I mix with water and spray the camping area.
But you guessed it - the peppermint completely took the bad smell out!
I'm a walking advertisment for this GREAT PRODUCT.
Use it once, and you will become addicted.
I had an old blanket that STUNK from our old dog sleeping on it, and then storing it for a year in the basement.
NOTHING worked to get the smell out.
You can clean EVERYTHING with them.
I could go on and on; but after you try it you'll understand why.
When washing my hair/face/hands in the camp ground - everyone always wants to try it.

It has a good plot.
And why, may I ask, have they no children yet?
I thought that the fans of Star Wars would be thrilled to see Luke as a father.
Too ordinary.
This may be a Star Wars book, but that is no reason why a few literary niceties can't be included.
Second, are Luke and Mara really in love?
The galaxy is no longer some big, happy playground where no one of importance gets hurt.
Finally, the safety of the characters is no longer assured, adding to the tension.
Firstly, I'd like to say what I liked about this book.
Because they sure aren't acting like it?
They're both getting to old.
The writing style is very ordinary.
Something needs to be done about this.
The characterisations - with the exception of Han and Mara (few people get them right) - are good.Now for what I didn't like.
It starts of in a new direction, and breathes a little life into that far away galaxy.
The Solo children have their own personalites.

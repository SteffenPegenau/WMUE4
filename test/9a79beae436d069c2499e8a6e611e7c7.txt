The first printing... maybe.
!I'm not a teacher or anything but the mistakes were glaring and embarassing.
I won't be reading his 1st book but I will be reading what he puts out next.
4 years down the line is just plain stupid!!
This was his second book and you can tell.
When the action did start, however, it was good.
!
If anything, this shows how much an author can grow over time.
Also, when I'm really pushing to get my customers to read stories by Black authors this doesn't help at all.
Part of the reason is because I've read 4 of K'wan's later work and REALLY liked them.
I didn't really like this book.
It says this book was put out in 2003.
You think they would have fixed all the typos and mis-spelled words in FOUR years!!
It started off too slow and took too long to get to the action.
You have to wait until the end of the book and that is why I didn't it.I was wondering what his earlier work was like... and now I know.

I should have known better when they didn't say what it was made of.
Very thin.
I have purchased costumes from other makers for a lot less and much better quality.
For $58.00 it wasn't worth it.
But the Coat was made of very thin material.
I needed a red pirates coat with red cuffs and this is the only one I could find that was long enough.
I will have to put in a liner to make it less flimsy.
This is made by Fun World.
This is like womens summer pajama material.
FAR FROM IT!
(And that was this year!
I did receive the item on time!
It looks nice, don't get me wrong.
)Hat is a soft foam like material.
They said this was a QUALITY COSTUME in the description.

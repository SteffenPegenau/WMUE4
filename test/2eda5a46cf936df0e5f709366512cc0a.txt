Now you have the most amazing toy on the beach.
Screw together again.
Remove the small spring that snaps in the locking piece.
You have to disable the excavator lock that holds up the arm.
Another thing is that the rotation of the arm is limited to left and right by a few degrees.
It does not need the lock.
Remove the locking piece.
Look under the unit and cut/grind off the turning limiting knob for full rotation.
However it can be worked clean and does not break.
This is what you need to do to make it fun.
I bought it a year ago.
You do not need this lock because there is a bigger spring in the grey cylinder that can hold the arm up.
It frustrates kids.
For the money it is the greatest.
Sand may get into this cylinder and bind it up.
If it breaks buy another for parts.
You have remove the screws that hold the arm together.

A singer shredding his vocal chords just to shatter the ear drums of an attentive audience.
Prepared to be rocked like a million metaphors associated with the word rock.
Into "Menergy" that's where.Yes this album rocks!
No Matchbox 20's burnin this brick house down.Seriously, if you want to remember what it was like to Rock?
No!!!
Rock on over to your music store and grab this Rock album.
And it rocks hard!
Something not considered "Emo" or "Alternative" or a hundred other things.
Guitars, Bass, Drums?
Only to emerge with one question, "Where's rock?"
Not the rock you smoke, the rock you hear, the rock you feel, the rock you live.
Rock of Ages!
And prepare to get ROCKED!
!
Where did it all go?
For the last year or two, I've been diving head first into a giant vat of hiphop lifestyles.
ROCK remember?
When was the last good rock album anyway?
Then don't sit there like a Rock.
The riffs are well thought out, the style is fearless, and the structure is solid.

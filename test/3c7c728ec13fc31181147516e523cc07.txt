The game is a solid 4 or 5 stars.
With the 3 install max...
Screw you EA.
Give them ALL a 1 star rating.
This game is fun as heck to play.
I hate this crap.
I bought it but I did NOT know about the DRM.
Of course you should do this after really playing the game but no game in the world would ever be worth anything higher than 1 star given that it has DRM.
Screw you EA for making my life more difficult when I want to play your games.I hope everyone gives this game a bad review.
I'm SCREWED.
I'll have to look for a hack for the game that I legally purchased.
We should do this to all DRM games.
I am a person who like to install it, play it through once, uninstall it, pick it up a month or more and reinstall it, etc.
Add DMR and this game deserves a 1 star at MOST.
Let's send grass root opinions to these executives.
I wasted $50 on you jerks.

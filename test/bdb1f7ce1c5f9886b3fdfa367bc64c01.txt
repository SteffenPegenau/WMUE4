Do they even have a bassist?
Ugh!
All songs sound the same2.)
I sure as heck can't hear the bass.3.)
Listen to some real music like Bon Jovi, people.
He sounded like a dying cat6.)
I was excited- a new album to listen to!
So I was taking a walk around this old junkyard and was rummaging though a pile of trash and found this album on cassette.
The songs were generic and uncreativeAlso, they were never on MTV or BET!
The guitarist was awful4.)
My mom made me leave the house for the first time in years or I would be grounded from World Of Warcraft for a week!
Here's why:1.)
I put it in my Walkman from 1993 and hoped for an awesome album (hopefully as good as "St.Anger").
What a disappointment!
The drumming was so simple, all in 4/45.)
I hated this album!
So that's an automatic fail.
The vocals were horrid!

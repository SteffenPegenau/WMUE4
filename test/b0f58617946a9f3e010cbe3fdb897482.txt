So I went into this with the highest hopes and this story fails utterly.
In conclusion, I love D&D and I love fantasy movies.
I have to write this review to warn people who might otherwise be drawn in.
1) Bad Plot - I won't spoil it just suffice to say its weak and poorly thrown together.
Won't just take my word for it?
I have seen the movie and skimed the book.
2) Bad Characters - While not as bad as the plot the characters are still very poorly thought out.
Good for you.
Here are just a few of many reasons to dislike this story.
I would loose several hours of my life forever and never get that time back.
3) And to top it off the theme is bad - Yes I know how can the theme truly be evaluated?
The answer is that this theme certanly can.
PS - if you liked the movie you will actually like the book.
Buyer beware.
OK first off I have not read the book.
I will never read the book just as I will never read any of the "Sweet Vally High" series.

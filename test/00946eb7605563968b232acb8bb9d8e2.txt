I found the keyboard very comfortable.
selecting upwards and hitting the HOME key.
Keep the SHIFT key pressed and press the down arrow key to select the lines of text.
This happens with the reverse also i.e.
I returned my keyboard.
Keep your cursor at the beginning of a line.
I found a problem with this keyboard.
I dont know it was specific to my piece of if it is problem with this model.
Please note that this is PS/2 keyboard and if your computer has only USB ports, then dont buy this.
The cursor moved to the end of the line but the whole selection is lost.
The problem comes when we try to select multiple lines to text using the SHIFT + Arrow keys and then the END or HOME keys.
When you reach the last line you want to select, press the END key to complete selection of last line.
Haven't decided which one to buy to replace this.
Here is how you can reproduce this problem.
This might not seem like a a big issue but it irritated me a lot.

And where are their doctors?
She was so wrong, I wish there was a way I could successfully sue her to get my two bucks back.
I like seeing beautiful women naked!
I just don't get it...
It was recommended to me by the clerk at my local video store, who promised me it had "the best transformation effects ever!"
It is wretched.
And I'm male!
Why do so many people like this bomb?
I could go on listing reasons why this movie reeks to high heaven, but if you're reading this, chances are you're considering watching it no matter what I say.
I think she meant to say "worst" f/x ever.
Half the "plot" of the movie only exists to present one nudity-laden scene after another.
So go ahead.
And the rest of the movie follows suit.
This is insulting.
But you have been warned.
But I also like movies to have at least SOME substance to them.
Reading some of these other reviews, I cannot for the life of me figure out why so many people like this movie.

The babes made the movie enjoyable for guys.
In the halls, I always hear "I saw BUR!!
It's cold in here.
This movie, has a lot of Laugh Out Loud humor.
I say there most be some toros on the atmosphere!
Girls, I think they love this movie.
I found many of the jokes funny (especially the male cheerleaders!).
What a great movie.
I saw it with a bunch of guys and we thought it was half-decent.
It's just the way things are.
It'll be stuck in your head i warn.
Girls will love it and guys will enjoy it.
The story was pretty corny in some ways but it was very entertaining.
In the end, i think this movie is worth seeing.
She is a very talented actress and I look forward to seeing her in many other movies.
Kirsten (not Kristen) Dunst is a true beauty.

And she knew how to play to the camera.
She had good timing.
And it didn't lie.
If you like Anna, go for it.
If she isn't your cup of tea, don't bother.
It's funny in places, dumb in places.
Knowing all we know now about her and her life, you really have to look at this in a different light.
I have to be fair.
Sort of like Anna herself was.
The outtakes are funny.
The truth is, when she was on the screen, you have problems remembering anyone else is in the shot.
But it's Anna.
Don't think it was supposed to be.
You won't find much in it as far as plot.
This was not ever presented as Oscar Worthy in any way shape or form.
It's worth what I paid for it; but then of course I bought it dirt cheap second hand.The plot isn't memorable.

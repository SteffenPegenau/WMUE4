Well, when Donovan hit Kate across the mouth and sent her flying, I almost vomited.
But this one?
Those other 3 books I mentioned?
First of all, I must tell you that I ADORE Mary Jo Putney's work.
But I was very disappointed.
Boring.
I know MJP tackles "issues" (alcoholism, etc.)
Family and domestic life stopped until I finished those!
Nope.
As everyone else has said - try it - and decide for yourself.
I knew there was going to be more trouble when I could put the book down and NOT want to pick it up.
I knew there was trouble when on Pg.
But I kept telling myself that this was Mary Jo Putney and that the story was bound to improve.
1 the background profession was going to be demolition.
I knew I couldn't read this book.
Some of her books - The Rake, Shattered Rainbows and One Perfect Rose- are on my keepers shelf forever.
and I knew this was her first foray into contemporary but it wasn't the book for me.

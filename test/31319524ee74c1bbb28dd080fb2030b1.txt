It's like someone wrote this book without even reading any of the other books.
Where's all the other horses?
If your going to write a book in a series make sure you read the rest of the books in the series before hand.
there is NO way they'd A) let Ashleigh give Christina Legacy!
what?
how?
what happened.
and B) there is ABSOLUTELY NO way they'd let Christina GIVE him away!!
Where's Cindy?
what happened to Glory?
They have a half interest in this horse so how can they just give him away.
Ok so what happened?
when?
Where's Ashleigh's baby?
is she still with Tor??
What happened to the Townsends?
I kept on checking to make sure i hadn't missed a book in the series because i was so confused!
Samantha took off to Ireland?!?!!?

I wasn't quite as impressed with it.
A little too heavy on sex and drugs, etc...
I do not, however, see this as a young adult novel.
But, gradually, that improved, and I found myself loving Weetzie.
Well, when I finished that, I checked out some more Block books from the public library.
I love it.I posted about reading Necklace of Kisses a while back.
Ok, so really I just want to go out for coffee and share our writing.
It is very adult.
I love them, and they may be written on the reading level of a teenager, but they are not what I would call teen material.
First, I read Weetzie Bat.
I want to incorporate some of her magic into my writings.
The beginning felt too quick.
I think I want to marry her.
As all of Block's books have been, so far.
No story development.

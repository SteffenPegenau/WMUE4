(The points of my current purchase were dull.)
The objective was to pick up as many sticks as possible with high point counts.
The pick_up_sticks of my childhood were shorter, lighter, and significantly thinner than these.
I am an old guy - 67 years old.
Sigh.
It could be that our society's obsession with safety (sharp points, etc.)
The wood was finished and varnished.
I was quite disappointed.
The point count depended on the color of the stick.
This game/novelty really didn't cut it.
The 1950's pick_up_sticks had sharp points, which were useful to use as a tool to pickup other sticks.
may be the culprit here.
Had I not been exposed to "the real thing," I might have been satisfied with these.
The game of my childhood had a light, natural wood color.
But, alas, I had been previously exposed to the "real thing."
I was trying to capture a part of my childhood by purchasing a game/novelty that used to captivate me when I was a child.

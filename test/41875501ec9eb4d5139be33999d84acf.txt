So I've decided it's just going to be easier (and patriotic?)
to replace the two cheap, non-working latches with functional locking versions.
I bought this trunk based on all the great reviews.
The plastic is so thin, it wouldn't take 15 seconds to cut through...
Oh well.
One latch is too loose to latch.
Using finger nail clippers...
Maybe I have a new, cheaper model?
At least its "Made in USA", which I prefer.
The top is so flimsy I could leave the lock on, unlatch the cheap lockless latches, and lift the corners 4", getting to everything inside.I'd return it, but then what?
Seriously... Nail clippers.
But why even bother with that?
This trunk rated so well.
And I will beef up the handle because I do not believe single rivets through that thin plastic are going to hold any weight.
And the hole for the lock?
Why bother?
The other was installed so crooked it wouldn't latch at all.

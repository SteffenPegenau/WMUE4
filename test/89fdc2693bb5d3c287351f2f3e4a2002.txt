Apparently so did the Yankees.
I'm a huge Yankee fan and read a lot of books about the Yanks.
He was no longer wearing pinstripes shortly after this book came out.
3 out of 5 stars...
I loved Graig Nettles as a player, but this book was a bit annoying for me.
Everything is always an issue.
He comes across as a pretty selfish and self absorbed guy in this book.
He put all his thoughts out there in this book, which took a lot of guts... but reading his list of complaints gets boring and I came away from this book with a little less love for Nettles.
He should be paid more.
I hate to say it, but he did it to himself.
He can't stand George.
He complains and complains, non-stop.
He's still a great Yankee, but less great to me after reading his laundry list of complaints.
He's not getting enough respect.
He's better than this player or that player.

I was planning on buying a PS2 solely to play GT3 and 4.
You can add your own soundtracks.
The steering, throttle, and braking is a little touchy.
Tons of cars and tracks.
It is also difficult to keep high powered, rear wheel drive cars from peeling out and turning sideways (suped up vette or mustang).
There are no stupid license tests.
You can customize your car to look however you want.
There are plenty of adjustments to make the game as easy or as hard as you can handle.
Good sound and graphics.
It is difficult to make slight turns.
Better than anything I have played on Xbox or PS2.
I love the XBOX.
The only thing I dont like is that you cannot adjust the sensitivity.
It is now my favorite racing game.
Not anymore.
Tons of upgrades.
I love this game!

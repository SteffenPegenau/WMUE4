Im now at the end of the 1st day after the detox feeling alful.
there is no one to ask what to do.
I followed the book page by page for the detox.
I continued to the Fast Track One Day Detox.
in two weeks.
I am 48yrs old- read the book The Fat Flush Plan.
I started the detox at 133lb (I needed to loose at least 13 more lb) The problem is that I woke up the day after the detox wieghing 135 and feeling weak and bloated.
And why did this happen?signed lost
Loved it.
I lost 10 lb.
Nothing in the book to explain what to do.
I was so surprized that I felt so good on the fast.
I was never hugery or did not have a headache--it was wonderful.
I drank all the water and the juice --I did everything by the book --had the flax seed with the juice.
Did the fat flush diet easily and saw it work on me.
I assume Im constipated and these are the results but what else can I do.

Everyone else thought that she was hallucinating but she was really having the best time of her life.
Cherie actually wrote this book after finding an one-paged story that a girl wrote about zebras.
Becky didn't have to think about needles, sicknesses, or shots while she was in the Z'bras world.
Becky was all alone and frightened.
She was very scared while she was in the hospital receiving chemotherapy.
Becky found out early in the story that she had gotten a cancer called, Leukemia.
The happy side was that she was finally going home.The author, Cherie Bennett, was very thoughtful in this book.
Becky played games with the Z'bras and just relived her life with them.
Then, the Z'bras started showing Becky their own world.
Thanks Cherie for thinking of others.
Sadly, in the end of the story, Becky died.
Zink was a book that very well touched my insides.
It was like those horrible things didn't even exist.
Sadly, this girl died from cancer too.
She thought about others.

The game is fun & at the price this game is, I'd recommend it.
A few years later, out comes Fable 2.
As far as overall game play & story line, this sequel was much fun.
The first Fable game was fun.
I had no problems as far as that subject goes.
You level up as you progress through the game.
Graphics were beautifulMy only issue??
Just don't be surprised if you come out a little disappointed at the end.
The Final Battle.
It showed great potential for a franchise series.
Skills & magic improve the more you play.
If you remember the first Fable, the final boss battle with Jack of Spades was epic.
In Fable 2, well... At first, I thought I didn't do something.
After playing again I thought "That's It!!?
".I would've gave this review 5 stars if it wasn't for the final battle.

I doubt I will watch it a second time.
The movie basically fell flat for me.
She had no spark.
I read the book prior to seeing the movie.
As for the turning of Anakin to the Dark Side, it was only slightly hit upon what his internal war was.
My husband and I were confused at first thinking they substituted Natalie Portman with another actress.
Not sure why.
Not just conversations but entire scenes.
This is the only reason he turned?"
Padame's role was pretty usless in the movie.
She looked a little different and her voice seemed odd at first.
If you want the full story, read the book.
It was like half the conversations were completely left out.
It wasn't just Padame and if I hadn't read the book I would have been like, "This is it?
I found the movie too rushed and scenes left me wanting more.
Regardless though, you have to watch it once just for the closure.

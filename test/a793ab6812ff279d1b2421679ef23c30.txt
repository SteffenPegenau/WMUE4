So if you are traveling, and use the straightner just before heading out, then you need to wait for atleast 10-15 minutes before packing this.Having said both pros and cons, I really love it.
Right now, I have held them together by a rubber band (and it works just fine).
The comb is detachable.
It comes along with a comb which is very comfortable.2.
Auto power off.
And believe me, it works well for guys too!
The plastic handle is flimsy.
It actually takes more time to cool down (approx 15-20 minutes).
Gets hot quickly.5.
I always tend to forget switching it off, and it shuts off automatically.
No worries.3.
I just take it out and wash it regularly.Cons:1.
The screw is already screwed up in my piece (after nearly 3 months of use).
I used to travel with this a lot though.2.
Each handle is made of 2 pieces held together by a screw.
And more importantly, I am a guy with not-so-long hair.Pros:1.
I bought this 8-9 months back, and its amazing.
Comfortable grip4.

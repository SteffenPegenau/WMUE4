How did these magnificent actors align to work in such a bad, bad movie?
This film has such a really excellent cast.
Maybe seeing JESSICA BEIL POLE DANCING AND TOPLESS (not unimpressive on both counts, admittedly) is what drives these many positive reviews.
So because the acting was good, this product gets 2 stars.
I mean, really bad.
But, the content was TERRIBLE.
After watching this movie, I wondered why I bought it.
And the quality of the acting, by everyone, was great.
THIS MOVIE IS REALLY LACKING.
Two stars for I don't like it.
One star is I hate it.
Most of them were really good.
Not as bad as Southland, but really bad, none the less.
So, I went back to read the reviews.
So, my curiosity was piqued--that's why I bought it.
The rest were really bad.
But wow, really bad.
So many actors that I really like.

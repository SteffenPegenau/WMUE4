no CD can top this until underOATH releases a new album
ok everybody who is reading this and is skeptical.
ex.
Screamo music is made because of extreme passion for the message of the band.
i mean, look, how many other bands are out there that are Christian and harder that underOATH?
In underOATH's case theyre message is Christ.
give underOATH a chance and by this CD.
they must not know what theyre talking about.
c'mon ppl.
Music is about emotion, not sound.
this is best CD in all of the world.
Mortal Treason, Norma Jean, Zao, Haste the Day, The Chariot, and blessed by a broken heart.
like a million.
A Christian band can be whatever kind of music they want to be as long as the message is God.
dont listen to the person below me.
nobody should hate on Underoath for screaming and being Christian.

It's as if Petty needed to record to make some money.
Jeff Lynne's contribution is as expected.
Some of the riffs are similar.
I guess there's nothing wrong with that.
I bought both.
Many of the songs are very similar to earlier releases.
I love Petty.
There's not much here though.
This is rehashed music.
To me, the last two releases have fallen a bit short.
Unfortunately
He puts in the fillers and keeps the songs linked together.
The production of Jeff Lynne had me anticipating greatness.
Couldn't resist ever buying a Petty release.
But, it's more of a different version of an earlier song.
But, there is no greatness here.

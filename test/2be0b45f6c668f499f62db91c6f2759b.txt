Some years ago, I discovered these and found that just a single dot could cover my bruised and bleeding finger, to allow me to continue to work.
Now, these will also quickly peel away from curvature of my finger.
I went through one.
***Five adhesive dots*** in one afternoon of sewing.
So good, that on occasion, the callous on my finger will actually split, and allow a the tip of some of the smaller needles to actually penetrate my skin, causing pain and untold cursing.
I have tried their "adhesive thimble" but the shape and thickness caused the adhesive to give out and it would lift and peel off of my finger.
Four.
Ok.
Two.
Just buy some bandaids along with them.
Well, kind of.
I know my way around a needle.
I finally got so desperate that I covered the dot with a bandaid to keep it on my finger.Do they work?
Three.
These worked better by far.But, I think they have changed the materials.

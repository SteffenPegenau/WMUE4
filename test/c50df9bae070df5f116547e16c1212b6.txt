The cooling fan should be on the side.
Poor design.
And with Dell you have to get their type of plug.
This is the second adapter I have had to buy for $60.
So they've got me.
I will have to get another if it breaks again which I'm sure it will if I use it for a year.
I won't get another Dell computer.
I wish it were sturdier.
I have to prop it up with a pencil or something on the side.
And theres no volume adjuster on the computer.
Very annoying if you have to turn the volume down quickly theres no quick way around it.
The cooling fan is under the computer so it always overheats and shuts itself off.
YOu have to adjust by opening the volume window in windows.
Be very careful folding it at all if you take it places.
The wire inside the cord eventually wears and breaks.

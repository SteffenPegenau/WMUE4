NO!

But the director's cut needs to get its you know what kicked by the official version.
Here are the reasons you should see the offical version instead of the director's cut (spoilers ahead):1.They made Deckerd a replicant in this version.
2.They cut the happy ending.
I mean come on...Ridley Scott thought that was a good thing?
Blade Runner one of the greatist sci-fi movies ever made has been disgraced!
Now you don't have anyone to cheer for.
Are thay in the directors cut?
It kicked major.....you know what.

It does set me back to zero, so I just shut off.
Doesn't happen too often.
I just open the case, and reinsert the same battery.
Like I say, if its [price], the quirks are quite livable!
I received my Rio 600 for [price] (a refurbished one) when I signed up for a years [store].
Two major complaints.
Wish I had a cassette player in my car!
The foldup headphones look good, but hurt my ears.
My Rio does not restart every time I shut it off.
Voila!
For back and forth to work, its great.
Secondly, the single AA battery compartment is shabby.
I use it exclusively for [store] books.
Mine came with the adapter, but I only have a CD player.
Setting a bookmark though proved to not work.
Occasionally the Rio won't turn on, although I get no low battery warning.
The battery lasts about 6 hours, which is good for me.
It resumes from where I was.
I'd prefer something softer.
It holds about 6 hours at a time.

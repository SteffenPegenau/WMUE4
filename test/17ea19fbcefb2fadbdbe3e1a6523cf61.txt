Then I bought Deception point.
After that I read Da Vinci Code.
But lots of things were kind of predictable.
I read through it.
It was quite a good book.
I would still give it 4 stars.
I first read Angels and Demons.
Last minute saves, things fall into place for the hero and the heroine.
If you are a Dan Brown fan, i recommend you start reading the book without any expectations.I tend to believe that if this is your first Dan Brown book, you will enjoy the ride.
I still give it 2 stars out of respect to Dan Brown for doing an excellent job on the other three.
All the typical stuff.
I found it to be too predictable and too Dan "Browny".
Same old stuff.
Then I read Digital Fortress and I wanted to start working for the NSA.
I could not have loved a book more!

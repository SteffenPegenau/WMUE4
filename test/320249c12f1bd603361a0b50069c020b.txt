It was about Spencer Northcutt (Antonio Sabato, Jr.) and the vendetta that had ruled his life.
I would only advise renting this if you're a big fan of one of the actors.
I love creature features, and I love horror, but I don't like drama that pretends to be something it's not.
(Well, and there was no lower option.)
But that was all they had in common.
Not the same company, the exact same people.
Basically, it was like a bad soap.
Chaos ensues.
This has the typical underwater movie plot.
First imagine my shock to find out that they are made by the same people.
This movie actually had great graphics as far as the megalodon shark was concerned.
This movie gets one star because of Grand L. Bush's t-shirt.
It was for the most part believable.
Animal of immense proportions lives relatively undiscovered in the sea.
Only one person believes.
The problem was that the story wasn't about the shark.
I rented this one along with Dean Cain's 'Dark Descent'.

Warlords was probably the worst designed game on the disk.
Save your money...they didn't get it right.
Also, the playing field and objects were SO small, especially Asteriods.
My friend said that the ORIGINAL Atari system had better graphics than this disk.
First of all, let me say that I LOVE these games.
That's pretty bad!
All the others gave my friend and I a headache.
It's really the only game worth playing on the whole disk.
I wasn't expecting "Final Fantasy like" graphics by any means, but I did expect to be able to read the on-screen type (score, instructions, etc.)
I got right in front of the T.V., and I still couldn't read it.
In fact, I grew up on them.
I couldn't even tell what was happening on the screen.
You can see this one fine, and read the type.
That being said, I was VERY disappointed in this disk.
I couldn't even see what I was doing (even with the cabinet graphics turned off).
The best designed game on the disk, by far is Centipede (my favorite).

I got the timer, took it out of its box, and put it on the fridge.
If you want to use it, you have to hold it in your hand.The other frustrating thing...It only times 100 minutes.
*****Final Thoughts*****Find another timer.
First, the magnet is intolerably weak.
Pretty much that's the story.
!I have been using it for about 2 months now, and it has some interesting occurances.
As soon as I touched a button(not even hard enough to set a number) it came crashing off the fridge.
Fine.
It's easy to set.
Then I used it.
But if you want to time your roast while its in the oven, it sure would be nice to have more time.
This timer keeps time just fine.
This one keeps time fine, but if you are going to invest in a digital timer, get one that keeps at least 10 hours.If you are going to buy a magnetic one, I suggest that you see it in person first to find out whether it sticks well.
That's fine if you're making cookies or a cake.
And it is thoroughly FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!!!!

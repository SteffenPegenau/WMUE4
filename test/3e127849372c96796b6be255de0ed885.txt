Ralph climbed the telephone cord and hopped on the motorcycle.
Then he finds an aspirin under the dresser.
He lands in the trashcan where Keith finds him.
I've read all three stories of Ralph, and I think this is the best one yet!
When Keith is leaving, Matt brings the motorcycle back!
He could only move it with his feet.
He hides the motorcycle under the TV set.
He lets Ralph ride the motorcycle until he lost it in a hamper of linen.
Keith says Ralph can keep it!
The name was The Mouse and the Motorcycle.
Then Keith gets sick, so Ralph finds his way to the Ground Floor.
I think this is a great book.(...)
It all started when Keith left his motorcycle on the bedside table.
The only thing Ralph could do was ride off the edge.
I just finished a great Beverly Cleary book!
I give it 5 stars!
Then suddenly the telephone rang!

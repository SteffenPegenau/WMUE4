All of a sudden no picture, just audio.
That's why I bought another Toshiba.This VCR was a lemon for me.
I have an older Toshiba that still works great.
They told me they replaced the board.
To make a long story short, this is the 3rd time it's been in the repair shop.
The repair shop STILL has it from the 3rd trip in March of this year.
The VCR worked for about 3 weeks.
My first mistake.
Now I'm back waiting with Toshiba to get a new VCR.
I read the customer reviews, most weren't good, but I purchased anyways.Even more reason to read the reviews.Save your money and possible headaches on this one folks.
I bought this VCR...through Amazon.com....There is not an extended warranty offered.
Toshiba was very nice at first, now I'm left hanging by the manufacturer.
Sounds bad.
I went to the Toshiba site and found a repair shop that Toshiba recommends.
When it worked, it was great.
The repair shop tried to pawn a used one off on me.
I loved everything about it.

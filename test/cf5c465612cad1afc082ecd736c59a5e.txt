The bottom, they need more room in the thigh and rump area.
The bottom looks very small when you hold it up, especially to be called a 2-3x.
I have plenty of room to spare in here, and even sitting here typing I'm sweating a bit.The bottom is a different story.
I just bought this vinyl suit, and I must say I am a tad bit disappointed in the size.The top is perfect.
I bought this big on purpose.
I wear a 1-2x in clothing, and I'm wearing the top right now.
My weight is very evenly distributed, and I'm not bottom-heavy or anything.
The top is wonderful.
I tried it on, and couldn't get it past my thighs.
The bottom, sized all wrong.
However, the full set doesn't fit properly.The vinyl does seem very sturdy, like you can at least wear it about eight-plus times with care.
When taking the top out of the box you can see it's very big and roomy.
I figured it would last a little longer if I got it bigger.
I really wish the bottom was bigger.
But it looks like I'll wear just the top.

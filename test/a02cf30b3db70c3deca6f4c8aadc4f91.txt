Remove from heat and add the Golden Curry (cut it into pieces for easier melting).
Mix well and it's soooooo tasty!
HA!
5 servings?
1 lb.
Brown the onion and chicken.
I have been a fan of S&B Golden Curry since I found a box in SF's Japantown.
So disregard the printed directions and use my recipe instead!
Serve over rice or udon noodles.
Then I found it in the U.S. and realized that the instructions he gave me were not at all a translation, but they are better than what's printed on the box.
3 servings for people with normal appetites.
I wasn't able to read the preparation instructions since they were in Japanese, so I had a friend translate for me.
Add 3-4 cups of water and the potatoes and carrots.
chicken, 1 large onion, 3 medium potatoes (peeled), 2 carrots (peeled).
Cut all the preceding into medium-sized pieces.
Cook for 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are done.

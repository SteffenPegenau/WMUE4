I found her writing subpar.
I GET IT.
The good thing about this book is that it showed me that if Ms. Zalickas can get published, I can probably get published one day.
Yeah yeah yeah.
At times, I felt like I was reading half of a college essay and half of a novel.
"I got drunk because I hated myself.
I kept waiting for something to happen.
Ummmm....join the club.
She also goes on these diatribes about drinking and masculinity/femininity that are these random generalizations.
It has a juicy title, but it is not too interesting of a read.
She also repeats herself over and over and over again.
She gets drunk in college.
She gets drunk in high school.
Nothing really did.
I got drunk because I couldn't be close to someone."
Granted, her drinking is excessive but she really doesn't have anything creative to say about it.

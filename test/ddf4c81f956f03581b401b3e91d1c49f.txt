Storage underneath is a great idea but we have never used it.
Love the extra pockets on the sides.
The bars do not want to lock!
Wanted to return it but couldn't get it to fit back into the shipping box.
We have taken it down on three separate occasions.
Each time it has taken 15-20minutes to set up again.
The size is great, not too large and clunky.
Bought this bassinet because description states it can be converted into a playpen.
We travel a lot and thought it would be great for that.
Overall not really worth it for us.
As other reviewers have said, this thing is a pain, at best, to set up and take down.
Should have just gone with a pack n play.
These are great for holding diapers and wipes for middle of the night changings.
You must sit on the floor to access it.
This is not the case!
Also not the case.

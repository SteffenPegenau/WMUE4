I was disappointed.
Is it true?
and have been able to find value in most of these.
How do you react when you think that thought?
The four questions are presented with the self important phrase "the work".
However, they failed to even meet this minimal standard.
4. Who would you be without that thought?.
However, these tapes are weird.
Gestalt, EST, Hypnosis, etc.
I can imagine a simple discipline consistently applied could be worthwhile, but I don't see this as the one.
Here are the four questions: 1.
2.
The book got some good reviews, you might check out those reviews to make up your own mind.
The basic idea: that expecting that things should be different and feeling badly about this isn't going to help an individual is straight forward enough.
3.
I expected more, but if the only thing these tapes had done was reinforced this idea in a memorable way, they might interesting enough.
Can you absolutely know that it's true?
I've participated in all kinds of new age kind of stuff.

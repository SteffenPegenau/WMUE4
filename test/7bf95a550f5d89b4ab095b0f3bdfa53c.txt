First off, I'm a picture whore.
Spending money on 4 AAA batteries is not worth it.I had this camera for quite awhile though like 7 years about.
The display screen is black, which means the lenses was stuck (not open) I tried everything.
Now it's junk now.
Although, at the same time, kind of happy, plan on getting a new & better one.
The lenses screwed up on me.
Turn it on.
I take pictures crazy with this digital camera.
I'm upset a bit, because I love taking pictures & don't have a digital camera to take pictures with it.
Hit it gently against the desk & all, no luck.
This was a gift from my parents.
I try turning it on, but it doesn't go on, but goes off.
I put fresh batteries in or they are still good.
Last month ago, it decide to screw up on me.
Get rechargeable batteries as well too.
The lenses opens up, but closes up.
You have to click on button to turn it on over & over again at times.2.
It's alright for picture quality.HOWEVER, after awhile it just makes me pissed.1.

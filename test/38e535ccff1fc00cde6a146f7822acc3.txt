My son was going through a trash truck obession phase like most little guys.
After a few months it started falling apart.
I may have even cried.
Sadly, it's in the trash...ironic for a trash truck, huh?
He was too little to put it together with me, he was three, so good-'ol mom put it together for him and presented it that way to him for Christmas.
The pre- drilled holes were off.
The screws seemed wrong for the set.
not to mention this thing was a real B to put together, and I like to put things together.
Hes a very careful child and unlike my other two takes care of his stuff.
The quality just wasn't here.
So I bought this.
I'm talking screws coming loose...not just mine.
Not happy with it and I wanted it to be good so badly.
Dumb.He loved it.
The cab just fell off and after many attempts and a smattering of curse words it refused to stay together.

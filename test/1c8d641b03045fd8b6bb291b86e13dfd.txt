I'm looking forward to a cd with more original material.
Why start a new label and re-record songs that were on your old label.
Then the cd might have been great.
The Temptations has always been my all time favorite group.
However, this cd is a big disappointment.
What would have been great.
If Smokey Robinson would have produced a few songs.
I just can't seem to get used to the new lead singer in "GC CAMRERON".
The group is always a pleasure to listen too though.
There's nothing new to the arrangements that we haven't already heard before.
Now, this cd is the first for the label new door.
Or Norman Whitfield and or even Stevie Wonder.
Don't get me wrong he's a good singer.
He's just not as strong a lead as the singers in the past.
The material is classic motown.
Vocally the group is in fine form.
There's a few bright spots.

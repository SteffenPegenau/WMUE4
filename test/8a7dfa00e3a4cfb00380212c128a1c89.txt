They charged me 10.00 to post it to me and the stamp said 6.85.So I paid 45.00.

I finally received the H.B.
I understand wanting to make a little on it ofcourse.
I know who I won't be dealing with in the future.
So for the product inside the box it looks ok but thehair is different than the one they showed in the picture.
But you nearly got double.
Even 3 bucks on the postage of all things.
If you add 19.99 and 6.85 rounded off is 27.
I got it for my sister's 70th birthday.
barbie doll.
Can't explain thatexcept stealing.
Her name is Barbi and I periodically get her one for her birthday.
Not that bad except the fact I paid 35.00 for it.
This was the year to get her a special one.
I found this oneonline and when I received it today the outside box was in great condition but the box that barbie is in was smashed a little and the price on the front said 19.99.

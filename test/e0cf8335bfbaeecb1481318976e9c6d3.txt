So people started to crowded the trailer.
In the trailer was an 15-year old boy named Zackary Beaver, which is also the fattest kid in the world.
Nothing much ever happened in Antler, Texas until today.
They paid 2 dollars to see him.
There was a trailer that came from nowhere.
Later Toby and Cal were talking to Zackary.
They took him to the movies as friends.
So they wanted to see want he looks like.
At the end Zackary left, with the best friends he ever had.
When Zackary had to leave Toby wanted to give him a gift.
People started to wonder why they were there for.
When they met him he was rude.
Then later they turned out being friends.
There was a boy named Toby Wilson, with his friend Cal.
This took place at Antler, Texas.
Toby's mother was in Nashville trying out for a contest for country music.
The gift was to get him baptize, since he never went to church, nor did get baptize.
Days past the trailer was still there.

PLEASE !.........
Unfortunately this CD doesn't give the seeker of those jams what they are after.
They jam out on their songs like you can't even imagine!
Some of the best gutar solo's I have ever seen come from Jock Bartly.
They are the most phenominal band to see live.
I am a big Firefall fan.
PLEASE GUYS !!

I am also spoiled rotten that they are local in the Denver area, and I get to see them regularly in small pubs.
Give us one of those Little Bear or Patrick's Pub shows on a CD.....
Who knows if it will ever come.
But!!!
They are amazing!
Quite often The Little Bear in Evergreen.
See them LIVE !
What kills me is this.....
I have even mentioned that to the band after their small venue shows......and they agree there is nothing out there that we all are seeking.

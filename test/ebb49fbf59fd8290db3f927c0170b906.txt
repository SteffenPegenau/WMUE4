I personally don't see why so many people are down on Season 2.
Did they need to bring in Maya and Alejandro?
YES.
NO.
YES!If you're not sure about it, rent it first.
He's getting very tired/old/annoying (Time for a new villain, folks).
Season 1 was almost perfect.With regard to the writer's strike, I'm sure that took a toll on everything--rushed productions, rushed story-arcs, etc.
Dumb, dumb characters.
Should they have killed of Sylar?
I came to it with very low expectations, based on all the reviews here.
That said, there are some criticisms...Could it have been done better?
Probably.
Especially Alejandro.The main issue is this: Is this show still better than 80% of the other stuff on TV?
I wasn't disappointed (much).
I eagerly await Season 3!
It certainly isn't up to the bar of Season 1, but what is?
But I still like this season.
Surprisingly, I was very pleased with it.
I lost patience and purchased a copy this weekend.
I give it the benefit of the doubt on that front.

No radio edit jumbo!
The extended ones!
What I love most about the culb mixes is that they have samples fromt he 70's hit "If You Should Ever Be Lonely".
And if you watch tv a lot like me, then you had to see the fly video to this great remix.
The second track is the remix with major rappers , Da Brat and Missy Elliot.
They are the club remixes.
It has a lot of soul and hip-hop on it.
And Jay-Z's rap makes it even better.
The first track on the single is the album version.
Heartbreaker is a great, upbeat song.
All of them are really orginal and showcase Mariah's original, beautiful voice.
The remixes are so amazing!
So you get a great 70's song combined with the best 90's song (Heartbreaker, ofcourse!)
The final three tracks are my favorite.
And trust me, you 'll be so glad you did.
If I were you, i'd get the maxi-single right away, cause they won't make them for long.
This has got ot be Mariah Carey's best single ever!

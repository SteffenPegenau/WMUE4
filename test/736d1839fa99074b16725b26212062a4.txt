It's My Party is a band that sings and plays songs (both tasty covers and many originals) in the "girl group" style, just like thousands of bands yearning to sound like the Kingsmen reproduce that sound.
If you think they might be just a studio concoction, take my advice and RUN .

everything to get that sound!
The band comes with horns, vibes .
.
Wait a minute!

This band captures the feel of the genre with their original songs, containing arrangements to satisfy any purist.
Check it out!
This is not an "oldies" group.
Their praises have been sung by members of veteran girl groups like the Cookies, Toys, Jaynetts, Fashions, Shangri-Las and Raindrops!

I'm telling you that you're correct!
don't walk to hear them live!
You won't believe your ears when listening to this Rochester, NY based band.

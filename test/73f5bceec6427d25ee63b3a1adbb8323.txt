The GLs are timeless.
No, the heros are not linked, but the villian IS linked to the three heros.
I don't feel like an idiot because I missed something of the past or of other issues.
But there's more than the three Green Lanterns, there are a bunch of cameo appearances from JSA, Teddy Roosevelt, etc.
The fight scenes are nicely done.
All Lanterns are modest, heroic , and very reader friendly.
In all, this something I hope DC continues to produce.
I loved the short self contained stories.
Hey, DC is sure treating Green Lantern with RESPECT!
It's easy to be a fan right away!
I always LOVED Green Lantern and writer Ron Marz showed me why.
It'll be shame to buy this in Softcover for the hardcover is much easier to maintain for a long time.
Not Alex Ross great, but it is close.
The price is well worth it.
And finally, the art is just wonderful.
The story won't be altered no matter what the current comics do.
This Hardcover is beautifully drawn and all three stories are linked.

The album starts with some songs that are ok, but not great.
Mother Dear(7/10)4.
Midnight Ride(8/10)6.
Light Up(7/10)2.
Lonely Child(9/10)5.
Born For Adventure(10/10)7.
Lorelei(7/10)3.
This is a good album, the best album of Styx until Crystal Ball.
Prelude 12 (short instrumental song, I'm not gonna rate it)8.
See how i rate the songs, and you will see what I mean:1.
These albums are even much better then this one!
These songs are: Light Up, Lorelei and Mother Dear.
After these songs it's time for the real gems!
After this album that came out in 1975, the albums will only get better with Crystal Ball(1976), The Grand Illusion(1977) and Pieces of Eight(1978)!
Sweet Madame Blue(10/10)As you can see, this album is good.

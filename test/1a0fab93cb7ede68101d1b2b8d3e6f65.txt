And Jet Black New Year; i'm speachless.
I have never seen them, but people that say they put on a amazing show and they are right.
I have been waiting for Five Stories Falling for a while so I was so stoked when i got it.
All four songs are absolutely amazing.
I went to Maui a few months back and bought Waiting.
COMPLETELY AMAZING!
It's so amazing!
They are played a little worse than the record (not a bad thing), which for me I like better; to have something different than the album.
I bought Full Collapse at that time.
It's got the classic Thursday sound except a little different, but it takes you on a journey.
I didnt really listen to it until the next day because i was busy with the live tracks, but thats honestly the only time in my life where i used the repeat function on my cd player.
I listened to it over and over again.
It's like 4 songs in one.
I am blown away.
I have been a huge Thursday fan for a year.

Topping it off with "Nod Your Head".
Back to Chaos!
I can't imagine putting it back in unless I use the track filter on my player.
Lifelong Macca fan.
I'll be putting it away as a keepsake.
Certainly not this one.
And, honestly, is that what the fans want?
Where is the maturity?
The lyrics and tunes are shallow and forced.
This is a grown man.
Listened once.
Yikes.
There are a few songs that I love, a few that were decent, and about half were absolutely unlistenable.
I'd been anticpating this album and was very disappointed.
His attempts to recapture an angry youth definitely did not succeed.
I love you Paul, but not this album.

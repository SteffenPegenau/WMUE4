Don't bother with this book.
You should have no problem finding them.
If you're reading this you're on the net.
You'll get more out of it.
Other than having a CD of some useful utilities don't bother.
I'm usually a fan of dummies books and have several on my bookshelf.
Everything on the CD you can get for free on the net.
In fact the robots described come straight from the Constructopedia that LEGO gives away free in every Mindstorms box.
There is nothing new in here that hasn't been covered in one of the many unofficial guides that dummies is shamefully trying to compete with.
But I drift away from the intent of this review.
Spend the $20 on some more LEGO's or one of the unofficial books.
If you have a Mindstorms kit you have a computer.
I'm also a huge fan of LEGO's.
I have to say that this book is dissapointing on so many levels.
In fact if you don't know how to find LEGO related websites on your own you shouldn't be fooling around with robots in the first place.

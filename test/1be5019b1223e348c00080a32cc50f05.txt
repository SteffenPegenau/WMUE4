So, regardless of what any other reviews say, move on to another iron.
Take this one off your maybe list.
That's like saying you should fix your TV by kicking it.
Do not buy this iron.
I could go on and on with even more details about how aweful this product is but I do not want the makers of this aweful product to waste any more of my time than they already have with this iron.
But the worse part, even when you shake it, it does not come back on.
And when you shake it, water flies everywhere.
The solution.
Not only is it the worst iron I've ever used, it's the worst product I've ever used.This iron stays on for maybe 10-15 seconds, then it shuts off and the light flashes red.The instuctions actually warn you this will happen.
"Shake it".
I've never taken the time to write a review about a product ever.
In short - DO NOT BUY THIS IRON.
Are you kidding me?
But I felt a duty to my fellow citizens to warn you about this iron.
Shake it?!

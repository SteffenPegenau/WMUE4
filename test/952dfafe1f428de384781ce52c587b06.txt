I took the time and went to see it and I have to admit I did not read the book but I saw the film and just sat in my chair and cheered.
.......... all those people who think it was bad, that it was not even close to the book!
The movie is excellent.
He is one of the most spectacular filmakers of all.
How they show the storms forming and how it combines to form "The Perfect Storm".
Go see it!
This movie starts off telling you about the characters and how they set off to their adventure.
I suggest you all have this film on video because I will myself get it when it releases in November.
The waves are so well done, and quite a tear-jerker for those who cry a lot.
Hello all.
What a movie.
Air Force One was a great one directed by him as well.
This movie is fantastic!
Wolfgang Peterson has yet done it again.
The special effects are out of this world.
I just wanted to say what an awesome movie this was.

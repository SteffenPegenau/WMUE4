I'm sorry, but I don't want to read about characters I don't care about or wish would just get a life.
If you like great characters, avoid this book.
A pedantic, self-absorbed writing style and a totally unsympathetic cast of characters.
I never would have figured that out!
I wanted to give this book less than one star, but that rating isn't available.
This was possibly one of the worst books I have ever read.
"He followed his legs to the window."
And the writing can be described in one word: UGH.
Stop thumping the thesaurus and just write in plain, unadorned English.
GASP!
Are you suggesting there is some other way to do this?
Please.
A pumpkin is ORANGE?
"She went over to the pumpkin with the knife and cut holes in the orange fruit."
Heck, just avoid this book.
If you really like the beauty of the English language, avoid this book.

No.
I can't wait for book 3!
(It always was).
It's God.
And the Tom/Mary in CWG2 was red hot.
If truth be known, many fellow congreationalists secretely yearn for the answers to the questions posed in CWG.I personally liked the books on tape series.
It's a must read for those asking questions that religion hasn't answered for them.
Even traditional religions should softly "hmmmm" when encountering many ideas delivered by Walsch's conversations.
This is not a difficult read but some concepts are hard to swallow - like Hitler went to Heaven.
Did Walsch "hear" God?
Ed Asner delivers his part of the "spoken word" with a rich and power presence.
When the student is ready the teacher will come.
Personally the idea of a non-existant Devil fit my philosophy pretty well.
Is it Walsch?
Who Cares.Many will have to lighten up to understand what this book is really trying to say.
Walsch delivers concepts that are eye opening and skin tingling.

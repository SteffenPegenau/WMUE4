It was not only mastered from a mono source but obviously noise reduction was applied to it removing all low frequencies.
Therefore it sounds flat and cold.Since the mentioned review was the only negtive one I thought that Rykodisc has corrected their problems with this CD.
But my recent purchase confirms the contrary.All those people who own the original stereo vinyl LP can be lucky.

When I have bought this CD at Rykodisc London in 1998 I was hardly disappointed about the quality of this issue.

All that the first reviewer has said about this CD I can confirm exept the missing track.
This CD is no real replacement for the LP.The correct listing of the tracks:1.

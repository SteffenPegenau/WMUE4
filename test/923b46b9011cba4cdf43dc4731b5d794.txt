AT FIRST I DID'NT LIKE ALL THE SONGS ON IT BUT THEN 3 YEARS LATER I GOT IT AGIAN AND HEARD ALL THE SONGS FOR A 2ND TIME AN GOT TOTAL HOOKED.THERE SONGS ARE EASY TO REMEMBER AN EASY TO SING.THEY STAY IN YOUR HEAD.
HE SAYS "THEY SUCK" BUT I THINK THEY RULE!
I CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT.AN CANT WAIT FOR THEIR 3RD NEW CD.
IT'S THE BEST.
MY FRIEND DOES'NT LIKE'EM BUT I DONT KNOW WHY.
SO BUY THE CD.LOVE IT.!!!!!!!!
WEEZER IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE BAND THERE IS.
ALMOST ALL THE SONGS ON IT ARE COOL.
AND "ONLY I DREAMS" I LOVE HOW THEY PUT IT IN THE END OF THE CD CUS IT REALLY FILLS AT THE WHOLE CD.
I BOUGHT THIS CD 3 YEARS AGO AND BROKE IT CUS IT WAS MESSED UP.
!
I DONT CARE TOO MUCH FOR "THE WORLD HAS TURNED AN LEFT ME HERE", CUS I THINK IT'S SAD AN THE REST OF THE CD IS HAPPY TO ME AN FUN.
!IF IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M SAYING STUFF THAT EVERY ONE ELES IS SAYING THEN THAT SHOULD TELL U SOME THING.
THAT WEEZER IS YHE BEST.
BUT MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE"THE SWEATER SONG","SAY IT AIN'T.

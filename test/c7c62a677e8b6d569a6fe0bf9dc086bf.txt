Any music done with a guitar.Miraslav is never anything but outstanding.
Take your money and go get some hot dogs and eat them.
No, not by a long long shot.
In fact don't bother with this DVD if your looking for good guitar playing.
He's no Ottmar leibert.
You will enjoy that a whole lot more.
Not half as good as Jan Akkerman.
I like experimental music.
In fact he is not half as good as anyone I can think of.
No matter what, no matter where.The close ups of Trilok sticking a bell in water to get "different" sounds was, well, less than inspiring.Terje is just not up to the standards of anyone I know of.
He's no Mike Stern.
I like guitar DVDS.
Not even close.
Is it new age??
I like avante guard music.
I don't have the slightest idea how he got so popular.
Is it jazz?
German experimentalist Fred ( uhm what's his last name).

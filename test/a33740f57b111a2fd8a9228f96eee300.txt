(End of spoiler!)
The book ended very suddenly.
The excitement level went up and down after the beginning.
Exciting, but boring at times.
Except for a few of them.
(The end was very exciting.)
(No offense.)
This book is pretty good.
But it had great impact on the excitement, so I can not call that a flaw.
(Spoiler alert!)
Okay, so this book is recommended.
The beginning was very boring, and it stayed that way until pretty far into the book.
(Even though I was about to a second ago.)
Check it out!
This book was very intense towards the end.
The kids are a little bit dumb.
That was a flaw that really bothered me.

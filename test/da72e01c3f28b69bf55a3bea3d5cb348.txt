It is so flimsy it can rip very easily.
How convenient is that?
Which really, all they do is send it via USPS, which takes forever.
The belt clip, how does it work?
But then they stick you with the outragious shipping and handling charge.
This is awesome.If they really wanted to screw you they'd give you two of 'em.
It attracts dirt on the sticky side which also scratches the player.
The clear cover for the screen?
This is supposed to protect my player not make it worse.
Yeah, sure.
Your thinking what is there to lose for $.99, right?
Thats a joke.
It doesn't come off once its attached?
When you get it, its all squished and dusty like somebody dragged it on the ground before sending it.
Finally, when you open it and put the rubber case on, be careful it doesn't scratch your player in the process from all the dirt and dust that is impossible to remove.

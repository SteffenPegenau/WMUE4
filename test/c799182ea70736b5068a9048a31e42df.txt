Now go buy the cd!
Words cannot describe how I feel when I listen to John Legend.
I feel like I know him.
He is an absolute gem.
!
Without a doubt, everyone should feel this good.
My Gifts to all I know this Christmas season...The "Get Lifted" cd.
I can say with great confidence that he will be a tremendous success, because I, along with hundreds of thousands of others will guarantee it!
Meeting him was just the icing on the huge delicious cake that he provided me during his performance.
He is humble, appreciative, and probably not yet aware of what he does to his audience.
I would have paid thousands, stood in line for months and given up sleep for years just to experience what I did.
I look forward to meeting him and talking with him again!
I have had the great fortune to see him twice in concert, once in L.A. and once in Seattle both concerts within a span of 6 days.
Literally.
He speaks to my soul.

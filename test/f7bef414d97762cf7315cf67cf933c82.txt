This music is timeless.
I love to put this album on and just let it run.
I wish todays artists would wake up.
When Mr. Pendergrass is hurting in a song, the listeneer is also hurting.
You can taste it.
Their music has no soul.
Teddy has such a beautiful voice and his lyrics come right from his heart and soul.
their music, and the quality of their music, came first.
This is a beautiful album.
Todays artists will put out any old piece of crap just for the money.
You can feel it.
And it's unfortunate.
These guys actually cared about their music FIRST.
They dont make music like this anymore.
Soul R&B from this era is totally different from what it is today.
The almighty dollar was nice, dont get me wrong, but for artists like Teddy Pendergras, Al Green, Marvin Gaye, Freddie Jackson, Jeffrey Osbourne, etc.
Teddy Pendergrass MEANT IT when sang a song.

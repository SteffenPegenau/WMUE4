I got home and started messing with it and was very disappointed after seeing how it worked.
Not a kid friendly toy at all.
The monatage of pictures for the babies are beautiful with lovely sounds and great graphics.
You have to press very hard to activate the screen.
The "touch screen" is not a touch screen.
The concept is great!
Morning and was excited about it.
I don't know why they don't have parents test these things out.
My vision impaired son loved it and liked the sounds it made.
I bought this from Tues.
But when you moved the toys on tot he next stage it was not back lit.
I paid 29.99 there so it was a good deal.
Like, so har, that you finger gets sore from pressing.
It only lit up and flashed which was annoying and it would wait for you to press the screen for a response.
But the follow through is way off.

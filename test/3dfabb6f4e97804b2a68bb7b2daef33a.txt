The Lotus and the Steel5.
Like “Red Dawn” with Omega Red, “Repo Man” which tells of his claws and time with Alpha Flight.
There are other episodes that are probably better for this DVD.
In "Out of the Past" Part one we see how Wolverine got his claws.
But technically the transfers to dvd look clean and crisp.
And “Old Soldiers” which is about his adventures in WWII with Captain America.
Out of the Past II3.
Out of the Past2.
The Final Decision (Bonus)Only 1 episode really has to do with Wolverine.
“Weapon X, Lies, and Videotape” tells of his time as Weapon X.
Nightcrawler4.
The rest is fluff.
In the third and fifth episode, Wolverine is just a regular X-men.
The X-men Animated Series is great and should be released as a BOX SET, not single discs.
This DVD is just a way the studio can make a quick buck because of the X-men 2 Movie hype.
First Off this DVD only has 5 episodes1.
But getting back to the DVD.
In "Lotus and the Steel" he goes back to a monastery in Japan.

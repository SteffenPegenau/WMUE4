Many people who come to see me want to be psychic too.
Everyone sees auras, they just don't realize where to concentrate their thinking.
Do the exercises in here.
I read auras for a living and have found a lot of other books on this subject are limited to a certain perspective only.
This book is inexpensive and a great tool.
It is a simple process really and as such should be presented that way.
They really work.
Ted Andrews clearly knows what he's talking about.
You owe it to yourself to try these things.
Well this book will help you do that.
If you've ever met someone you liked or didn't like instantly, you've made that decision based on an aura.
I have used them in workshops.
No misinformation here.
You will be a better judge of people if you develop these skills.
This book is a no-nonsense guide to get anyone started seeing auras themselves.

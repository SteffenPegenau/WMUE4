I just had my third child, I'm a stay at home mom and I exclusively breastfeed.
I had an Avent Isis manual pump with my first two, which I didn't like that well.
I love that it doesn't have a lot of parts.
I know that the Avent pump works great for a lot of people.
I love this pump!
So that's where I'm coming from writing this review.
When I take it apart to clean it I feel like everything is really getting clean because the parts it has are simple.
The initial quick pumping feature is nice, and so is the swivel handle.
It took me a long time to pump much milk.
in 15 minutes (my baby is currently 2 1/2 months old).
I just wasn't one of them.
I'm easily able to express 4-5 oz.
I am very satisfied with this pump!
This pump is easy to use and assemble!
I use my pump 1-3 times a week usually.

It will NOT empty your breast.
First of all it is loud.
I pumped & pumped & pumped & hardly got any milk.
I was losing my milk supply fast!!!!!!
That didn't work this motor is not powerful enough.
I called my lactation consultant & she had me pumping every 15 minutes to regain my milk supply.
Don't waste your money on this pump.
The more I pumped the less milk I got out.
It is very expensive.
This pump is terrible.
I gave it one star because that is the lowest you can give.
I ended up having so much milk left in my breasts they got painfuly engorged & then resulted in getting Mastitis.
It looks great but I can't say anything else positive about it.
I suggest renting a hospital grade pump.
It is much cheaper & will definately work.
I eventually had to rent a hospital grade breast pump that worked.
Second of all it is not at all powerful.
I really give it zero stars.

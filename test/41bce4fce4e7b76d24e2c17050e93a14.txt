It's driving me mad.
Does anyone understand that chapter?
You need to read this book several times to understand what to do.
Are there any pictures that would explain the numbers?
However, I found the chapter on random markets so difficult that I skip through it.
Yet.
I can't figure it out.
Too much jargon.
This has worked quite well.
When I see one move I quickly look up the others and see if the group is starting to move and has relative strength versus the S&P500 and then I enter my trade.
The tables in the back are invaluable in trading groups of stocks that move together.
Then this books starts to make more sense.
Particularly after you've lost money trading.
However what does that chapter on random markets mean?
I liked the early history in the book.

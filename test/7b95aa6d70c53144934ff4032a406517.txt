)wanted Kira to die and for Vandara herself take her land.
as she got older her mother got terribly sick and died.
Vandara (an evil lady that wants Kira dead.
The court decided for Vandara to take the land.As for Kira she did not die but has to fix the singers robe.
I would recomend this for 10 yrs.
!
Her name is Kira.
When she was a small tyke (a small kid)she started to weave.
She meets Annabella, Thomas and Matt also she sees her dad which se thoght was deadI kinda liked the book because it was like a mystery of life and I really like that.
The book I read was Gathering Blue.
and older.I give this book 3 stars!!
Also when she finally sees her dad when she thoght he was dead!?
Now Kira is alone.
I also didn't care for it because in some places all she talked about was weaving.
It was about a girl with a twisted leg.
along the way.

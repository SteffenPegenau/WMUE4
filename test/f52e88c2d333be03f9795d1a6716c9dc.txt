Will probably buy as a joke again.
Little hooker dolls.
As an adult with a strange sense of humor I can appreciate them.Whould I get them for my 8 yo?
Now how funny are these?
I bought her as a joke with a little outfit.
The little big had wings and funny little eyes.Just to funny.
I am impressed.
Nope.
What a crack up!
It appeales to my darker nature.
The dolls can sand by themselves and are nicely poseable.
Right down to her earings and painted toenails it is well made and a good product.
But I don't buy regular Bratz dolls either.That being said I can appreciate the details and durability of the product when I see them.
Well marketed and great designs.
Trim work on the clothing along with the small designs on the shirts are impressively done.

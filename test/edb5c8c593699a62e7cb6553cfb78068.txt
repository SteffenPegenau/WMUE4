Playing around with eerie sounds.
It's interesting, and maybe even fun if you're in the right mood or altered state, but I was expecting...music.
Okay, there are a couple of cuts that are actual music, and some of the sounds are interesting, but you're not missing anything there.
Experimental noodling.
The longest piece is an actual recording of frogs.
None of that damn-it's-hard-not-to-dance-in-my-cube music.
Most of this is not musical at all.
So I'm disappointed.
This is really for the Quintron fan who has everything else of his.
Just thought you oughta know what you're buying.
The cover encourages "Play on Halloween night!"
Bought Frog Tape thinking, "Cool, more of the same!"
I don't mean that in a judgmental way, I mean really: it's not music.
Loved Swamp Tech.
Not.
Sound effects.
I discovered Quintron recently.
But I still love Swamp Tech so much that I'm off to buy some other Quintron.

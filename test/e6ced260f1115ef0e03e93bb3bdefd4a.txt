Taddei will sind chills upon you as Scarpia.
She screams the entire part and just sounds UGLY!
This is the best version, NOT the Callas one.
If you want the BEST AND ONLY TOSCA GET THE KARAJAN VERSION WITH PRICE, TADDEI AND DI STAFANO!
Gobbi as Scarpia is very boring!
Karajan lets you hear every great note Puccini wrote without over doing it.
Do your self a favor and STAY AWAY from this recording of one of my favorite opera's.
I don't know why so many people like it.
Price sounds like a proud woman, and Di Stafano sounds incredible.
on this recording.
This is the WORST recording of Tosca you can buy!
The orchestra you can hardly enjoy.
I like Maria Callas, but this was not a role for her!
Di Stafano is o.k.
It has nothing.

The games themselves also have a very low budget "feel" to them.
Indeed, reviews bear this out.
Same thing!
Too, bad, the toy had potential to be a good learning tool.
The whole thing is junk.
Now, even the controllers do not work well.
I returned it two times.
This toy or company won awards I think.
What kind of a company would do that?
I remember when I bought this how angry I was that it did not come with a power adapter.
Then, the power button did not work.
I'm sure other parents had the same problem therefore.
Several years later, I just tried using it again for my younger children.
As a result, I decided I will never buy any vtech product again, phones included, and have not since.
I couldn't believe it!

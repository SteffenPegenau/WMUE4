If I were smart I could come up with some other words.Otherwise it works well.
Hello design team?
It seems useless.
Where is that coming from?
WTF
Is it getting on my food?I opened it up.
Those 2 customer images belong to this review.I have had this for a year, used it like 15 times.
Hello bad attitude towards screw-ups?Someone at Cuisinart must have known about this.
Now I see this rust seeping from inside the lid.
I like it.
It's not labeled on the Parts and Features section of user manual.
Hello quality control?
Maybe it's there to generate service requests.
So much so that I will go find the screw in a stainless version and repair it.Revised: Now what is that little thing even there for?
What?
This is disgusting.
Totally gross.
I'll try it without it and see.

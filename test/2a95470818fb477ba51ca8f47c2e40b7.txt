It's mixed horribly.
are disappointed.
And they sounded like that 10 years ago.
Come on Metallica, you are capable of so much more.
Those albums all sounded the same and yet they were completely different.
Basically, I, like so many others.
But with Metallica, we all expect something more.
If we were to hear them and someone told us that it was some new band, I think most people would like it better.
I still have faith that they will be great again...someday
Well, Meshuggah uses a mixing board.
I heard they were listening to a lot of Meshuggah so that's where their new sound comes from.
And Justice for All, Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning, these are all great!
Here's the problem with this CD.
Go listen to "Gods of Rapture" and be amazed that they sounded like Metallica could have now.
Basically, the songs on St. Anger aren't bad.

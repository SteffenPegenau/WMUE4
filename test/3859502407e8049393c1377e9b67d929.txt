I would say she did a good job at the transition.
She interviews a young child who can give a description of the shooter.
Very realistic.
Looking back, Yolanda Joe's last book, THis Just In was a preview of what was to come.
A few days later, the child disappears.
For this story, Georgia has these opportunities.
This was Yolanda Joe's attempt at the mystery genre under the name of Ardella Garland.
She also has the interest of the Det.
After a drive by shooting, reporter Georgia Barnett is at the scene.
Doug which helps her out a lot.Ms (Joe) Garland, did a good job in keeping the reader in suspense.
The City of Chicago is the setting.
The action was steady, exciting and at some parts funny.
Georgia works with the police, media and family to get the child returned before it is too lateBeing a reporter is half of being at the right place at the right time, and having the right connections.
The story had the same humor as her other works.
The city is in the midst of gang violence.

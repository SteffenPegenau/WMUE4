It has its moments-some of them wonderful-including some great effects for the time (and for Disney).
That's too much of a stretch for me!
This is a nice diversion for a couple of hours.
Neither are the extras for that matter.
I always enjoy Max Schell-a great actor.
Ok so THE BLACK HOLE is not STAR WARS, but it is still a decent flick if you are not in a particularly picky mood.
But so what.
I think some detractors need to loosen their belts a bit and just...r-e-l-a-x.
The DVD transfer is quite good and clean.
The dialog is a bit of a clunker, some of the jokes are terrible, but I've heard MUCH worse.
This film is meant to be a grand adventure.
The rest of the crew is (literally) expendable.
However, the sets for the film are fairly convincing and certainly fun.
The sound is nothing to brag about.
I'll never be able to believe Anthony Hopkins going into space.

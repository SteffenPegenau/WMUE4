Would it have killed them to include the real ending?
But come on.
I love Army of Darkness.
If you want to see it for the first time, get another edition.
Why should I buy this if I have to ALSO buy the real version to get the full effect?
For those who have seen it, I can tell you that the real ending is nowhere on the DVD, replaced by the "original" ending.
This one doesn't cut it.
Granted, the Audio commentary is great, which saves this disc from getting one star out of pure spite.
Or was this a cynical ploy to force us to buy two copies?
But they cut out the best part!
And when you see it, you will realize why they re-did it.
I waited in line for four hours to see Bruce Campbell's book signing.
No Bridget Fonda, no "Lady, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store."
He autographed my Army of Darkness t-shirt.
Theoretically, I should love this DVD.
Ridiculous.
If you are a hardcore AOD fan and want the commentary, buy this.

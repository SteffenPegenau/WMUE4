Has anybody ever heard of "one."
I mean, did they really need the lame intro?
Crush 'em is ok, but it is so cheesy.
And don't forget, this is the best song!!
The verse for Prince of Darkness is a slight variation on "Bad Seed."
I would have given it 3 stars, but Prince of Darkness is nothing but recycled MetallicA music.
The last two songs should be one track, not 2.
If only they could have taken a real risk....
That is the only reason I gave it 2 stars.
That is a great riff, but MetallicA plays it better.
Prince of Darkness is the best song on here.
I kept looking for Bon Jovi printed somewhere on the cd, but I couldn't find it.
This cd is a disaster.
Again, MetallicA played it better.
I was so pumped to get this cd.
What happened here?

Nice and long, and chock full of story.
Man, this was a good book.
It wasn't even the horror that made me love it so damn much.
I wish I could remember my childhood the way King obviously remembers his, but I still recognized the thoughts and games those kids played.
At the same time, I hate when I get a meaty thousand page book and it's full of hot air, like those Robert Jordan books.
Sometimes when I'm half asleep I almost remember and then it slips away.
Unlike a lot of wimps out there, I'm not afraid of a whole lot of pages.
I feel jipped if it's under three hundred.
this thing is an opus, man.
I feel the same way.
That last line almost made me, a grown man (and then some), cry.
This book filled my every requirement.
And that last line killed me.
About how in the early dawn he almost remembers his childhood and the kids he shared it with.
It was the kids he created and the adults they turned into.

So, watch where you vacuum, as we should anyway.
It is picking up everything I would expect it to.
I received the DC07 in two days.
It was easy for me to put together.
It only makes the terrible noise some talk about when I hit something that I should not vacuum: metal key ring, attached rug strand.
The process was very smooth.
I am very happy with my purchase, especially at the low price I paid.As far as Amazon- I ordered the DC07, the next day saw the DC14 at a lower price, called Amazon and said I wanted to order it.
(Some said it was difficult.)
Fed Ex picked up the other both in the same day.
It is not that hard to work with.
I received my DC14 in two days.
I almost did not buy the DC14 Full Kit after reading some of the reviews.
They said fine.
The wand...it is long, but it is not complicated.
But, I did.
The whole process took 4 days.

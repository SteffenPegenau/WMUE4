Unfortuntately, i missed the return window.The 4 months we used the busters cubes I noticed an improvement in my dogs behaviour.
So bought another one, but, then with the mini the same thing happened 2 months after using it.
They are great for my dog who is very hyper and all over the place at times.
Nothing seems to get either open.
After about 2 months the center piece stopped turning, on both of them!
He was getting fed 2x a day, so 60 uses and then it jams.
The first one, the large one, I thought it was just a fluke.
A one off, nothing to write home about.
I don't want to spend more money on getting another one for only 2 months of use.
I have a mini and large one.
It helps to keep him engaged and focused on one thing.
I have tried everything.
I love my buster cubes, when I get them opened!
I think this has helped long term.My issues: THEY WONT OPEN!!!
Soaking it in hot water, banging it while trying to twist it.

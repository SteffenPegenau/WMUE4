Is this CD Great?
And they come pretty damn close.
Drawing equally from The Cars and The Doors, The Strokes have come up with a nice little formula and stuck with it: Poor production, cheesy synth work and tight song structures that get right to the point and will always entertain, no matter how "manufactured" their sound is.
Are they talented?
You bet it is!
Probably not.
Hell no!
Are they better than Interpol?
Are they any more than your average, garden variety power pop band?
Not particularly.
No.
Are The Strokes the saviors of rock?
The production is shoddy, but it works.
Did they deserve all the acclaim their first album, Is This It, got?
Certainly Not.
While the strokes are terribly overrated, they strive to live up to their praise with their sophmore release.

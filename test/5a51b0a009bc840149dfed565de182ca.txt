Where do I write to get my money back?
I'm flabbergasted!
Plot?
You obviously need it.p.s.
I'm flummoxed!
Take a looooong vacation Tom.
That's fine, but someone should have slapped a sticker on the cover identifying it as "totally boring and moronic - a complete waste of time and money for the PC game enthusiast"
Oh my gosh, who wrote this trash?
I never thought I'd find a bad Clancy novel.
Character development?
What's that?
I've read the messages explaining that this novel is background material for the CD-ROM game.
Surely not Clancy!
Who will reimburse me for the 3 hrs I flushed down the toilet trying to find a plot?
This is what I would have written in 7th grade.
I'm incredulous!
Team USA scores again!
Now I've seen (read) everything.

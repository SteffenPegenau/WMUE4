DESPINA VANDI IS ONE MY FAVORITE GREEK SINGERS.
BECAUSE GOOD MUSIC IS GOOD MUSIC, NO MATTER WHERE IT'S FROM.
AND AS A GREEK AMERICAN THAT MAKES ME FEEL REALLY GOOD.
THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT KNOW NOTHING ABOUT GREEK MUSIC BUT RESPONDED TO "GIA" IS AMAZING.
NO.
C'MON, HOW MANY TIMES DOES "OPA OPA" HAVE TO BE REMADE?
BUT SHE'S A GOOD ENTERTAINER WITH A HANDFUL OF GREAT SONGS.
THAT SONG CAUGHT ON IN THE CLUBS AND RADIO IN AMERICA LIKE I NEVER EXPECTED.
NOTHING ON THIS RECORD WILL CAPTURE THE MAGIC THAT "GIA" DID, AS FAR AS THE USA MARKET IS CONCERNED.
THAT BEING SAID, I HAVE TO AGREE WITH ANOTHER REVIEWER...THIS COLLECTION OF SONGS WAS JUST THROWN TOGETHER FOR THE SAKE OF MAKING A QUICK BUCK.
SORRY VANDI, TOO LITTLE TOO LATE....
VANDI IS ALWAYS BEING ACCUSED OF RIPPING OFF ANNA VISSI.WELL, THIS IS ONE INSTANCE WHERE SHE SHOULD HAVE.
THE ENGLISH SONGS HERE ARE REHASHED AND RECYCLED.
"CALL ME" FROM ANNA VISSI IS THE #2 CLUB SONG IN AMERICA THIS WEEK.
IS SHE THE BEST?

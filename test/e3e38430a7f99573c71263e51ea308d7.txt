I don't think this is even worth reading.
She suddenly turned kind (am I missing something here?
This makes me SICK!
It's such immature writing.
I used the page number to my advantage, for I loved every single page that I read...
When I read Gone With The Wind, I just couldn't put it down.
But this!
Ha!)
It's written in what I call *1ST GRADE WRITING* yuck!
A. Ripley is mistreating the characters in this, writing simple words, not writing with the passionate love that Mitchell wrote with...
And early in the book, Rhett takes her dressed as the queen of hearts into his arms and laughs, when his mind is supposed to be set.
Scarlett isn't the selfish complicated woman that Gone With The Wind described, in Ripley's book, she's a heartsick wuss who needs Rhett's love and can't live without it.
Spoiled Scarlett O'Hara?
Kind!
I could write better than this.
It was so beautifully written, and I love books like that.

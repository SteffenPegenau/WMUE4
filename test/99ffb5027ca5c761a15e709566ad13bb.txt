Turkish Western 4.
So I wonder if the version being sold here has vocals (doubt it though).Also, my CD has the tracks in a slightly different order:1.
Why-Y 10.
Go-Go 3.
However my CD has a slightly different cover (it does not have the hebrew letters on the right hand side).
The Iraqis 5.
One song has the great highland bagpipe in it (Go-Go).Just FYI: This is an instrumental CD (no vocals), contrary to what the other reviewer said.
Zumzum 9.
Night Sail 7.
Some songs are jazzy (such as Why-Y), with a middle eastern feel.
Deror Yik'ra 2.
Oy Vey is very klezmer sounding.
Monkey's Paradise 8.
Oy Vey (Stoliner Nigun) 6.
Deep in the Sea
Deror Yik'ra and Zumzum have a very middle-eastern sound.
Good CD.

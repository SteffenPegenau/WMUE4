Have some friends over and see this.
The sounds.
This is one movie that you will remember awhile.
(ohhh)the shapes + eyes.
He is a big baby.
Them creepy lil people with freaky eyes who come out the back of yur head are gonna getcha!
He still doesnt know it was me to the day.
They are very different but both adaptions of Japanese horror films.
Right there in front of his girlfriend.
There are many creepy/haunting things.
I went around the back of our house and banged on the sliding glass door and he screamed.
I have seen this twice.
This was much better than the Ring 2.
I guess I am not as easily scared, but to some this will be nightmarish.
My brother was watching this with his girl friend.
!
(It was the part in the hallway where hes watching the tv screen) My mom came running down and my brother (16 yr old) was crying.

It is real shakey.
Also, when you push the stroller it isn't smooth.
I have been unhappy with everything.
When you try to open it is always rubs the ground and it is all scratched up.
The car seat is terrible.
Her head always leans forward.
I would never buy another Baby Trend Product.
I had to put a pool noodle under it to keep it level.
The straps aren't big enough and my baby is only 14 lbs.
It never seems to want to lock in the base.
I haven't had the stroller collapse yet but I am really worried about it.
The stroller is terrible to open and close.
It is way too heavy and the handle is awkward.
It is almost impossible to get the handle up and down.
If you get the incline right then the base collapses when you tighten it.
They always cut into her neck and they always get all twisted.
I have to say that the only thing I like about this travel system is the print.
The base is awful to install.
They are awful to adjust.

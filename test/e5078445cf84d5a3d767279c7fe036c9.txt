It would make a great mini-series, but for the life of me, I can't think of any stars that could do justice to Seth and Maggie.
Thank you, Ms. Hart!
This book is going to be big, I can tell.
Right down to the tiniest detail.
What a talent this writer has for description.
What a wonderful book.
I loved it!
All the raw emotions that I felt were incredible.
I felt as if I was in the room, experiencing what they were experiencing.
Ms. Hart has a gift for grabbing you and pulling you into the lives of the characters.
READ THIS BOOK!
I have never read a book with this plot line and it was a breath of fresh air.
Seth and Maggie are unique in the fact that they both overcome such obsticals throughout this novel.
The book is fastpaced, has a little intrigue and suspense, and, oh yes, the love scenes.
The love scenes were great.

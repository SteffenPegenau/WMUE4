The wife LOVED it though.
.
Somehow, they managed to turn a short story (as originally written) into a slow, plodding movie that drones on for about three hours.
good for them.
I understand that it was up for a bizillion awards and so on.
I bought this movie at my wifes urging.
By the way .
She told me about the concept (someone born old and getting younger over a lifetime and dying as a baby) and said, from the parts of the movie shes seen, she thought it was a wonderful movie.
I found it mind numbingly boring.
I think most guys would feel the same way I do about it - a real cure for insomnia.
Had it been only MY opinion, it would have gotten less than one (if that were possible).

.
I gave it 3 stars BECAUSE the wife loved it.
I thought the second dvd with the "how they did stuff" was FAR more interesting than the movie.

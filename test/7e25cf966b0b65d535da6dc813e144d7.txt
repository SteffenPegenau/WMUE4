She's still the baddest female of all time.
look back at her first five albums they were all unbelievable.
just do ur thing like before.
Also she's one of the best mcs to ever hold a mic.
what u did with no effort.
only lauryn comes close.
PEace girl.
if this is ur first lyte cd please dont judge her.
Unbelievable MC.
This album is not bad but not a good LYTE album.
Even the masters themselves pay tribute to her talent.
if LYTE can do what she was doing before, HIPHOP would change.
her first two were her best and definitely a true representation of her effort.
LYTE u are naturally gifted, as a big fan of urs just forget about competition because u won before it started.
she is legendary.
real good, exceptional.

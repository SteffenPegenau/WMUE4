They suck.
Also, nice Map Studio.Cons: Use of Formations.
You can't do everything in 3 days.
Dark Reign 2 is awesome game.
If you move someone in the middle of a group, they won't get out for 5 minutes.
These units are super slow.
JDA has the Guns, Sprawl has the Defensive.
On SP, there is in the readme a 'speed up' command.
Even after that, they are still not in full formation!
They have really outdone (and sucked) at this game.Pros: This game has a brand new engine, which can run as smooth as an Unreal Engine on one of those new Gigahertz PCs...Units are detailed up close and still appear detailed from far away (but aren't...nice) Units are well balenced.
Units Slows.
It speed my Guardians, to get from the bottom of the map to the top of the map, from taking 5 minutes, to taking 4 1/2 Minutes.Buy/Rent: BUY!
It hardly works.
You get 4 Formations, which they take 4 Minutes to get in a 5x5 Box Formation.
NEED FIX!
Group Ops.

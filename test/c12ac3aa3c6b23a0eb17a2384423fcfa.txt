ie.
However a lot of the material was not and did not have a chance to be on the exam.
the history of Windows and 8088.
I also studied peter nortons win 98 book and other books.
If you have not hands on you will have a tough time probably.STUDY HARD.
As others mentioned, know your windows3.1 and 95 well and know how to get around.
I thought the book was good and it gave some very good information realted to windows knowledge in general.
The hardware part was fair.
However in their defense it was relevant info for the big picture of computer knowledge.
It's not free.... Good luck...
Overall I studied much more than I needed to for the exam.
You can quickly bone up on a section you may not be clear on.
I liked how the topics were laid out.
The windows/dos part was more challenging.
For me hands on experience was a major factor in me passing/ 84 on both tests.

Mike Rutherford can sing.
I don't think that they need to bring Phil back per se... just have faith in themselves and do it.
Ray Wilson's vocals are so horible, why would anyone want to listen to this.
All I had to hear was the Wilson live version of "Turn It On Again" to turn it off and never turn it on ever again.
Tony Banks can sing.
I still don't.
I have not heard the entire album.
I am one of those that was a major Phil Collins fan, yet didn't feel that Phil Collins WAS Genesis.
Sorry.
Ok, well, I had been a Genesis fan since the 70's.
No wonder it was the demise of Genesis.
Until then, I can't bare to listen to this Wilson Genesis again.
Bring in someone from the Prog rock days maybe.
They don't have hard rock voices, but they can sing.
They didn't need Ray Wilson.

I can control the volume with the remote.
I can pause run into the store or whatever, and return to whatever I was listening to.
If you are thinking about buying this product then I would give it a try...
I've had XM.
The unit I have is pretty stable as far as defects and bugs I have seen in some of the reviews.
There isn't a better radio for this technology.
I can take the radio with me and listen to recorded material.
Now I can record stuff.
It is mounted and seems solid.
Just got my s50 and so far so good.
The s50 is excellent.
Its as if you have an aux jack plugged right into thier studio.
The s50 sits in the dock with confidence.
Mine came with 1.2 firmware upgrade.
I used to have a Sportster.
Howard sounds crystal clear.
Also if you listen to the s50 in a standalone configuration you will not believe the quality of the audio.
A lot of features that lacked in the Sportster I now have in the s50.

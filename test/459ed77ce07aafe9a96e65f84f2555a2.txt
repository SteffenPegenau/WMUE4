when monkey boy (goku in the real version) flies it looks soo fake!
and thats the dragonball main move!
but i WILL give credit for the actual stage fighting!
they showed they could actually fight, the fights dont look too fake.
yuk!
and TOO, they couldn't even get the damn names right!
the movie looks sooo fake!
they don't even go super sayjin!
they tried to mix in dragonball with dragonball z and turned out stupid.
and ALSO!
and would be worth about a penny to a dragon ball, dragonball z or dragonball gt fan.
they have SPIKED hair!
and goku used the magic cloud cuz he couldn't fly, and when he could fly, he didnt need the magic, the candy cloud anymore!
anyways... they didn't even do a KAMEHAMEHA!
and since when did sayjin's have CURLY hair?
so basically... this movie is WACK!
But if you are a dragonballz fan, like me this movie is STUPID!
this movie SUCKS!

did you see it?
The boyfriend just kinda shrugs it off.
IT WAS MY FAULT...
Did you see watch them rip her apart?SEE WATCH them rip her apart.
The acting is hilarious.
I had to rewind to make sure i wasn't hearing things, then i put on the subtitles.
NOTHINGAlthough my favorite part ever that me and my friend are now quoting non stop is the heartfelt scene where Curien is crying about how some lady died, he says (and i quote)She's dead, i didn't save her..
One of those corny ass flicks you can watch just to laugh at.
Was that REALLY their best take?
I love how there are zombies all over, and one guys girlfriend even turns into one and attacks him, then gets shot repeatedly.
I've seen some bad movies in my time, but man this one really takes the cake.
No emotion at all.
Were you here?
I can't believe this garbage was put in theatres.
Man this movie is horrible and that's what makes it great.

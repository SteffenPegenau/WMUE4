I use 2 TBSP of this whey protein in a blender with 6 oz of milk and 2 TBSP of a drink mix powder from Hills brothers called double mocha.
Love this cafe mocha!
My kids and I love these "icy mochas".......and they are healthy...not like the one's at paneras or McDonalds.
Can't say the same about my FIRST flavor,"Rich Chocolate".
Now I am encourage to try another flavor.
I was determined not to throw it away and get through my 5 lb container!
(I love chocolate and I thought it would be my safest bet.)
What is another good flavor to try?
I thought the flavor of rich chocolate was dreadful.
I add a handful of ice and blend until really creamy.
To my suprise, the mocha is really good.
On a scale of 1 to 10, I will give it a 9.
Many times I felt like I had to choke it down.
I don't know why, but I decided to give another flavor a try....but in a 2 lb size.
I have a trainer that loves this protein brand, so I thought I would give it a try.

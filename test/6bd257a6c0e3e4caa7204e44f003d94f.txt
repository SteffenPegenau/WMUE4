I sadly lost my only copy years ago and am not sure if it will work on this computer.
It was so much fun.
The games made it so much fun.
The problems with adding up food tabs, adding weight, etc., they come in handy.
It was a great way to spend my weekends.
I had trouble with Math.
What can I say?
I wish I could get another copy to work with Vista.

it covers everything from Area, Gas budget, decimals, division, and a a pie chart section too.

Using this helped to strengthen my ability to use quick, mental Math.

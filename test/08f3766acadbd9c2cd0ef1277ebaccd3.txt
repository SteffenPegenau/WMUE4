The brushes?
I see pictures now of dolls with these accessories and I know in my area, they are kind of "sold-out".
But - NO ACCESSORIES!
I bought this doll because I received Cali Girl, Summer's Horse as a birthday present.
I don't think the dolls necessarily need to coordinate to their specific horses.
(She had the stand included, though and a calendar).
I have vintage Dallas from 1979 and she looks very beautiful on him.
The hair is awesome, real ashy blond with realistic highlights, and she smells of sun tan oil!
Where's the bucket?
The doll rides very well.
The clothes are lovely, but I sure wish she would have had a brush, even for her hair!
This was my first Cali girl.
They did not have the Summer doll with a cowgirl hat and the Lea doll only wore sandals.
She is easy to pose and her cowgirl boots are awesome - cream color and tipped in brown, the cowgirl hat is super feminine sunshade.
Were there 2 editions?
The beach towel and canvas bag?

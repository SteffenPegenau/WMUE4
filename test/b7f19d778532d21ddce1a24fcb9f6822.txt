Zero character development.
The acting was horrible.
There was absolutely no suspense.
I cringed at the dialogue throughout this movie.
I wasn't and you won't be either.
Made the mistake of renting it on DVD and feel cheated out of $3.95 and the 2.5 hours of my life that I will never get back.
Rent Alien instead.
I can not get you far enough away from this movie.
No such luck.
You find yourself not caring about any of the characters and just hoping that they all die quickly to bring the movie to a swift end.
The delivery of lines was forced.
The transitions between scenes were a laugh.
I sat for 2+ hours waiting for something to get better or to realize that I was missing out on something.
The editing (or lack there of) was bad.
Morgan Freeman's performance in particular was ridiculous and over the top.
Skip this movie.

Conan in the comics did contemplate in peace, a sharp juxtaposition to the man's violent side.
Barbarian is one of my favorite Arnold movies.
Each scene Arnold would try his hardest to remember how he had gone through the scenes.
Even the best of fans should never own Conan the destroyer.
They were very light hearted and sounded like great friends.
I don't believe this is a good buy.
The juxtaposition is balanced in the extended edition.
The director discribed the undertones of the movie.
But it was a long time ago that he had done the movie.
They pointed out the things I idly let pass.
I loved following along with the director and Arnold in the commentary.
Even aside from all the trivia information, it was just fun listening to the two.
The extended edition of Barbarian includes deleted scenes, A digital remaster of the decaying original.
You get longer scenes of silence.
Buy conan the Barbarian, not this collection of the two.
Destroyer is a really bad movie.

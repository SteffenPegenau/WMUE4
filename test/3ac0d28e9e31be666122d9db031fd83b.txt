Cause you wont feel good about this.I gave this Dvd to my brother to take to argentina with him.
But live.
).I wish you all find this as a helping guide.Leandro.Miami Beach- Usa.
And he does a great job.
then, do not buy this Dvd.
Because the songs in the album sound great.
(so i will try to forget this bad experience, and keep listening to the CD which is great.
And i paid the 17 dollars.Kiedis, Singing live is really bad.
As in the album.
Singer sucks.The Guitar player is really good.
Buy it.If you like their last album.
Reason why i bought it.
He is really creative.
Flea, is a good musician.
I like the chilli peppers, And i particulary liked their last album "By the way".This Dvd is full of songs from By the way.
But his clown approach sometimes makes you take him less seriously.I will close this way.If you are a Blind fan of the chilli peppers.
And were sing great too.
He has no voice at all.It made me feel really bad.

Ms. Joy invites us to smile along with her as she takes a jab at Regency romance.
The best thing about this novel, for me, were the satirical elements.
I'm not a big romance reader, read mostly sf/fantasy.
I picked it up with no prior expectations.
I'll be checking for her books from now on.
Loads of clever, underlying sugestions.
I'd compare her most favourably with my favorite fantasy writers, Anne McCaffrey and Stephen R. Donaldson.
The story was crisp enough to keep me turning pages long after I should have been asleep.
The characters/role reversal grabbed me and kept me throughout.
Anyone who can come up with a popular dish called "tasteslikerooster" (in a female dominated society!)
This is a smart book.
I hadn't read this author before but she was reccommended to me by a few friends of mine.
She's a very good writer.
certainly gets my buck!
What a unique, clever book she has written!
Great sense of humor.
The sex scenes were no chopped liver either.

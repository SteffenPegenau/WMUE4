You're going to think about how many idiots didn't like Unbreakable and you loved it.
I GUESSED the end by the middle and that's bad in a regular movie - it is UNACCEPTABLE in an M. Night movie.
Bryce Dallas Howard gives a great performance.
Oh no!
Here are things I said all the way through:Are you kidding me?Please don't let that be the ending.That is the worst, quick wrap up in movie history.Um positive things: You get to look at the super hot Phoenix brother.
I wouldn't have believed me either.
So you're going to have to see this train wreck for yourself - I understand.
The Village is wretched.
You will not want to keep it.
I loved Unbreakable.
It really isn't the directing or the performances - it's that it is a stupid movie.But I know you're not going to trust me.
I loved The Sixth Sense.
Oh no!
I loved Signs.
How many folks that don't like Signs and you loved it.
Just one thing - do yourself a favor and rent this movie first.

Maybe it is die off and I am getting better but none of the other symptoms are better like the depression and headaches and tiredness.
I see absolutly NO results.
If you have any questions please ask, I will try to answer.
Actually out of 100% I am now 75% tired so 25% less tired.
Then 2 packets a day for a week and now three packets a day for the 3rd week.
I still want to die!
So basically I am going to give it ONE star for now since thats how I feel right now.
So thats my review so far!
I was not even going to write a review because as the title stands, I really do not know how it is.
Noone can really answer.
I started with one packet a day for a week.
I am using for vaginal yeast issues for the past 10 months straight!
I am so uncomfortable.
I will keep updating as we go.I have been on the threelac for the last 3 weeks.
I am torn between is this yeast die off or not working?

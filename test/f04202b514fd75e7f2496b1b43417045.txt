Where did he take Jeff to?
I give this film Three Stars and reserve the right to increase the Stars once I have seen it on DVD.A.
Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
I will need to buy the DVD and see it again to revisit this movie.
What was Ben's place?
Why was he screaming all of the time?
The cinematography, direction and Lynch's use of chiaroscuro so make this film worthy of seeing once, twice and thrice.
But it was Hopper's manic-depressive performance that really annoyed me.As I saw this on a video tape made from cable, I must say the video quality was a bit lacking.
Roger Ebert gave this film One Star.
At the same time, Blue Velvet, in my opinion is no way near a Five-Star film.
However, Dennis Hopper's over the top and melodramatic performance was a turn off.
Ebert's One Star review is too low.
Leonard Maltin gave it Two.
I give it Three Stars out of Five, because it was beautifully shot and quite original.
I know it wasn't a whorehouse with all of those old, fat women.

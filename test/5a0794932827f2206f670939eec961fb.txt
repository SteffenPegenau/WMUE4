Guess if you don't know the comic you'll find it likable.
Overall after paying for this I do not plan to get the second one.
There were jokes unfinished and for the most part really made me miss the comic.
I will offer this sentiment.
As a fan of the comic I found the visual translation for the most part excellent.
This added so much emotion and sometimes humor to the story.
He delivered his lines like Robocop...emotionless.
There was no grit in his voice.
It was just not enjoyable for me.
This is the only reason it gets an ok instead of dislike.
This not being included was such a huge miss.
There were some miscues and things that I just don't think they did correctly but it was for the most part accurate.
My son however did see it and not having a sense of the comics like it.
The other miss was Peter Weller.
In the comic they let you hear what the characters were thinking.
What ruined it for me in many ways was the lack of the third voice.

This CD is so cool!
What's My Age Again?- 10/106.
Here's a track listing, and next to the title, I put how good it is:1.
The Party Song- 10/1010.
Going Away To College- 10/105.
Adam's Song- 9/108.
Aliens Exist- 7/104.
Whenever I'm going on a long car drive, I listen to this over and over.
Wendy Clear- 9/1012.
This cd is my favorite that I own, and if you love Blink but are not allowed to get cds with "Explicit Content," you should get this!
Mutt- 9/1011.
Dysentary Gary- 10/107.
Oh, and enough of this bull about Blink being sellouts!
Don't Leave Me- 8/103.
Anthem- 9/10I don't skip any of the songs except for "All The Small Things" because I've heard it too much, and I'm getting tired of it.
All The Small Things- 6/109.
Dumpweed- 10/102.

no lead?!
!I can only hope that the reputation of these Gummy Vites continues to grow because it is well earned.
I am not a mom ranting about lead rumors, etc.3.
more, please.
I think they taste better than regular gummy bears.
I had to buy a bag of regular gummy bears to put next to my Gummy Vites because the first time I had these, I definitely ODed.
I am the queen of junk food, but at least I am getting my daily dosage of vitamins when I eat my gummy bears.
I'll confess that:1.
My peers agree.I think that this is the number 1 vitamin of all time.
COngratulations to everyone who made these happen, because the endeavor is ridiculously delicious.Good for you and good tasting?
I am no longer a child (per se)2.
I am a college student.4.
I try not to OD (that's overdose for you younger/older people) on these, but they're incredibly delicious.
They were just too good!
GOOD FOR YOU!?!?

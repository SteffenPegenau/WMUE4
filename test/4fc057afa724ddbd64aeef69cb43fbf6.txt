I just love it!!!
I bet if u get better ones, the sound would be even better.
Totally SATISFIED!!!
It's VERY SMALL...u can fit it ANYWHERE!
It gets a little bit scratched very easily..but who cares if the main function is accomplished??
;)
that's the BIGGEST CON!I RECCOMEND U BUY THIS!!!
Right?GREAT SOUND, very PORTABLE, Good capacity, FAST!THE PRODUCT is 5 stars...the software SONIC STAGE not so good.
The sound is great, the earbuds are ok!
Otherwise u need the stupid sonic stage!!!
!...i swear.
It is AWESOME!!
It's a little bit hard to figure it out at first, but once u get the hang of it's ok. WHAT TO DO?
Someone told me to download an MP3 File manager...it's supposed to install this software in the player, and then u can transfer files from any computer.
I agree with others about the NO CARRYING CASE provided issue.

I fed her...
Took her for walks.
But then came the day my dream came true...
I got my sheltie and named it Julie.
This game is absolutely great for someone who doesn't have a real dog.
I got a real, live, sheltie named Sadie.
(: It was fun at fist.
Trained her...
So when I saw this game, I was really happy!
I was too busy playing with my real dog.
Got new collars and stuff.
I have always wanted a dog.
But if you have a real dog already, there is no point in getting this game.
I wanted a cute little sheltie so much!
I got the chihuahua one because it has a sheltie on it.
After that I didn't play my dog game so much...

I didn't like the book because.
When you pick it up you want to read all of it.
It was boring.
It was hard to understand.
There really wasn't a plot.
This book I didn't think was any good.
The only Major event happens at the end of the story.
Hinton added in things that didn't need to be put in the book.
But it is an interesting book.
Those are the main reasons why I don't like this book.
It's boring.
The story has nothing to do with the end or the climax.
The book just went on and on.
Didn't have a good plot if it even had a plot.
It's like the climax just was picked out of a hat.
The auther S.E.
It constantly skipped around.
Basically the book is just about a kid who goes out on dates, and gets in gang fights.

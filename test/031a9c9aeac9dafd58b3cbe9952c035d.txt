After the second one failed, I bought the wireless remote control RC1.
I take a lot of pictures that requires the camera to be mounted on a tripod.
However after receiving the switch, I noticed the switch mechanism seemed a bit cheap.
Just like the first, it stopped working in a few months too, ARRGHHHH!!!
I guess you can't have everything.
I strongly recommend you skip buying this poorly made switch on buy the wireless switch instead.
Well, I was right.
I still needed to take photos so I bought a second one.
After a few months of daily use, the switch quit working.
I wish I bought that the first time.
The only downside is you can't take a photo from behind the camera with the wireless.
It works so much better and without any wires to get in the way.
Using this remote shutter release seemed like the obvious choice.
You will be much happier.
Even before it quit, the switch started acting finicky and wouldn't take the shot right away.

kinda sister you can both play at the same time (like me).
10!!!
10 out of 5 stars.
And it only has 4!!!
It also has a 1 or 2 player system.
I like games that has over 30 levels because it cant be "easily" beteen.
In this game you can play marine Biolagy , Cheerleading*, dance and so much more~~ !!
this is the best game ever for girls.
Like magic mistery mall and the winner's circle.
I would'nt recomend the rest but this- you gotta buy!!
While you find the "secret admier".
I dont play it any more because its really boring and i've beat all the levels.
In over 30 levels .
(and how knows how to play video games) I would say : ages 7-14.
So, if you have the annoying 'I wanna- play-first-NOW!!
This is the best game of any Mary-kate and Ashley.
DUH!!
I would recomend this game to any Mary-Kate & Ashley fans!!

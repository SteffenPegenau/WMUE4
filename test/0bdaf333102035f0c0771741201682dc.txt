But other than that...
It's not as fun, and light-hearted as the first two in her series.
I found Evie to be so morose, unemotional, unexciting, and a drag.
I don't see what St. Vincent sees in her at all.
It's depressing.
That was cute.
I did skip a bit to the end and I think it picks up a little there.
I loved the first two, and I loved the strong and fun heroines.
I don't want to read about her abuse in a romance novel.
So far, I don't like it very much, and I usually love Lisa Kleypas' work, especially her two Wallflower books.
Was it just me or am I the only one who found it boring?
I am more than half way through and am trying to force myself to finish.
The book seems so serious.
If I were him, I'd go after someone else.
I hope so.
The only funny part was when they were getting married at Gretna Green.
They were fun reads.

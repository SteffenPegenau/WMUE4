For a fan of the show, this book is a must.
But this is a very definate exception.
He will be responsible for the deaths of millions.
And now I prepare to read part II...
The same applies to the rest of the characters that we knew from the series.
I typically do not like books about television shows.
THIS IS LONDO.
The events happen in spite of him AND because of him.
(Along with the Telepath trilogy) Peter David definately has a good grasp of the characters.
The only real complaints I have are to do with continuity, and those have already been expressed by other reviews here.
But through it all, he only tries to do what is right for his people.
This isn't Londo as written by some guy.
If you're not a fan, I still strongly recommend it.
Londo is a strong, very compelling character who knows through prophesy that he is going to end up badly.
He already is, and more will fall before he is done.

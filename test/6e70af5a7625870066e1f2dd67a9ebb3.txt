"BRING IT" as Tony says.
I want to be that girl who takes her boyfriend with her to find that perfect bathing suit.
Read the fitness book that comes along with it to decide which routine works best for you.
I started the classic P90X and then discovered the lean p90X which is what I wanted.
With the videos, I now only have brief "meetings" with my treadmill.
So, instead of being on week three, I'm only on week two with the lean routine.
Tony really pushes you and you want to keep up.
It is excellent for those who are already on the "fitness train."
Who wants their significant other to see the rolls?
I want that bikini body.
The variety of the workouts is great!
I've never done that before.
Not me!
P90X is not for the weak!
Oh well!

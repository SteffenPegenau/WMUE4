But... in a few months it will start making a funny noise.
Months of caked on raw sewage!
guess how it gets clean!!!!!!
You take it all apart pry of the hair & sewage scrub it down & out it back together.
Be prepared for the worst, most disgusting job of cleaning out a cat box you have ever done in your life!
You will call the company.
& is covered with sewage.
They will tell you how do disassemble this product.
The cat hair gets stuck around & on everything!
I really don't think anyone would buy it.
when I say gross I mean it!
If they did...
Funny the Cat Genie people & video's don't mention this.
Or perhaps have a terrible stenchy sewer smell that will not go away.
You will need a mask & eye protection.
You will love this product at first.

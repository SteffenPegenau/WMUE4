How awesome is that?
It's a reader's "iPod" - a must have for any serious reader.
As a reader with glasses since second grade - now at 42 years old I admit my eyes get tired and I become a lazy reader - with font size control - I have improved my comprehension of what I am reading.
I'm left handed and I use either buttons to turn pages without any problem.
I don't "skip" anymore, I read all of it and love it.
!
Here are the biggest bonus' for me: Having control of the font size.
If I'm getting bored with something, I can just start a new one, regardless of where I am.
This should make Amazon.com into what Apple has now become with the iPod.
I love my Kindle.
I love it!
I love it!
It's genious.
I've had it for two weeks.
Having my books with me whenever and wherever.
I love it!

It takes around 10 mins and isn't to hard to do.
And you'll really never use the buttons much either.
And for the price, it's pretty good.
Instalation is fairly easy.
It fits in your hand perfectly.
So it's not a life-threatening problem :) And I really wish the mouse were optical.
It's more like a stop button.
The "play/pause" button [stinks] though.
The mouse "grip" is wonderful.
A lil problem.
That is a major downer.
Sometimes the mouse and keyboard get a little sketchy... And it is a bit annoying.
But all the same, it's a good keyboard.
The Logitech Freedom Navigator is a very tight keyboard and mouse combo.
But overall it's pretty good.
The keyboard is very nice too.
But all you have to do is reconnect.

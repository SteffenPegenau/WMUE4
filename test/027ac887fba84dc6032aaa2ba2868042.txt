Amazon compared Archer Mayor's Joe Gunther to Lee Child's Jack Reacher.
Good character renditions.
Gunther is more like Robert Parker's Jesse Stone.
But the evil people are just as evil as those found in other successful series.Great story telling.
Self doubting.
And the people.
A solid first book.
I have read two in this series and like it very much.
Solid plot development.
Borderlines is a successful second act to Mayor's Open Season.
Very human.
So far.
I will read the rest of the series.Gunther is a solid small town cop.
He knows the territory.
I beg to differ.
No high tech here.

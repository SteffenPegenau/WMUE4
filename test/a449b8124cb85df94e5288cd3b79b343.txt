Could've been good, I wish he'd try again and think about plot a little more.
I looked forward to these scenes, only for the book to end on a flat note.
I loved A Danish Girl--it's up there with my favorite books ever, and I'd love to write the screenplay.
.
I loved the concept--I loved the first quarter of the novel, with the start of the Wuthering Heights romance, etc.
.
heck, he only barely brushes over Heathcliff's marriage to "Edward's" sister.
.
The generational saga with a little boost would have really set Pasadena off.
.
.
Ugh.
.
Only, I feel like Ebershoff took so long writing this section that he ignored Bronte's pace .
and our "Heathcliff" and "Catherine" never have their firey reunion w/ Catherine's mad scene .
the book is LONG, and yet he never gets to the second generation's story .
I looked forward to Ebershoff's new novel, but Pasadena is off-the mark.

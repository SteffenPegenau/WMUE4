If you are not a Crash fan, then avoid this game.
I have this game, and I play it from time to time, but really only because I am a die-hard Crash fan.
Awful.
I'm a die-hard Crash fan.
Crash Boom Bang.
The story is...
Why in the world did they even come up with this game?
The character selection should have been a lot bigger.
The mini-games are incredibly difficult and there is hardly any explanation on how to play each mini-game, there aren't even that many mini-games to begin with!
But then there's this...
The new character (and I suppose villain?)
sucks.
I really enjoy every game up until Tag Team Racing.
So yeah, everything until Tag Team Racing is good, and Tag Team Racing is decent.

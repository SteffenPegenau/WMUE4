Always stops exactly where you set it!
Opened it up, main gear jumped several teeth.
Realigned, same thing again.
This BRAND NEW Channel Master 9521A antenna rotor wasted my whole day.
Degree reading a joke!
Read reviews before you buy.
I took apart my 30 year old Alliance Tennarotor (still working) re-lubricated it & put it back up.
Hooked it up on the ground, went about 1/3 way around then bound up!
Drive motor of cheapest quality.
I have a backround in electronics.
No sync, runs off with each movement.
Works perfectly.
I am sure some of these work, but quality is poor.
Some other brands have complaints too.
An $89 piece of junk!
Read other reviews on this & you will probably forget it.

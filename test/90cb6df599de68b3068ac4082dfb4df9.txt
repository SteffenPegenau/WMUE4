Some other artists dont, belive me.
Track 4There you go, is one of my favourites.
But the voice.
This album from 2000 is here debut album.
You can hear here humming voice on Split Personality and you know that this artist has something to tell.
She has star quality all over.Track 12 Hiccup is another winner.
So cute, so good lookin, so raw and unpolished.
A must in youre Pink Collection.
Its a pity i can`t take here home.
Track 10 Stop Falling is a sweetie two.
Everytime she speaks, she has that Janis Joplin inspired voice, which gives that makes me shiver in a good way.
The voice has a pain in side, as she realy means what she sings.
It`s so rytmic that my feets starts to tap hysterically'.
The reason why i dont give it a 5 star, is that some tracks is a bit "unstable" and doesn't have the quality which surley comes on here next album Missundaztood.
The dreamgirl next door, with a voice from another planet, which is difficult to describe in words.

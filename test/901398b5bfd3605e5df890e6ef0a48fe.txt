The only thing that bothered me was the series ended leaving me so puzzled!
I keep wondering, did Mandy and Jessie hook up?
I could't put the book down once i started reading it.
I loved the last book in the series!
I totally fell in love with the characters and i was really waiting for Anothony and Rae to hook up!
It was so great!
Fingerprints is my new favorite book series!
I would sit in my room and read it till 3 o'clock in the morning telling myself just one more chapter but i couldnt stop!
When does Sam die?
She needs to make another book for me to be fully satisfied!
But other than the ending, i totally LOVED the book!
Did Anthony and Rae ever marry?
Are the gaurds that saw Yana and Sam escape come after them again!?
i often go to Little Five Points so that was a big bonus!
The series also took place where i live, Atlanta, Ga!

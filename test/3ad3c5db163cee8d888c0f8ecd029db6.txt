I never read the books it was based on.
The production quality is actually still quite good compared to certain movies today.
But I am not making a sentimental review.
Not only are you NOT GETTING the UNSEEN FOOTAGE on the left and right, but you are also LOSING the top and bottom footage!
The WIDESCREEN DVD is not correct at all.
It is the full screen version with bars on the top and bottom!
Because I am rating the product as a whole.I gave it three stars for the quality of the product.
So you don't get what you paid for!
It is an outright problem that needs to be remedied.
I saw Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory as a kid.
I prefer widescreen over fullscreen so I can see the director's vision of the movie!
The music has some standout performances.
It's exactly as I remember it.
It is a great KIDS film.
So why the 3 star rating?
I like the dark humor that exists in the movie.
Scandalous!

If you've never listened to them before, get Frankenstein Girls Seem Strangely Sexy first.
I'll tell you this much, the song is about a guy and a 5-year old girl.
You can listen to the entire thing in like 20-25 min.
You've got "Thank God", a song that pokes fun at the rappers at award shows who always thank God for their lyrics, even though they sing about drugs and sex and killing.
This album is great.
Because it is so messed up and wrong that it's awsome.
The sound quality [stinks].
And you can barely understand what they are saying.
The most unbelievably wrong song ever.
Buy it if you like MSI.
This album is screwed up.
I mean really short.
Sick sick stuff.
This album is short.
So why should you buy this?
But, it's like, forget what everyone else things, they do their own thing and that's cool.
Then there's Panty Shot.

So I bought two of these devices and placed them in areas they like to go.
And up-date the results.
I've read some of the reviews here and found them quite informative.
One early evening, around dusk.
And I assuming she's feeding them every evening.I really don't hate cats.
Yeap, we have the neighborhood cat lady.
But within a couple of weeks I discovered that the back yard serves as the neighborhood litter box for cats.
So far it works well...a little history.
I just don't want them to use my back yard as their personal latrine.
We rented this small house a month ago and it comes with a front and back yards.
So....I'll order one more.
THEY BOTH WORKS....After a few days the cats are going in the one area in the back yard that is not covered.
Around the corner on the side of the house where the gas and electric utility meters are.

We were taking a stroll down the street when we saw no less than 9 cats sitting on the front lawn near the front door.

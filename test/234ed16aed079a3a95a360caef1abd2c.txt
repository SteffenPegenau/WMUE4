He is charming, witty, just so adorable.
I liked man in the moon, it is a good drama.
It's a classic but it will never be too old for any genre.
(my fav.
My favorite!!
Now Benny and Joon.
Here I got a 2 for one deal.
He plays a slightly different character in this film, he is a bit autistic one might say?
I don't know how anyone can not fall in love with Johnny Depp.
Yes, he was great in Pirate's of the Caribbean.
You need a box of kleenex though.
He plays his character to the fullest.
part is him doing hat tricks)
i found it to be a tear jerker at some point.
Don't take my word for it, do a search for Benny and Joon movie trailer, watch the preview and then you just might see where I'm coming from.
This movie is like a breath of fresh air!

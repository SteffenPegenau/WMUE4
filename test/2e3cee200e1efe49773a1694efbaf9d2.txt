Shockingly little of The Little Friend rings true.
It's all grinding and machination and hard work that doesn't gel.
Was she bullied into cranking out this false new book?
The Secret History's a true masterpiece of storytelling and mood.
So.
A sense of being let down.
I've only waited six years for this book to come out - since I got around to reading The Secret History kind of late in life, after it had already been around (and I resisted it for years) - but still, that book blew me away when I finally dove into it.
Also a feeling of concern for the author.
Disappointment.
Or was it all a beautiful fluke to begin with, too good to be true?
I don't believe that Tartt's heart was in it.
With a feeling of having been duped.
I almost couldn't finish it, and when I did, it left me empty.
Where did Tartt's magic go?
Sadness.
How can I accurately convey my feelings about The Little Friend?

But it's a novel, a story, and authors are allowed to play around with reality.
But I enjoyed her book for what it is, a good story.
Does the plot keep me intrigued and reading?
I wondered at how nonchalant her characters feel towards sex.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Did it make me feel something?
Do her characters have depth?
Ms Moynahan's novel made me laugh, cry, and remember my own first teenage love.
Does she describe her locales well enough that I get a sense of place?
Yes, but so is life.I laughed as she described the cliques and the classrooms.
Yes.
Is her prose occasionally melodramatic and at times over-the-top?
Yes.
So, I recommend it as good girly fluff to wallow in on a cold winter afternoon.
I was taken away from my daily routine into a world different from my own, and glad for the minivacation.Is it great literature?
As other reviews have alluded, the story is a bit fantastic, with unrealistic twists and turns.

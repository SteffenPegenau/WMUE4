So i slapped some tape on this and called it a day.
Well this product works.
Loud and un natural.
I bought this for my 04 colorado and im glad i did.
This has enough wire to make your instilation interestng at best.
The speaker box being the size of donald trumps wallet had magically broke open.
Lets just say that.
Now by the design of this it looks to be a common thing.
NAY NAY I SAY!!!
I went to many retail stores in my town any they wanted 90 100 and even 125 for a harness.
Common at that i would say, you cannot even look at this without flopping open and spilling its jewels.
Well being the hebrew that i am i decided to check amazon.
Well when i took the product out the first problem had occured.
But it works.
Also the chime is at best the sound of a dying duck.
60 was the lowest i could find.

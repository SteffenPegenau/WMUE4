Stay tuned
As I packaged the product, I noticed that the disc had some light scuff ( round circular) marks.
BEWARE!
The disc now has lines around the entire disc making it unsellable in "Like New" condition.
I believe that I was misled into thinking that by using this product, I would restore the original finish to the disc.
BEWARE!
If you are looking to remove scratch marks and scuff marks from the disc, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
As for restoring a disc that is unplayable, that, I can't tell you about because my disc played fine BEFORE I used this system.
BEWARE!
If you are looking to restore the original shiny surface of the disc, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
The disc played fine before and after using this device.
IT DID NOT!
I purchased this unit, thinking that it would correct this problem.
I sold a used cd on Amazon as "Like New" condition.
I will now try to look for something to restore the original finish.

I loved it when it worked.
Another 9 months later, same thing happened.
Since it was still under warranty, I sent the player in.
When I got the player back the serial number sticker wasn't even completely stuck on the player.
I called to see how much it would cost to repair.
I loved that it worked with Windows Media Player.
Same error message and everything.
I think Toshiba just sent me a refurbished player that they swapped the serial number on.
Only now, the warranty had expired.
I reloaded the player and went right on using it.
I had to put a piece of tape on it just so it wouldn't fall off.
I decided I could just go get another player with my money.
Easy to use, great sound.
$200 just to send it in with no guarantee that they could/would fix it for that price.
Probably less that 9 months after I had it, the player quit - dead.
I had this player for a year and a half.

this sub looks like it has about 9 or 10 mm of xmax.
This is a well built sub, all but the voice coil.
I have a 300 watt sony.
I only had it for two days.
Lanzar doesn't tell you how much it really has.
It will not handle the watts it claims to handle.
This is my first and will be my last.
And the voice coil is already burning.
I will not be buying anymore Lanzar subs.
It wasn't moving alot either.
A great box and a very small amp is what you will need for this sub.
It does sound good at low volumes.
( one way).
But it peformed like it had only 2 or 3 mm.
the surround looks like it would move alot.
But it's not a high spl sub like it looks.

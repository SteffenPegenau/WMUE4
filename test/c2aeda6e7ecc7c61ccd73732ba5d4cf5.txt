this was hokey and predictable and was not clever or witty at all.
and last but not least 3) good story.
I couldn't wait for the end.
1) Fun & likable characters.
didn't care too much about the music in the film.
I almost fell asleep I was so bored.
None here.
no wonder it's underrated.
3 things that make Disney so great are all missing here.
great mouse detective is not so great.
2) music.
no catchy tunes or sing-along songs.
Even the villian (though played brilliantly by Price) is mundane and lacks charisma.
the characters weren't even likable.
am I the only one that found this movie boring and pointless?

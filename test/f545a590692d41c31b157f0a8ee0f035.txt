DISC 2.
BUT WERE DID MCA GET THE MASTERS FOR THIS SET.
DISC 4.
IT'S BEST TO DEAL WITH AN IMPORT CD.
IT HAS ALOT OF HITS.
NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT.
I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS BOX SET.
YOU MIGHT GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH.
IM STILL STANDING RUFF CUT, NOT SMOOTH AND ACT OF WAR, TURN IT UP LOAD DESTORTION, LIKE IT WAS,NT REMASTERED BUT MASTERED INSTEAD.
DISC 3.
I OWN A FEW MCA RECORDINGS THAT WERE REMASTERED.
IT COST MONEY TO GET A PERFECT SOUND.
A FEW OF THEM DONT SOUND AS GOOD REMASTERED AS THEY SHOULD BE.
ON DISC 1, (2) SONGS HAVE DROP OUTS IN THE RECORDING, DANIEL IS A RUFF CUT NOT SMOOTH AS I HEARD ON A 2-TRACK MASTER DONE BY STEVE HOFFMAN.
PHILADELPHIA FREEDOM AND ISLAND GIRL COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER.

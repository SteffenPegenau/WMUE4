He dies.
Great effects.
Often I am thinking don't open the basement door and walk downstairs.
Because this one did not interest me.
He opens up a can of poison and drinks it.
REALLY there is nothing scary about it unless you have not seen something coming out of ones mouth, chest or abdomen in other movies.The opening scene on "Earth".
I didn't.Story disjointed.
Just in case I missed something important.
Doesn't live up to the hype either in the mags or other media.I watched it twice.
The end.
Needs a bit more explanation.
I would think futuristic people capable enough to do DNA engineering would have rudiments of the scientific method down.
Rush week on planet X!
But they do.
But then again, alot of discovery's have been made when the scientist uses himself as a Guinea pig.Then the other part of the movie starts.It was so bad I don't even care to see the sequel when it comes out.

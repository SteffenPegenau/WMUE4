So, this was a good book.
The hallmark of Oprah's books is that they are bleak yet hopeful -- until the end, that is, when her book choices are still bleak but all hope has been unrefuteably obliterated.
The book does draw you in.
It is well-written, and the characters are believeable and engrossing.
My problem is not that the final twists of the plot are implausible (which they most certainly are.)
Nothing to feel good about.
However, the plot leads us on and on into what is finally a dismal abyss.
It is enthralling and difficult to put down.
No hope at all.
But take heed: there is no happy ending here.
So finally, I was left unsatisfied even though it was a good read.
This book is indeed a page-turner.
My problem is that the entire ending of the book is simply miserable.
None.
I found myself caring for the characters and rooting for one over the other.
And really, I should have known.

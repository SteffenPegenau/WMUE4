Really riveting stuff there.
And we see Peggy rise from secretary to copywriter.
But why spend so much time with the supportining characters and not enough time with the leads?
Now that she's a copywriter, it seems like the writers didn't know what to do with her during Season Two.
Don is back to his old tricks and that's about it.
And Peggy.
It seemed like Season Two focused more on the supporting characters, such as Sal, Ken and Paul.
Almost nothing.
What do we get in Season Two?
I guess the best you can say about her is that she gives free advice to the priest on public speaking.
Not recommended.
We get to know Don better through his long-lost brother.
Again--really riveting stuff there.
Oh...and he's against dropping the Mohawk Airlines account for the American Airlines account.
This was the problem with Season Two and one of the reasons why it was boring.
In Season One, both Don Draper and Peggy Olson have a strong story arc.

Look out for the lamest ending.
My problem lied with the Predator.
So much material in these legacys and that is the best they can do?
Instead we get a friendly predator who makes nice-nice with a woman and they tag team the queen.
That was until I saw the TV spots and I heard those dreaded words, RATED PG13.
Oh, yes!
At least after many years of rumors, it was made.
My main objection is that it could have been so much more.
My heart sank.
I mean, please.
Maybe the sequel will go for it and not worry about attracting the teenie bop market.
Forget "Spiderman 2," this was the film I was looking so foward too.
(...) We want gore, blood, guts.
The alien was relentless in his pursuits.
The special effects were great.
How can a movie based on 2 hardcore R rated film series compromise itself with a lesser rating?The storyline was clever.
Still, I enjoy seeing any monster movie.

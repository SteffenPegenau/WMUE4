This is not the same at all to me.
This book was pretty good and I held off from getting it after reading the jacket.
I think in her mind she needed her daughter more than anything.
That was the best!.
I wanted Big Walt and the daughter to hook up.
But they didn't.
Yes, the format.
I missed the suspense.
I don't remember seeing errors in the book either, which is a serious pet-peeve of mine.
Basically, because of Shades of Jade.
I don't think she loved her daughter or new how to love.
The font was easy on the eyes but not elementary.
The ending was not what I wanted it to be.I also want to say that I appreciated the format of the book.
But all in all this was entertaining.The mother was terrible.
But it kept calling me back.
I really like Gloria Mallette.
The chapter headings were even special.
The best part of the story to me was funeral.

And so much faster at transferring.
I am so upset with this product I'm ready to throw it right in the garbage.
Go with another brand.
Well I do but you know what?
Once it is on the Riot it's stuck and there is no way to get it off or transfer it back to a hard drive.
This Riot is not worth the money at all.
I deleted my music from the other player thinking that I now had it all on the new Riot.
Whatever happened to open standards?
That is ridiculous considering the other 20 gig MP3 player I had was just a USB hard drive.
I transferred all 20 gigs of my music from my other MP3 Player to this new Riot and now I'm [in trouble].
I called their tech support and they said there is no way to get my music back.
My other MP3 Player even worked under Linux.
So much better.
This Riot is the slowest piece of garbage I have ever used.
And you have to use Real Jukebox to transfer your files.
There's no other choice.

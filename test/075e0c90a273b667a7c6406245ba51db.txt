James leaves the burden of singing to the audience.
The band is playing their same old while the orchestra is constantly trying to show their presence which I don't feel is adding value to it all.
Same old and not very exciting stuff.
I suspect the guys where a bit too lazy for that.
Which leads to the question why didn't tape it in the studio.
If they did there wasn't a excuse left for producing a overbloated album.
It contains stuff which I personaly heard to too many times performed live.
Why did they even think of those?
I am very disappointed in this CD.
Reload is the only album I don't have.
The singing is not very strong either.
I really hate those tracks.
The should have used tracks which are better suited for an orchestra.
(geez!)
The even had the nerve to put Devils Dance on it and the memory remains.
Why did they even allow audience to the set?

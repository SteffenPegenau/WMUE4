song by song1.
I wish it had more songs, and better guitar from him, but you can't have everything.for any body interested in him, this is ok, but hopefully he can top it next time.i do like the cd booklet.
new deep- nice lyrics.introspective.
something's missing- great delivery , great lyrics.
that oooooh.
bigger than my body- Great anthem.
8/105.come back to bed- alright.all in all, this cd is very interesting.
maybe john needs to rock a little harder, be a little more passionate.Lyrically, he has definitely evolved.
clarity- I would've thought ?uestlove would've delivered a little better.
10/103.
no such thing part 2. very popish, but very john.
I'm sort of disappointed.
9/104.
sound is kind of weird, but it is a great song.
but sonorously, his voice never changes.
song- 8/102.
somethings missing.
Well,well well.

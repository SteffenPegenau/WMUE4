I absolutely loved that song.
When Funkmaster Flex was doing his thing on the radio here in New York.
This was undeniably one of my favorite jams that I had let slip out of my private collection.
this was my jam.
Being young and carefree.
I couldnt believe it , I hadnt heard this song since 1993.
People walkin by couldnt stop staring into the car at me because i couldnt stop singing.
All of a sudden im frozen at the sound of the vocals coming from the radio.
I was like oh freakin snap.
It brought back alot of memories of a less stressful more fun time in my life.
I will definitely be playing this one at my parties and share it with my friends.
Truly a die hard hit.
I am purchasing the album to keep in my private hits collection.
I was jumpin in the car two nights ago on my way to this party on a boat.
Flex started off his mix with the track "let me be" and the vocals slowly came in after the instruments from the lead singer kenny.

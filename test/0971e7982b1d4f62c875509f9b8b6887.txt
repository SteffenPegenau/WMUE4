The acting is so annoying, I actually punched the T.V.
(not many zombies)most entertaining part: when all those yuppies DIE!!!!!!
THEY ALL MUST DIE!!!!!!
One of the yuppies performs a ritual that's suppose to scare the other yuppies.
THE END!OK!
and turns them into zombies as well.
!PEACE, and RESPECT :)
The movie starts when these annoying yuppies go to a prison.
to try and shut them up!Especially that one yuppie who kept licking his lips (that should tell you something).
Everything about this movie is stupid!!!!!!
I HATE THIS FILM WITH SUCH BURNING HATRED!!!!
But it was a joke.
OH but the ritual actually DID did raise a whopping 3 zombies from the ground and they hunt down and kill those fools (YES!
:) So one final yuppie survives the whole thing and that's all!
I ACTUALLY WISH THEY KILLED THEM IN REAL LIFE!!!!!)

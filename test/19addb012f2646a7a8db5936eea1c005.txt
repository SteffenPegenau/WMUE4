The tone isn't as full and rich as my Yamaha.
Do yourself a favor and change the strings to something lighter.
Also, change the nut and bridge.
BOTTOM LINE - if you are thinking about a 12 string, this guitar is a safe purchase and you will need to invest a few more dollars to get it setup for YOU.
I've been playing guitar for years and the 'cables' installed from the manufacturer hurt MY fingers.
It's not a bad guitar for the money.
Invest another $100 and have the guitar set up by a professional.
It would discourage a new player altogether.
- maybe.
Buy a case to protect it.
I wish I would have had the opportunity (time/access) to play a few demos at a music store but the price offered by Amazon was worth the risk.
Would I buy it again?
Many factors affect tuning (temp, humidity, playing time) but this guitar requires more frequent tuning than my Yamaha 12 string.
Keeping the guitar tuned has also been a challenge.
This can be done very inexpensively during the setup.

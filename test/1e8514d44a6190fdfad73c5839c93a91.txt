The DS and the PSP's graphics are now considered really good and 3-D.
Even when you go near a light source that you still can barely see the screen whatsoever.
The graphics for this system is really outdated and really boring.
I say either go for the Nintendo DS Lite.
But you can play GBA games on the DS, so what is the point anyways.
Most of the games for the DS and the PSP are 3-D anyways.
It is way to dark.
It is not 32 bit it is 16, (which was still really good for that time).
First of all.
Now!!
!
That is the only good thing about the system.
Even the games that are 2-D look so much better than the GBA.
It doesn't seem like a big deal because you can just go near a light source, WRONG!!
The games for the system o the other hand are pretty good.
There is no backlite or frontlite.
It is too outdated.
You can't adjust the brightness like you can on the Sp or the DS lite.
But now, it is not good.

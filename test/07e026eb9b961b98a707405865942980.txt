I have also made jigs that are stiffer that do not flex.
I love the fact that I spend so much less time sharpening my tools etc.
I do not like the dimond dressing attachment.
I have had this machne for 3 years and am on my second stone.
I had to make a longer guide so I could slide the blade all the way accross.
It makes for a very flat stone in less time.
I buy and sell antique tools as well as make custom furniture.
I machined a new jig that would hold the $20 dimond dressing wheel by Delta.
This is a wood carvers dream come true.
Happy Sharpening
I also wonder why someone else has not made a knock off at a better price.
Time is money and even at the price they charge I have made my money back many times over with the time saved.
I sharpened my 13 planer blades.
I have used it to sharpen every thing but my internal gouges.
Having a small machine shop on the side has made the machine more usable for my needs.

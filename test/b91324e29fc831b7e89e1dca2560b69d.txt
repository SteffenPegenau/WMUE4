I was crying, I admit it.
I also loved Achilles.
I respect that all the actors also did all their own fighting.
The cinematography is awesome and so is the acting.
A LOT!!
Brad Pitt did an awesome job as Achilles and Eric Bana was superb.
I love Hector throughout this movie.
I salute the actors.
Needless to say, I was suspicious about whether I should rent it or not.
Ultimately, this has to be my favorite movie.
This movie did not deserve those bad revies.
The only character I didn't like was Paris.
Not at all.
This movie got a lot of bad reviews.
I'm so glad I did!
He was awesome and then he went and died.
I love Orlando Bloom and he did a good job acting, but I didn't like his character.

It simply is not comparable.
A real computer game for real computer gamers.
It is cheap too!
THis game has great action, great weapons, fun driving and swimming.
Not some stupid console port!
It rocks and looks fantastic.
Now I already know what all the console fan bois are going to say, so dont waste our time on this PC review.
I really cheered when I shot my first heli down.
I am running gtx 470 video, i7 socket 1366 on x58 with triple channel ddr3 and all ssd system.
I remember when it came out, It would not play well at all on my cool gaming rig of the time.
Most real pc gamers dont even care what console gamers think, period.
Cheers!
This game is finally playable in maxed out mode with my current high end hardware.
Now it does, years later and it is awsome.
My pc is full gaming rig and runs it well.

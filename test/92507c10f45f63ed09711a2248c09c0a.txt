pretty stupid also when that french guy runs after it with the worst dubbing in history chanting "oh, my car, oh my car, oh my car."
he looks funny in it.
first moore is just way too old.
the scene in paris when the car falls in half and still drives.
you can save a few bucks.
do not buy this.
i know every movie.
it drags for so long!
rent it to see if you like it first.trust me.
i love the opening song by Duran Duran but other than that, the movie stinks.
i am a huge bond fan.
second, cheapy probs and sets.
it is by far, the worst bond movie outthere.
and third, the movie just doesn't end!
Roger Moore was one of my favorite bonds untill i saw this movie.

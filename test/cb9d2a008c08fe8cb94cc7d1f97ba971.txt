The last time my son hit his head on the concrete!!
The wheel base is just too short for the height of the stroller.
Like most of the other reviewers we loved this stroller when we bought it.
It was just what we needed.
!
I gave it two stars because it worked great when he was a baby.
All while my son was strapped in!!
He could have been seriously injured!!
With the brakes locked and the stroller sitting on a flat surface it has TIPPED OVER TWICE AND NEARLY TIPPED OVER A THIRD TIME!
Now, it's another piece of junk taking up space in our garage!
It was great for maneuvering around tight areas, especially small elevators!
Curbs and bumpy sidewalks were no problem.
He still fits well in the stroller but as he has grown it has become more and more unstable.
Add a toddler reaching out of it and you have a potentially very dangerous situation!!
My son just turned 2 and is 3 feet tall.

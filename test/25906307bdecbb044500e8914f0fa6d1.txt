bang!).
Remember when we were kids, this toy had pegs that fit tightly into the holes?
She did enjoy this toy for a short while, but not nearly as much as the loud-banging one.
HINT: the old-fashioned version will have longitudinal slots cut into each end of the peg.
Just a light tap pushes the pegs through the holes.
My 2.5-year-old daughter LOVES the old-fashioned version.
Do not buy this toy unless you can't tolerate kid noise at all.
This toy now has rubber rings on the insides of the holes.
BEWARE, PARENTS!
Well, that version of the toy is hard to come by now; I had to order one from England.
Argh.
bang!
The rings become loose after a really short period of use, and the pegs just fall right through them.
Even before the rings get loose, the pegs sit in them wobbly and kids don't get the thrill of getting to pound those pegs (bang!
Try to find the old-fashioned version of this toy, with the tight-fitting pegs.

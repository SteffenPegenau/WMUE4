Prancing around the stage like a long haired ballerina in tennis shoes.
In the 80's the same arena was so packed you couldn't movean inch.
I saw them on this tour and the arena was half full.
Even though they sounded old and tired every song was decent.
Nirvana and Co. single handedly destroyed our beloved 80's metal.
"No Prayer For the Dying" was the last quality Maiden album.
A crack in the armour that has only gotten worse since the unspeakable horror that is Blaze or whatever that singer's name is.
BTW, his solo albums arelight years ahead of the [stuff] Maiden put out after this one.
Bruce saw the writing on the wall and bailed out just in time.
The biggest long haired [person] that ever strapped on a guitar.
"Fear" is a total hit and miss affair.
Not only are his guitar solos utterly horrific he is the worst heavy metal performer in history bar none.
Don't even get me started on Gers.
A first for Maiden.
Alas, a sign of the times.

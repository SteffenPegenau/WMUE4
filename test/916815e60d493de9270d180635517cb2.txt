Overall she found the pace too slow and the story too predictable.
I agree somewhat.
My wife and I watched the DVD.
By and large the film is good, but perhaps too much is taken from the Swedish plot.
In this sense there is little action.
She found that Bergman overacted a lot.
I found the sharpness of the images excellent.
She also found that Howard was too passive, as in his other films.
In an historical perspective a very very good example of transplanted stars and story.
In later films, Bergman's acting improved a great deal--I suspect she was too much into the European style, and adapted with time.
The sound track is very good.
Overall good but not great.
I believe this film is meant to make us consider what life is all about, and whether we should risk a home for adventure.
The acting of the secondary leads was better than the two leading actors.
My wife found that Ingrid Bergman was not really pretty and too large compared to the other cast.

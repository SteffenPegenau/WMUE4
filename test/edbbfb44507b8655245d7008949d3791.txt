You at least should pay me back for the ink I bought to debug your design flaw!!
Replaced with a proper Epson black ink last night, then the printer pretent normal, but print blank pages.
Put a new color ink then clean head, clean head...
Then wasted more money for this cleaning heads...
Clean head, clean head and clean head ... still blank pages.
You need to a new color ink in order to continue.
Still print blank pages..
!EPSON, I hope to see your company out of business!!
*?$%$#!
STILL blank pages.
Eventually changed all color inks.
I owned this printer a little over a year, printed less than 300 pages, paid more than $100 for the ink.
!
After used up one other color ink, couldn't print and couldn't clean head.
My Epson CX84 is an ink drinker or you can say money eater!!

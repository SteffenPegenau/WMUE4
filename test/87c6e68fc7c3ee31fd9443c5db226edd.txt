But this is crap.
I havent bough this CD but...
Especially the vocals, its like a moron singing in his sleep, no really.
Also, they could have at least made this album on a decent whatever the hell it is you use to make all these lame sounds called techno.
But it sounds like a MIDI file, frighteningly so.
You guys suck.
Just listen to the sound files on this page, and if you havent heard the original Pink Floyd album, listen to the sound files for that and compare.
What are you doing?
No contest.
Even if you somehow dont like the original The Wall, how can you like this??
I think an attempt at creating a dance version of The Wall is a pretty cool idea in this day and age.
So sterile and lifeless.
Talk about a bad career choice.
Hello, Out of Phase??
The same goes for their horrible attempt at Dark Side of the Moon 2001.

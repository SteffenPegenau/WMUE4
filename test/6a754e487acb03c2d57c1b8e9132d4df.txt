I have no problem with a tantalizing sex scene.
Where is the story?
It's also gone the way of the thin and plotless.
But, no dice.This is the last Anita Blake story I'll ever buy.
Where is Anita's job?
I am sadly disappointed with this latest incarnation of Anita Blake.
Where are the zombies?
But, these scenes have gone from tantalizing to repetitive to downright boring.Where are the bad guys?
I'm sorry to say that unless Laurell K. Hamilton can take the time to develop a real story, I'll also have to abstain from her Meredith Gentry series as well.
Well, those days are over.
When I first discovered Anita Blake 2 years ago I was at the book store like a pregnant woman looking for pickles.
Where are the cops?
The vampire ballet, which seemed to be the point of the whole story, didn't appear until well into the third and final act.
There was ample opportunity for the visiting vamps to have brought mayhem with them as was seen in Burnt Offerings.
Where is the mystery?

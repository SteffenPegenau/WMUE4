It shut down during use and wouldn't turn back on.
So i'm out $500 and I'll be sure never to buy another Canon product.
I'll admit, the first two weeks I used this camera it was great.
I sent the camera back to Canon Factory, hoping it would be fixed or for a replacement, however, I was told that it was unrepairable and I was SOL - basically.
From what?
However, I never really had the chance to find out for sure b/c after two weeks my camera stopped working.
Good luck!
Reason?
After reading reviews/complaints I found that this was a common problem among Canon products.
corrosion.
This way it will last at least a few months.
Advice for consumers - keep your camera in bubble wrap and don't use it.
- Canon wouldn't say.
How is this possible after two weeks and only 3 uses?!?!?!?!
I feel I've been had by the Canon people.

It's cathedralic in classic fashion: good.
Nail the pretty CD picture--in the case, with CD included--to your wall.
But where the *heck* did the cheesy affirmations in the second track come from?
Why let this unfortunate rotten dumpling in the rich multicultural stew that is Enigma spoil my entire opinion?
"Don't accept average habits"?
Lovely.
And not even this fuming heap of an album will change my mind.I like the recurring O Fortuna theme.
Yes, yes I am.
And wait it out.
I'm a big, fat Enigma fan.
Couldn't they have said it in French, at least?
It's positively embarassing to listen to, even with no-one else in the room.
And that embarassment lingers with one throughout the rest of the obviously lackluster album, making it difficult to relax into the trademark Enigma meditative state.Yes, I'll buy the next album.
I won't hold it against them, and neither should you.
I've got them all, why break the chain?

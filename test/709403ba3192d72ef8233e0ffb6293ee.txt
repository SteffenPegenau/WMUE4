Amusing but defintely not on the same level as Adam's true talent.
This newest album is nowhere near as funny as his last two comedy skit albums.
Especially when you compare it to anything else he has done in the past.
The "Hot Water Burn Baby" bit?
The "Cool Guy" skits?
Sorry but buyer beware....this album is not that great.
After having eagerly waited for Adam Sandler's latest comedy album to appear....I would have to say his latest album is a big letdown!
What the hell was that?
Save your money and get Adam's "They're All Gonna Laugh At You!"
It was slightly amusing but not funny.
Stardom has hit Adam Sandler the wrong way.
or "What The Hell Happened To Me" if you haven't already done so.
Again...what the hell was that?
Now those albums were absolutely hysterical!
The more famous he gets the less funny he seems to be.

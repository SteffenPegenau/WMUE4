Help, which comes by the way in the form of leaving a window open so "Barbie" can commit a home invasion in the name of the greater good.
I'll be sticking with the Barbie worth watching, in the older movies!!
Worst yet?
!
Tossed by the wayside in favor of a bratty bully.Are.
This movie was horrific.
Princesses lessons that consist of tea pouring and curtsies, because obviously that's all princesses are good for.
Where to begin!
Her two best pals who stuck by her and encouraged her?
kidding.
me.This movie is garbage.
you.
Mean girl behavior.
"Barbie" has the self confidence of a jelly fish.
Bullies, both among peers and teachers.
At the end of the movie she gives her bully a coveted position as a reward for "helping" her.
It started out well enough, hard working "Barbie" supporting her family.Then Charm School begins.
I have nothing good to say.
Strict focus that appearance is all that matters.

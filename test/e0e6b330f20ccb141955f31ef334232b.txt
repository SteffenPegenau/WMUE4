!The gameplay is just everywhere.
The worst sound is when the flying characters go 'wee' when they fly.
The game is messy-everywhere.
The only good level is the pinball levels.
you may like it.The voice acting is purely horrible.
But again I guess this game is targeting kids more than grown ups.
Thats a typicall sonic thing.
Its just not nice to listen to.
Really- it is bad.
If you like wierd rhythms and if your a sonic music fan>??
its just nerve wrecking.
The rest is just...not to my liking.The graphics are OK on all consoles, but they feel...just not right.
They just repeat the same things over and over.
I'd say it is great for any sonic fan, but Its just not right for me.
hey, I'm only 15!
I'd say Sonic fans may adore it, but if you dont like sonic, you obviously dont like this.
Its not too bad, though.The enemies are ok. Not too hard, not too easy.All in all this game isn't rubbish unless you just dont like sonic.
dodgy.The sound is complete craze.

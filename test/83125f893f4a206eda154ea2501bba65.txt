Sorry Mr. Cagle, I would like to purchase the c.d.
The last c.d.
would be well worth the money if not for the copyright protection.
but not when the chances of it playing are slim to none.
It popped, skipped, and basically sounded terrible.
I bought that had the much hated protection would not play in my Chevy Colorado c.d.
that may or may not play in my vehicle?
And I might add, the stereo system was standard, I did not take out the system and upgrade.
While I understand (I guess) the rational behind copyright protection I do not understand why anyone would think that the average person would spend money on a c.d.
Now, why, pray tell, would I buy a c.d.
The last c.d.
The c.d.
and hope against hope that it would play.
(Joss Stone) played fine in the Toyota Tundra but it sounded like a scratchy 45 in the Colorado.
player.

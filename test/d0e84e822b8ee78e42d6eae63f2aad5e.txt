I could never take it off because then you would see how sweaty I was.
I can finally wear my favorite shirts without a hoodie or jacket over it!
THANKS ALOT!!!
I hated it.
Then I found CertainDri.
And it was just embarrassing.
I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!!
=)
I LOVE IT!!!
Seriously people, this changed my life!
I have tried the clinical strength deodorants and just about anything to try and stop this excessive sweating.
All year around I would wear a hoodie or a jacket, even in the hottest days of summer...
It was terrible.
There is sweat no more!
I just kept thinking, I'm a freaking girl, why am I sweating like a man?!?!

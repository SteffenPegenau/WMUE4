the charger, the DC adaptor, or upgrade the memory (the 4MB is a joke) to 32MB, etc.
Then, if you want to upgrade to the Lithium battery, .
15 - 20 minutes per pair of batteries max.
.
But what good are they when the batteries keep dying?
Everyting everybody writes here is is true...this thing eats up batteries like you won't believe!
I took the plunge and bought this camera.
Wow.
etc All are sold seperately.
It's incredibly frustrating.
If you want a similar camera, at the same price, that has more memory(16MB), uses RECHARGEABLE long-life Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries and includes the charger, try the FujiFilm FinePix 2600 Zoom.Buyer beware!
It must be ($$$$) Sony!I returned this camera in less than 12 hours after purchasing.
You can't just grab some no name accesories either.
.
I liked the style and the features, I read the reviews and disbelieved the battery problems.
The Sony has great features.
I won't be tethered to Sony for the rest of my life.

Get a life!!!!
This one is simply billed as a horror film.
Unfortunately, when you edit one bad scene to the next, you simply can't win.This British loser must have been made by someone who ventured through WW2.
It's worth maybe $5.99.The soundtrack completely sucks...the acting is average...and the editing is the highlight.
Why is it the British always want to embellish their hatred for the Germans?
This had to be the slowest moving horror flick on the planet.
And that's being nice.
It has the nauseating military twist to it that simply doesn't fit today.
It gets a 2!!!
Move on!!!!
That's right...it is simply horrible!!!
Horror buffs need to take "28 Days Later" into muchly needed inconsideration.
I spent $20 on this DVD.
It had two moments of terror...222 moments of predictable JELLO.
Make a horror film and get away from those silly military fatigues.
While this British box-office smash was commended for chills and thrills..it is truly a fiasco.

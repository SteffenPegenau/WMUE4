Sent back again, received another in about a month.
As is their return policy, where you pay the shipping and only receive a refurbished unit.
After 2 months it quit working and the overload light came on.
I purchased this unit last April 2005.
Not any longer!
Not very reputable.
Basically in my humble opinion, this a piece of junk.
I called APC and had to send it back for $25.00 shipping.
Took a month to get.
Of course you can't read it till you get it home or to the office.
Second unit did the same thing.
Same problem and booklet says it is an internal error, when it does this.
States so in their "warranty".
Used to be a good company with good products.
Their policy is to send a "refurbished" unit.
My last unit a "Contaxt" lasted over 8 years.
I unplugged my computer and monitor, (only things plugged into it), and it still wouldn't work and light said "overloaded".
Now this one just went out also.
Not a "fault" in my wiring or "reverse polarity, or anything else on my part.

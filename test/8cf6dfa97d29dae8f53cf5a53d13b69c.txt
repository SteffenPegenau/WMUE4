Leash is a little short.
Feels and looks sturdy5.
Wrist strap is nice, but I wish it had an adjustable feature on it.
It would be just as easy for me to wrap a longer, regular leash around my hand and work it manually.3.
It makes it easier for me to clip it onto my dog's harness.Cons:1.
A little heavy for the amount of leash it holds2.
Always retracts to the stop tab (not the clip)3.
He ends up pulling against it when walking.4.
I've had it slip off my hand and scared the heck out of my dog.
It's nice, but maybe for a slightly larger dog.
Tension is a little too much for my 5LB chihuahua.
I like that it does not retract all the way to the clip.
Easy to lock and unlock the leash with one finger4.
It was not a pretty sight when I was trying to catch him while he was trying to run away from the clattering of the plastic casing.
I now twist it after I put it on my wrist to make it snug.Not sure I'd buy this again.
Pros:1.
Reflective strap.2.

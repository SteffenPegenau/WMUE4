My daughter is 6 years old now.
It was wonderful!
But it could not understand many of her 5 year old commands.
When he gets something wrong, I just say "Silly puppy.
The store was out of Fur Real parrots, so I gave Lucky a try.Wow!
Life isn't easy with a 6 year old but he hast stood up to these last few weeks wonderfully.
Educational points because trying to make him understand encourages my daughter to speak up and speak clearly.
Last year, she got a Fur Real parrot from Santa.
I am very impressed ...
And durrable points because ... well, lets face it.
He probably understands my commands near 75% of the time and my daughter's commands a little over 30% of the time.
I think he needs more training.
He broke and she requested another for Christmas.
(in fact, my voice was the only one that it could understand 90% of the time) ...
"I gave him fun points because he is fun.

Then there's her "friend" Sae who wants whatever Momo wants, Momo wants Toji so Sae wants Toji.
She likes a guy named Toji and a guy named Kiley likes her.
I mean they literally make you drool.Ahhh I love this series so much.
It's also so addicting, one of those books you can't put down till the end, and even when it's over you read it again and again.The art is also very noteworthy.
I really could not stop laughing.
( But where does poor Kiley fit in).
This is one funny manga.
It's one of those mangas where the guys are drawn really good.
What is the story about?
The character designs are some of the best I've ever seen.
So it basically sets off from there.
Read and enjoy.
I recommend it for anyone who likes a good story.
Basically a misunderstood highschool girl (momo) that everyone assumes is a easy party girl because of her looks.
Especially this first volume.
It is absolutely gorgeous.

Supernova; 18.
After the 'To Be Free' radio edit there is an additional 7 tracks: 15.
Tubular World.
It does not appear to be available through amazon.com, though.The disc was won on eBay and is made in Germany.
Let There be Light; 17.
Magellan; 19.
Unreservedly recommended.
Audio cd's can't handle more than 80-minutes so during the last track my cd player goes crazy and cuts the piece short.
The only complaint I have is that this bonus material causes the disc to run just over 80-minutes.
These last several tracks are mixed together and make up what is one gorgeous piece of music!
Oceania; and 21.
First Landing; 20.
In the Beginning; 16.
All in all this is a great cd and 'To Be Free', with his sister Sally handling the vocals, is an outstanding track.
The recording company needs to see that these selections go on a separate disc so they may be listened to in their entirety.
Mike Oldfield at his absolute best!

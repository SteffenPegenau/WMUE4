They are sending me a $60 check for my old microwave.
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
The microwave product might not be good but the service there was very good.
Told them what happened and I want to know what THEY are going to do about it.
They were very quick in getting back.
I read one other lady on here said the same thing.
!I wrote in to the Presto company.
So I thought that was fair.
All the popcorn popped but it also blew out my microwave and now it is dead and I have to buy a new one today!
You are not supposed to use it with this popper which I didn't.
Mine was a good one.
So followed the rules EXACTLY!
Read all the directions.
I bought this popper yesterday.
But I thought that maybe she already had a bad oven.
If they don't do anything I am getting in touch with the Better Business Bureau.Want to say I heard back from Presto.
It was 10 yrs.
Plus they are sending me a free hot air popcorn popper!
It also said to make sure your microwave has a popcorn button on it which mine did.
old.

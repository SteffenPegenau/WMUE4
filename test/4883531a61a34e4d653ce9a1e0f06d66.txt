What I really liked about this book is it's real funny.
So off to special - Ed he went.
He swallowed his house key.
This whole story is basically about kids that cause trouble.
Named Maria, but her dad wouldn't let Joey apologize because he thought Joey hurt her more.
So read the book.
It's really a great book to read if you don't like to get bored while reading a story.
Then Joey had to go to the doctors in Pittsburg to test his brain to see what new medicine he needed.
I liked to read about that kind of stuff.
Will he get to go back to his old school?The type of reader, who would like this book, is someone who likes to read about troublemakers.
People, who likes reading about fiction, I would this book to.
Mostly, because this story could have happened.
Because it makes me wonder what's going to happen next so it doesn't make me bored.Once there was a troublemaker named Joey.
Then cut off the tip of a girls nose.
I liked it because it was about a troublemaker.

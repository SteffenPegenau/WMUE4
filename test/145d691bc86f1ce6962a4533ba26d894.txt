What in the world?
I missed that, but still liked the book a great deal.
It is rich in Hollywood lore and names (yes, you need a knowledge of Hollywood history at some parts--but that is nice to see--an author who rewards her readers and doesn't dumb down her book).
She also discusses how much of a feminist book this was.
I liked all of it and knocked out in two days.
Finally, I did read on interview with Knode where she promises a sequel.
Got me.
The book is loaded with red herrings and odd characters.
A sequel?
I think I sort of figured something out, but frankly even with the "leave ya hanging" end, the book is much better than the average genre junk out there.
This book succeeds on a lot of levels.
Still, the ending puzzled the heck out of me.
The story was original and very film noir.
Happy?
Sad?

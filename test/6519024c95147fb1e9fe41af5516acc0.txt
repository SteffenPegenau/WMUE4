Dont get anrgy if your one of those that acctually cares about the story!
And to think...
The trees look like [...]!!!

I used to love you!!
Bungie you really let me down on this one!!
!did you even touch them?Level design: LAME!
And don't you dare charge for them!
Its just boring!
Only one I like is the Zanzibar rendition.
you better make it up with new, better levels in content download!!
WTF Bungie!
Maybe with time they will grow on me but I kinda doubt it.Campaign: same as halo 2, its nothing but practice for multiplayer!
Every halo has the same damn enemies and you do the same [...] over and over and over!All in all Im not impressed.
I had a 2 page review written but decided to sum it up.Graphics:Not impressed!!!

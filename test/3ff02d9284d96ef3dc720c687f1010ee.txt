But, she loves all of the doors to open, pouring coffee and the sounds on the main kitchen side.
Grill sound effects scared our 3 yr old daughter.
The holes are in incorrect places, so he had to make new holes for the screws and file other parts to get the screws to go in properly.
Read the instructions first completely!!!
Hubby had a hard time putting it together, probably 4 hours of work.
Especially before the knobs go on.
Otherwise, she likes it for the 2 days she's had it!
Little Tikes really needs to rethink/rewrite their instructions.
The little table and bench on the grill side is cute too.
She really doesn't like that part.
This is a pretty good set.
Then go back step by step and put it together to make sure everything makes sense.
We would buy this again, but put it together differently.
Hubby had to cut the stickers and piece them back together around the knobs.
Try to put the stickers on as you get it together.

The story is great!
What the heck happened I really don't know...
The plot.... well that has yet to be seen.
If I didn't mention it before, in the collection there is no ending.
The story is original and intresting.
I suggest you borrow or rent and if you like it buy it to add to your anime collection.
I finished watching the whole collection.
the last 2 eps completely ...!
Hey I'm still gonna get them cause I just have to know for sure.
Loved the characters and the animation.
Just so you know from what I hear the movies that are coming out still don't give you closure.
Leaves you completely hanging with some lame, abstract psycho babble in the last 2 eps, go figure!
Though the rest of the series minus the last 2 eps is really great.
I say it was worth getting the collection even though there was no ending and what ending it does have makes no sense.
Hopefully the 2 movies coming out will give some closure to the whole series.

This book gives a bit of background coverage so the children understand the times of the bible , the culture of the people that live in bible times so the children can connect the story.
Is so true to the bible and so doctrinally correct.
It is very simple and the language is very simple.
This way they can understand the message of the passage.
Many children stories are so off and don't mach the real Bible .
I love it.
Also can be used to introduce someone to the bible .
I love it.
The book doesn't have a lot of pictures but the text is incredible.
It is amazing.
It can also be used as teaching material in a sunday school class.
I have 3 children(8-11).
I highly recommend it
Their message is confusing .
Anyone can understand it.
I have been a sunday school teacher for over 20 years.
This book is the best bible story book I have ever read for children that are 6 and older.

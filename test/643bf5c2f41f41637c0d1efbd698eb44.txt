But this one was awesome!
This is where this dvd only got 4 stars.
I usually hate most animes.
This dvd is gorgeous, funny, suspenseful, and it only gets better as the series continues.
I love this series.
Almost everyone i have shown this dvd to has not told me otherwise.
If you buy this dvd, i highly recomend watching it with subtitles in japanese.
It isnt constant hilarity, but you will laugh at least once or thrice.
Yes, I said funny!
I saw it on Tech tv once and instantly bought it through this site.
The American voice acting is suprisingly worse than usual.
Buy now!
And the original japanese script is much less corny.
The visuals are great too.
Granted the first volume is the worst, but still great.
This anime is also actually funy!
most of the action sequences involve gorgeous computer generated visulas that blend almost perfectly with the actual animation.

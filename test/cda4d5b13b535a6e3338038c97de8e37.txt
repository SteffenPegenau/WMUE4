Takes five to sometimes twenty minutes to find satellites sometimes.
No major problems yet.Cons: Battery dies fast if not plugged in.
**ADDED Comment: Another Con I seems to have found is, the GPS sometimes freezes up on me.
After 6 months, its still running well as it did when I bought it.
Even with the new software download, some roads are not on the GPS.

Had no problems getting around with it.
Comes with a windshield mount and a case.
I would def.
After restarting it, it works fine.Overall a 4/5 because of non updated maps, and battery life.
Battery when full might last 2 hours.
Pros: Touch screen works great.
No directions needed to use.
**ADDED Comment: Another Pro!
This is very rare, but since I use this GPS 3-6 times every day, after about 6 months it froze up 5 times.

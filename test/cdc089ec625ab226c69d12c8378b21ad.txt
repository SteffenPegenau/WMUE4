I had owned Shure E3s, but lost them.
However, Shure has a number of great ideas that Etymotic missed out on.
When wearing the Etymotics I scream "I'm a fool with wierd headphones, someone mug me for my ipod".
Their earphones conform around the ear, not stick out making you look like an idiot.
They're both the same price, go buy the E3.
Now I'm selling the Etymotics and buying another pair of Shure's.
The big difference is excess noise.
This time I decided to try Etymotic's competing earphones, the ER-4P.
Everytime you turn your head the cables bump your shirt collar, and loud vibrations offend your ear drums.I tried each for six months.
When the cable is bumped, the sound travels to the snug point and dies, never reaching your ears.
With the Shure's no one even noticed I had headphones on.
The Etymotic cables just dangle.
Sure, the sound is good, but it's good on the E3s as well.
The Shure's fit snugly around the back of your head.
Bad Idea.

Waste of time.
!
I'm not usually one to write reviews but this was bad enough I felt the need to warn others.
It took a lot of carefulness over each bump and they still fell off.
Hard to explain if you haven't seen the product, but basically if one connector came off there were up to 6 parts to collect.
Waste of money.
Big disappointment.
Going over a bump in the sidewalk or making a simple turn and the connectors popped off.
We walked one block and one connector fell off.
The rubber pads also fell out--one wasn't even in place when I took it out of the package.
Plus it required both hands at all times when pushing.
This doesn't work!!
I don't know how this has as good of reviews as it does because it was a total disaster.
And this wasn't an occasional event.
We turned around then and by the time we were almost back the other two had come off as well so I ended up leaving one kid and walking them back individually.

I preferred having mine fixed.
It won't print photos anymore.
Soon afterwards, I had various problems with the refurbished replacement but it kept working for about 9 months.
I usually like HP products but not this one.
They are no longer the HP company I've purchased from for years.
Had to admit I was disappointed in HP's service for their AIO line.
It now won't scan anything and to make multiple copies, I need to power down and power up the machine before making multiple copies.
I will only purchase separate printing components from now on.
No more AIO printers for me.
The only thing it does is print from my computer.
I called HP service who told me I am out of warranty.
No thanks.
HP immediately replaced it which was not what I wanted.
Instead, they sent me a refurbished 3310.
I purchased the 3310 new, used it 6 months and it stopped scanning and copying.
Their answer was for me to trade this one in on the purchase of a refurbished, newer AIO model.

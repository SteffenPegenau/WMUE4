Some chapters are better than others.
How can the author of this book know how Marilyn felt in the different situations?
If Marilyn was alive, and could retell her story, then it would be great.
I know it is a novel, and not a biography.
But this is based on facts about her life, and the rest seems like guesswork.
That doesn't give you more knowledge of her life.
I would not recommend this book for anyone.
It showed her addiction to sex and sedatives.
It doesn't live up to it's high expectations, and you don't get any closer to the truth.
Buy another book!
But when you her that this is the story about her behind the glamour, you expect a lot.
But you have to wonder, what's the truth and what's not?
But once the author repeats herself over and over again in what is supposed to be a poem written by Norma Jean, it is awful.
I bought this book because I read that this was supposed to be the truth about Marilyn Monroe's life.
And I wasn't impressed by the result.

What was I thinking when I picked this one up?
There is some fake blood to be sure, but you never actually see what happens.
Horrible script (I guess they had a script), bad acting, laughable special effects and music that was probably from the cutting room floor of 'The Exorcist.'
Run, and forget you ever heard of this movie.
Stare at a blank TV screen for an hour and a half.
What were they thinking when they made this?
I was kind of happy when that annoying Professor Esterbrook got killed.
There was one good thing though.
Even if you're into mindless violence or gore or gratuitous nudity..Pass on this.
There is none.
Don't watch it.
It was just bad.
There is no excuse for a film this bad.
Anything.
I say, move on and find something else to watch.
Okay, I'm done beating on this sick dog.
I don't know what to say about this film.
Man, she was abnoxious.
What are you thinking reading a review of this piece of crap?

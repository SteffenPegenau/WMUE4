Their marked for 5+ but i would say it was more for 7 to 10.
Yet kids also seem to get bored with them after a week or so.
The actual bean is very sturdy.
They have big plans for this line of products, and this is only the first series.
So it will keep them busy for hours.
which makes them perfect for collecters.
I would say it is more for collecters than children.
Cause a little kid is not going to care if something is collectible or not.
Some are worth more than others.
The Mighty Beanz from Spin Masters are a very intresting toy indeed.
Yet kids do have quite a time watching them roll and bounce around.
Yet the same cannot be said for the character print which is easily scraped and torn away.
...
Thats not all either they also come with a guide of games to play with them.
Each marked with a character print.
Each set has six beanz.
Holding up to lots of play.
So I am not sure how long this item will last on the market.

And that's what I like about it.
The game begins when you enter your house and you notice that your furniture is toppled and torn and your pictures are knoked down.
Not to mention your dead wife and kid.
Big levels to wander.
Vengeful Max goes to see his only friend at the subway.
It's different from any first person shooter game I ever played.
This game is amazing!
Cool aint it!
The sound and graphics are great.
And the violence is strong perfet for all you die hard fans.
Now you have the mob and the Feds after you.
Be sure to check it out.
But a nuff about what I think, let me tell you about the plot.
But as soon as you get there and meet him your friend gets a brain wheggie before you can say "hi pal".
Well that pretty much it and the rest you'll have to find out for your self.PS= If you liked this review I'm doing one on Clive Barker's Undying soon.
It's a cool game for all you action-science fiction gamers.

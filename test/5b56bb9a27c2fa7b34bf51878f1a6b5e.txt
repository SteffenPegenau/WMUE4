!
The 1st, and now the 2nd, do not work!
This is by far the WORST crib mobile I have ever had!
FP needs to improve on product quality...to say the least!!
I am D O N E with FP!
I am sending this mobile back and never purchasing another product from Fisher-Price!
(As a NICU RN I have worked with many babies who had crib mobiles.)
Brand new batteries...and the mobile will not function!
The same batteries work in the cradle swing...
I followed the directions to the 'T'...and the music sounds as if it is dying...and the motor worked for all of 2 seconds (with both #1 and #2)!
No motor function!
This is my 2nd mobile of this make and model.
No music!
Now on my 2nd mobile (bc I returned the 1st)...and this mobile does not even work..AT ALL!
My daughter is 3 months old and we are on our 2nd FP cradle swing...and 2 mobiles later...

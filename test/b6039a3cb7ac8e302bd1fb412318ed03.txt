She grew up in tough times with much racism.
She fails to see that she has a racist point of view of whites.
My main problem is the book has no ending or point.
Why is having the baby a happy ending to this book.
She tries to get acroos themes but it fails.
13 movies in school.
This book to me a waste of time.
I don't think this is an appropriate book for kids to be forced to read.
Kids can't watch some P.G.
It had no significant ending.
16.
If I were to do that I would be dead.
Some details in the scene from St. Louis did not needed to be added.
She only sees whie hating blacks.
Maya does a good job writing this book but there is no point.
I consider this writing to be rated P.G.
And how is ruuning away to the junkyard a good idea.
In my point of views it just made her life go downhill.

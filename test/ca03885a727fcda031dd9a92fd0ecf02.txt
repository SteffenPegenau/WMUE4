Ring tones are terrible.
Cons:1.
(MD481 can)4.
While listening to messages, CallerID does not show caller's info (again because answering system is a totally separate unit.7.
Handset doesn't show that you have new messages in the answering machine (MD481 shows it)5.
Can't check answering mailboxes through handsets.
Handsets and the Base do not share Phonebooks.
Surprisingly this model lost many features from its predecessor MD481.
(MD481 has better choices)Pros:1.
(MD481 can)6.
Has a battery compartment for the base too for power outages.3.
Answering Machine is totally separate from the system.3.
Great microphones and speakerphones on handsets and base.
I first bought the MD481 model but had to return it twice to Motorola and finally gave me this MD681 "upgraded" model.
Good voice quality2.
(MD481 has some failures with the answering machine system)2.

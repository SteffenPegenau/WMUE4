I have bought many refurbished items, never had a serious issue with any of them.
They are both going back.
The instructions state you need to plug it into charge for 7 hours for a full charge.
I gave this item 1 star because I couldn't give it zero.
If you are anthing like me, you like to buy refurbished products.
I think the folks that have not had an issue with this item are an execption.
This has been more trouble than it's worth.
I never even got to try either one.
That means that the battery was fully discharged.
The first was broken right out of the box.
The second seemed fine until I plugged it into charge.
I thought I wouldn't have an issue.
I know it's tempting @ this price, resist.
I ordered two at the same time.
I had it plugged in for 24 hours & the red light never stopped blinking.

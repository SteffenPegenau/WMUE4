One thing is for sure.
R Kelly is timeless, and TP-2 is about as R Kelly as R Kelly can get.
It is that good.
He is the modern Bach or Chopain of R&B.
There are probably 10 songs out of 19 on this album that you could listen to three times back to back and still want more.
I have been spoiled listening to R Kelly so much that other R&B artists just don't do it for me anymore.
There is only one R Kelly.
"Strip for You" and "One Me" are sure panty droppers if you want to set the mood.
If you play this for your woman she will definitely love you more.
I am hard pressed to find someone that doesn't like R Kelly.
The other 9 are excellent as well, though 3-4 are definitely catered towards slower music for women.
His talent makes all these other wanna be artists pale in comparison.
There is only one artist I could listen to everyday, and that's R Kelly.
R Kelly is a music/love machine.
If you like any song from R Kelly, you'll love this album.

Most of the girls are fake looking, which is something I don't normally like, but it wasn't too bad.
The last part of the video is this guy trying to pick up on the host.
I was laughing out loud because he gets her to flash him.
The host doesn't "hook up", but she does flash.
They still looked good in spite of this.
It's like a "Blind Date" episode, except they get the participants in the buff during the interview segment.
The cover is slightly misleading.
Fantastic!
It's the same deal here.
I guess it's something.This is a fairly good pick for about $13.
She detests him but tries to be polite and let him down easy.
It was fairly good, but there weren't any explicit shots.
I would compare it with a Cinemax late-night feature.
The second date is with a guy and girl.
The first date is with two girls.

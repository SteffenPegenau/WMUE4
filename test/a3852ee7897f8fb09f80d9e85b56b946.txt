I have taken the brilliant with the not so brilliant and I have taken them happily.
Here's what happens...
I press play and after 2 minutes I am laughing so hard I have to stop the disc.
It is utter bile.
This record defies categorization.
Really.
I would honestly rather listen to Union on repeat mode for a week than having to sit through Relayer once.
I have been a GIANT Yes fan since for nearly 30 years.
But I will not take Relayer.
The most nonsensical, masturbatory, overblown recording they ever made.
I do not make such criticism lightly.
I even bought the remaster.
Ok, after reading this onslaught of glorious reviews I cannot remain silent.
Try another track, laughter turns into complete disbelief.
I have, on many occaisions, attempted to re-evaluate the album.

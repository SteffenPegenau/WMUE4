Voices are fabulous - which is typical of the Nylons during this period.
For a second Nylons CD get "One Size Fits All".
.
If you are looking for more of the same on this album unfortunately what you get is a shadow of the incredible vocal work capable of this group.Recommended for Nylons fans (like me) but if you have never bought a Nylons CD buy "Happy Together" and get blown away.
Ten songs.
The arrangements are very creative but .
and then tend to forget about it.
There are some good songs but overall this album seems out of focus.I was spoiled by "Happy Together" which I think was their best album.
.
You'll wonder why this group never became all that popular.
About 30 minutes of top quality rock-a-pella.
.
Those are my recomendations.
this album doesn't leave me singing the tunes in my head.
.
Some good, some forgetable.
I walk away thinking, "Wow that was really well done" .

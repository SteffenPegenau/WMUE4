TheDividers are awful and cheaply made.
If you have never had a train case before you will like it.
The advert said it was worth $80.
It is however a very large box.
Where are my bottom dividers.
Not love it.
I am a little disappointed in the case.
The felt is peeling.
It okay.
BULL!
The aluminum is scratched.
Where is the strap and keys.
I will not purchase another.
Just poorly constructed in my opinion.
The glue is showing.

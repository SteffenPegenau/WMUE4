NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!!!!!!

AND HORRIBLY there are going to create another one of these monstrosities.
which is fine if this didn't have the misssion impossible NAME ON IT.
Even worse the whole idea of fighting bad guys has to always include the american government.
Mission impossible is about a TEAM of professionals who go after the enemies of america.
he's good but these movies are a disgrace.
Instead it's a lone action hero, if this was called "man impossible" then I might give it a break.
I do like cruise.
?It's not related to mission impossible.
The plot is thin which I could forgive if this wasn't a HIGH budget movie.
This movie and the rest are abominations that even Tom cruise can't save.
It's excrement though as a movie; that is based on a good premise that is not here barely.
who can't be killed of course.
let me guess, evil americans are out to get tom cruise.
And of course there is no team in this movie.

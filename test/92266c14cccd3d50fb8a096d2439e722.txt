Signed, sealed, delivered (7:00)3.
Rising (4:27)9. drums control (4:42)10.
Track times:1. burnin up (5:55)2.
And once again, there could have been longer cuts.
Track 1-4 just slams you over the head with hardhouse vocal gems.
21st century (6:15)6.
And then we get back to powerful vocal starting Saving My Soul...pretty poor programming if you ask me.
Just when things should be climbing to even higher heights, the mix crashlands with 3 boring instrumentals!!!
But that NRG is ruined too soon by a boring drum track.
Maula (5:50)7.
But Elle Patrice saves the day with the incredible track Rising.
Things finish off with 2 more vocal anthems.
Power (5:13)4.
Madreselva (5:24)8.
So overall, this is a pumpin mix, with just a small number of useless tracks that slow things down a bit.
Saving my soul (6:47)11. red heels studio (4:10)12. desert sands (5:22)
The walk of shame (6:30)5.

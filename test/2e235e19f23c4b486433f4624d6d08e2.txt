This is demonstrated by the t.v.
This is a good cerebral story.
As I understand it, it was to be the pilot of a new series.
If you haven't seen the director's cut you are missing out.
type story.
The director's edtion is definitely an improvement.
If you just thought it meandered too much, give this version a try.
I think you will enjoy it.
It is still better that Trek V or any of the TNG movies.
Okay, I admit that I love this movie because it was the first.
episode than a movie, but at the time there was not series.
That said, it would still have made a better t.v.
If you never liked the movie give this version a try.
It really explores ideas that are out there.
It is still long and slow, but now it is a little tighter.
Not as tedious.

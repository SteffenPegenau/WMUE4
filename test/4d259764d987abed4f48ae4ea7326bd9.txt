And Bubba couldn't flow to it.
Those are my favorite kind of beats.
A white, southern rapper for that matter, Bubba did exceptionally well.
that was the hottest track on the album.
Some of those Twista like beats Bubba just couldn't do it.
The beats on the album were tight.
came in and completely killed it.
They need to get together and do something cause they make a pretty good duo.Overall: For a southern rapper.
Most of the time when I give out a three, I go out and criticize albums.
He definitely out-shined Bubba there.
However out of the whole CD, the only song I could really listen to was Regardless wit him and C.I.
By next album, he will be near flawless.
Some of the beats Bubba rapped too, he didnt do it right.
Another thing, is that he talks about Betty too much.
But in this case, there was a lot of ups to this album.
It gets freakin annoyin after a while.
I only had one problem which made me give it a three.
Bubba's flow was pretty much good.
C.I.
Damn.

The trials Oliver goes through in this book really make you think.
Now I truly know why he is such a great author.
Once I had read the book, I was surprised at how much I liked it!
I guess I kind of saw it coming though since Sikes seems as if he has it in him.
I give 5 stars to Dickens for writing this novel.
I was disappointed by Mr. Bumble.
Everyone should experience this book!
I picked this book up at my local library for a book report.
He treated Oliver as if he weren't human.
He has made me an admirer of his books.
Since I am 14, I didn't expect to really enjoy this book, but I had heard so much about it so I decided to read it.
I could not put this book down.
I was surprised by the murder.
All in all, I enjoyed the characters.
There were numerous occasions where I kept wondering what would happen next.

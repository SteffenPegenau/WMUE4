Perfect execution.
I crave music games, and there have never been enough good ones.
If this describes you, look no further.
Easy for new players.
"Parappa the Rapper" more or less defined the genre, but I didn't find it terribly satisfying.Then Harmonix brought us "Frequency", and it was very interesting.
Multiplayer modes (both online and offline) are fabulous.

Or maybe you're just looking for something different.
Or maybe you've tried "Guitar Hero", developed by the same brilliant folks, and want more of the same sort of genius.
I've been a long-time fan of the "Beatmania"/"Hip Hop Mania" arcade series.
This game is serious, unique fun.Maybe you're holding out hope for a music-oriented game that doesn't leave you disappointed.
Smashing graphics.
Great songs.
Unbelievably challenging for experienced players.
Yet something intangible was missing from the gameplay.Then came Amplitude, a sequel to Frequency.

Thank you!)
It is so shiny and round, and the picture on the cover is such fine art.
My record sales are down which is why I am so poor!
But I've still heard it.
Maybe not, but in the world of brilliant music this cd makes the grade.
I cant though since I'm very poor.
The music is fun and happy.
Will you please buy this for me?!
Im addicted to this band.
It is very cool.
I love it.
I need it, I am so deprived.
Sometimes it can be nice though.
(PS_While you're at it will you please buy some of my cds?
I would buy it if I could.
It is good stuff, this music.
In the cd, though, is the music and it is even better than the cd case...which is made from such fine plastic!
Music is fun, and this cd is music!
Its also sad and mean.

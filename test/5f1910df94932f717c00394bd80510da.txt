Mavrikis???
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, proven by how quickly I was able to finish.
Looking forward to the next book.
Could there perhaps be a sequel Ms.
So many people were involved in the plot which made it even more intriguing.
At the end of the book, I wished there were more.
Absolutely riveting!!!
Once I reached midpoint, I found myself racing through the chapters, hungry for more.
Never could I have imagined the twist of events that occurred.
I read this book in three days.
I hope we don't have to wait too long.
She began with a good foundation and built up to a climatic ending!
I could not put it down!
The author certainly has a captivating style.
Thank you Ms. Mavrikis.
As I started reading the first few chapters, I became curious as to the outcome.
Excellent!!

As soon as you see it for real, you will only see a big chunk of greenish plastic.
You won't at least be fooled in front of other friends like me.
NO!!
NO!!
Not recommended at all.
You are making a mistake.
Also green color only looks good on small sized pics as on the description on web.
GREAT!"
Spend $20~$40 more, and get SONY or Panasonic.
Although this player do offer 40-sec ESP, you should also think about battery life.
Unlike Sony's 32~64 hours/2 batt life, this drinks up batteries like gatorades.
NO!!
I bought this for a gift to a friend.
I know what you are thinking.
"40-sec ESP, Cool Green Colors, and CHEAP!

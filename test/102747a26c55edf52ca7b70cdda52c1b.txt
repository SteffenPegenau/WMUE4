DON'T buy this game, DON'T rent it, if you see it in a store window TURN AWAY AS AFAST AS YOU CAN AND RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!!
Yet again, nintendo killed another great series.
This game SUCKS.
A LOT!
Sounds good......NO!
In this game you collect myrrh (or however its spelled) to restore the tree and protect you yadda yadda yada.
**** this game.
SNES was great it had awsome games...after N64 came out... in my opinion...Nintendo will go the way of the Dreamcast...
Nintendo is going downhill.
See, I thought that when Nintendo released FFCC...that it would be GOOD.
IT WASNT!
I replayed it 5 times since once u restore the trees power you have to go out and do it again (I got up to year 5) and i said to myself....you know what?!!?
You have to pretty much replay the game OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
WELL GUESS WHAT!!?!?!?
IT SUCKS!!

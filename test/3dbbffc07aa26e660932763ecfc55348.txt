They can be huge - up to 90MB.All in all I am happy with the unit.
It is fragile.
The weakness is in the feeder mechanism.1.
But, it does work.6.
If you are quick you can tap the corner that is sticking up and it will feed ok.5.
It lacks the sophistication and ease of use we Mac users have come to expect.
Do not force it.3.
Occasionally a slide will hang up on insertion.
Their phone help is very fast and is good.7.
Dump he tray that came with it.
I still have hundreds of slides to go.
Don't save the images as TIFF.
You need to keep an eye on it to catch potential jams.8.
The Mac software us obviously ported (poorly) from the PC version.
I have scanned over 300 cardboard mounted slides with minimal problems using their DIN 108 tray.4.
The bottom corner catches.
Won't even feed plastic slides well, Get their Universal Slide Tray (or any DIN 108 tray).
It does a fine job of scanning and correcting 35mm slides.
Unfortunately it is not ""fire and forget."

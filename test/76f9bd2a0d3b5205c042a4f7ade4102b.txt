But Erick loved her, too.
At last, Erick disappeared, and nobody knew where Christine and Raoul were.
So, everyone doesn't love him.
He is a very poor person.
Erick's face is very ugly.
Raoul fell in love with her.
Eric proposed to her.
Christine was a good singer.
I think mystery and opera fans would like this story.
She said, "Yes.
The main characters are Eric(phantom), Raoul and Christine.
I love you, Erick " and kissed to him.
This story is a mystery and love story, so I like this story very much.
In the beginning two people were killed by the phantom, because they talked about him or didn't listen to advice.
He was very glad and said, "You are free."

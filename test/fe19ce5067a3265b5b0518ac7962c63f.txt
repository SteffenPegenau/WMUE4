I ordered it to only find that it wouldn't turn on without a charger cord.
NEED TO KNOW if you buy this product.
I contacted the seller and explained the problem.
I work with electronics and can solder a new battery on.
The battery might not work and Windows 7 doesn't work on it.
I loved my old palm and wanted one to replace it.
The seller gave a credit for it and I gave him a very positive rating.
The seller granted me a full refund or the price of a battery on amazon.
This shows that the battery is at fault.
Most palms that set for a long time have battery failure.
Other than that, I would order another palm tungsten e , when the need arises.
This seller was really good at communicating what had gone wrong.
I knew that the item was questionable because it has been discontinued for years.
I knew this from experience.
I ordered a NEW palm Tungsten E in a sealed box.

I'm pleased with this purchase.
All the holes and parts matched up perfectly, so no trouble there.
Easy to assemble, put it together in about 30 minutes (that's pretty good considering I usually take hours to put anything together).
Great product for the price.
The only thing stopping it is a little wooden peg that you insert into the top portion of the table.
The tables seem very sturdy, not wobbly at all.
Bought 2 of these.
I wasn't expecting anything spectacular.
I'm not picky.
The drawer rests on and uses a couple of wooden boards rather than a rolling track.
When pulled out it tilts downward like it could fall out.
The tables work well next to my bed, perfect height.
The only thing that's kind of rickety is the drawer.
The tabletop had a few scratches on it, but nothing I really care about.
This is fine considering I paid about $70 for a pair.

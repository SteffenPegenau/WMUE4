I have only one complaint about it.
I saw it when I was shopping one day and I just had to have it for him.
Love this toy!!!!
He absolutely loves it!
It goes through batteries like crazy.
I highly recommend this soother to everyone!
It went with us on vacation last summer to make Ben feel at home.
We take it with us to the babysitter's house and to grandma's house.
I bought this cute little soother for my little boy Ben when he was 6 weeks old.
!
He is now 17 months old and it has become such a big part of his bedtime and naptime routine.
I will definitely give it to someone as a shower gift.
I guess it could be from Ben turning it on and off so much!
It goes every place Ben spends the night.
We turn it on first thing when he goes to bed, and when it shuts off, he turns it back on himself.
I don't know what we would do if we didn't have Pooh!

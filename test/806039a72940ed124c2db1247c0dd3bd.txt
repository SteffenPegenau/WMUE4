its great and quick.
GOOD LUCK
Sometimes with my schedule its hard to get to the gym so I tried her DVDs and they work!
I have been slowly getting back to doing hard core aerobics and have even managed to have less back pain bc my core is firmer and my knees and legs ache less due to my weight loss.
I usually do level 2 or 3 (trying to get to 4) and then I combine this with six pack abs.
Others that are good are 6 week six pack abs, no more trouble zones, and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism!
She is not the easiest trainer.
You honestly do not need the gym with Julian Michaels DVD's.
U do not need a gym or lots of money to be in shape.
I highly recommend this to those that do not make excuses and are willing to put the work.
I am in decent shape, but due to previous back surgery and medications I gained tons of weight.
Its not easy.
Try this DVD.
If you are a beginner def start with week one and continue doing week one until you can do week two.
I absolutely love this DVD.

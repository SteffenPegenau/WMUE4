You will regret optimum nutrition after trying body fortress though.
I would recommend staying away from optimum nutrition.
I really don't see why this has such high ratings.
You won't regret it.
I have been doing so for quite a few years.
The best protein I have tried to date is by far Body Fortress Super Advanced Whey Protein.
You can get a 2 pound container for only $15 at Walmart or several other stores/sites.
During my time trying different proteins, this has to be the worst yet.
I take protein after ever workout every day.
If you don't believe me, just try Body Fortress yourself.
The price is much better, it contains everything optimum has plus more more recovery supplements already in it.
The price for this crap is terrible!
It feels much more filling and tastes far better.
I exercise at least an hour every day.
It's a complete ripoff.

.
this is part of another series involving supposedly zany characters that are involved in what might be called a romantic mystery (a newspapereditor adds a new personals section, then finds that its readers are getting killed) .
.
.
.
I've generally enjoyed the comic mysteries of Janet Evanovich, featuring bounty hunter Stephanie Plum .
.
so when I had the opportunity to listen to FULL BLAST by the author andCharlotte Hughes, I decided to give it a try .
I felt little for any of the characters, nor did the narration by Lorelei King do very much for me .
.
.
.
.
what I likedbest about FULL BLAST actually had nothing to do with the story .
.
I liked it very much and just wish that it had been longer.
.
at the very end, there was a brief interview of Janet Evanovich about how she goes about her daily writing .

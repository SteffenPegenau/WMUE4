All I can state, is that he or she must fall a lot.
Used it to glue a piece from a picnic table.
Tell me, what planet are you talking about?
Then it was tough like a gorilla.
Piece fell off.
!Seen advertisement with the gorilla hanging on to piece that is "suppose" to be glued.
Do not know what planet this gorilla came from?
I used it on metal.
Oh, but it left behind, hard glue on what it was suppose to adhere to.
Has not stuck to anything.
Now, I have to get something to take that off.Opening the bottle was difficult.
That it sticks to!!!!!
My gorilla was the weakest gorilla on my planet.
It fell off.
Oh, yes and it will stick if you do not clean the tip of bottle, the cover will stick to it.

I watched this movie with my dad.
I watched it because Dakota Fanning,the best actress,was in it.
I think if you let a child watch this they should be at least 10 or 11.
I really liked this movie.
You should watch this movie sometime.
He didn`t care for it so much because he doesn`t like these kinds of movies.
This movie was very well done.
!Dakota Fanning ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!
I hate bloody movies,but i saw this movie.
It rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I couldn`t watch the whole thing because i was frightened of the events that were happening and when the next scene of blood would be.
I just saw it.
I got it for my 10th birthday.
It was full of action and it was really cool.
I liked it.

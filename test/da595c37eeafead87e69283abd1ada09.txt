Take it slowly!
The translations are done in correct english so you understand and many times as word for word translations as well so you develop a sense of word order (also VERY important).
Every unclear detail is explained in notes at the bottom of the page so you're never lost.
You can't get around that!
There's a lot to learn!
Being objective, the lessons can be a bit much towards the middle.
English and Hungarian have almost NOTHING in common.
The tapes do an impeccable job of helping you grasp the phonetics and intonations (VERY important).
It will come.
Text is practical, realistic and USEFUL!
Let's face it....Hungarian isn't easy!
Grammar is introduced gradually so as to not overwhelm the student.
it's the next best thing to having a private tutor!
We can't really relate it to other languages (unless you speak Finnish...yeah right!!)
But if you are ready to learn, Assimil does a great job of unravelling this puzzle which is Hungarian.

You can only have so many people who hate each other before it starts to get old.
Unfortunately, I fear that it is beyond salvaging.
Of course it didn't help that everyone in the movie was slightly insane.
Who on earth would get a target imprinted into their skull?
Who kills people with paper clips and playing cards?
It has a guardian devil."
How enthralling.
The only thing that made it slightly more tolerable was the soundtrack.
In a nutshell, the plot was everybody getting revenge on everyone else.
Who wears pleather leggings?
So we went to see it in theatres.
Excellent music, but the plot and acting in the movie were definitely lacking.
Big, big mistake.
This show needs some serious help.
When we saw the ads for Daredevil on TV, we thought "Wow, what a cool movie!"
"This city doesn't need a guardian angel.
Oh the drama!
And then the closing line.

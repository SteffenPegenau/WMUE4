But I felt a grave dissapointment in Atrus.
A good book.
Atrus gives the very strong impression of being the worst thing possible.
Atrus seemed to become "whacked out" with luxury and humanitarianism.
Nevertheless, this is a good end to the trilogy.
I'll stick with Veovis and Gehn.
Who milks the cows?
He proves this in the first book of the trilogy.
Oh!
At least at first.
Atrus is a hard-edged "scientist".
But he probably didn't want to hurt his feelings!
And Atrus certainly should have deeply questioned that old man who wanted the book burned immediately.
A, well, "liberal Democrat".
(sarcasm).
Even Catherine knew that something was amiss when they entered this age.
But let's face facts.
If you find an age that is Utopia, would you not ask why the food magically appears?

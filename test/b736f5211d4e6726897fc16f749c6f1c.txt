Good range on sizes.
Like by adding an dangling ear or wiggling tail.
Very nice, clear, colorful and full or almost full page photos of the knitted products.
The thing I really love about this book is the photos.
This is the book you want.
But it's all about the colors together with those cute motifs.
Mostly just knit stitch.
Very colorful, cute and cheerful for baby.
Frankily, the designs of the sweaters are really nothing special.
Good for beginners.
Perhaps that's what making these very simple and ordinary designs so attractive.
And she gives a little life and texture to the animals motifs.
She group the book into 3 main chapters by color - pastel, neutral and the brights.
If you are looking for cute animal patterns like rabbit, cow, griffle, duckie, etc and trains and boat kind of stuff in simple design.
Just Simple pullover or cardigan set with blankets, hats etc.

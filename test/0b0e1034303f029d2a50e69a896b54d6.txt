But his encounters are true to life.
Even the "nasty" ones.
I'm sure he has more talent!
The person that told him to make it light, was not doing him a favor.
And you imagine that he'll be drugging and cruising sometime in the near future.
This memoir is so shallow after all that is said and done.
Well, maybe the fact that he's ageing and balding will put the brakes on that notion!
Having been in many of the situations that Rick Whitaker has been in, I can honestly say that I'm disappointed.
I'll give him that.
The only interesting character in this book is a guy named Francisco, who actually likes the men he sleeps with.
A book about Francisco's hustling experiences would be more compelling in my view.
Rick's character is as aimless as his writing.
This memoir makes him look like a used up complainer with no depth of soul.
Hey, Rick, if you ever read this, send me an email.
We both have father issues!
By the end of his story, you feel little for him.

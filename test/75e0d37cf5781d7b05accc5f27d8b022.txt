I have heard of Nan, but not Nanny.
But that was never mentioned.
And, why did everyone but the X family have real surnames?I also didn't like the vulgar language and profanity throughout the book.
I heard great reviews about this book.
At least she got a puppy out of the deal.For good reading about the nanny profession, I recommend White House Nannies.
After reading it, I don't understand what all the hoopla was about.
Perhaps, for her life, it was a foreshadowing.
The character names were strange.
I just was not very impressed with the book.
Her mother was a lawyer, so she might want to have her sue for back wages.
I mean, who names their child "Nanny?"
While it isn't a bad book, it's certainly not a great one, either.
She was a hoot!What I didn't understand was Nanny never stood up to Mrs. X.
The best character was Nanny's grandmother.
The story itself was all right.

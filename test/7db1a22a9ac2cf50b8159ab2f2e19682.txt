Instead of taking a hard earned vacation and coming back refreshed, Elton and Bernie went to the well one too many times.
Victim Of Love and Leather Jackets vie for that title.
Thoroughly uninspired on every level.
Would've made a great single.
I still hate it in '12.
The only positive is that Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson were spared from wasting their time playing this rubbish.
I hated this when I bought it brand new in '76.
"Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word" and maybe, "One Horse Town".
He did not heed that warning.
When you're around for 40+ years you're gonna make a stinker or two and this was first but not worst.
This was Elton's first warning that the drugs weren't such a good thing.
It didn't age well.
The blood is also on Gus Dudgeon's hands too.
I will never understand why a band that has Davey Johnstone in it has a zero like the ever embarrassing Ray Cooper so much up front in the mix.
The rest is tepid pablum.

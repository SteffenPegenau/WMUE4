Picked up the occupied trap and the cat started hissing and spitting at me.
That's not supposed to happen!
He charged the door end of the trap hard and...HE WAS FREE AND RUNNING.
I set the trap down to calm him down, when all of a sudden...it happened!!!
He'll never go back in that thing again.
I had a trapped cat.
But, then when I started carrying him to my truck for a 10 mile ride to a new home, he started charging both ends of the the trap.
Within 15 minutes, BAM!
I had that sucker and now he's gone for good.
I want my money back!!
WTF!
Had a stray coming through my doggie door and eating all my cat's food and pissing on my furniture, so when my new trap showed up I put it right to work.
That was too easy.
Followed the instructions for assembly and grabbed a can of tuna.

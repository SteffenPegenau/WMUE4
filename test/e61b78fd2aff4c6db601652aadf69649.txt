Own this unit more than 2 years.
As always, monitor your battery voltage after sundown and battery has "rested" for proper state of charge.
My wife thinks I am a battery freak!
Wish I could hook another panel to it though.
So far, so good, with this unit as I would expect from this company.
I use it for a service truck AGM (non-leaking/sealed) battery hooked to a power inverter 12 to 120 volt.
Yes, I own this Battery Minder product too!
Then installed control unit next to my inverter inside of camper shell.
Unit works well and no problems to date.
Unit came with a quick reference unit for state of voltage/charge.Daniel
I bolted the solar panel to the top of my camper shell.
Manufacturer says you should not connect more solar panels.
Maybe I am!!
It is quite durable.
But I could always use another charge controller to add on another solar panel addition.

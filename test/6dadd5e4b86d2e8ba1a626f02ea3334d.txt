I'll do my best here ...."Whiney, corporate-created Top 40 pop-rock.
Linkin Park.
Simple power chords, simple drumming, simple bass, et cetera.
Linkin Park is talentless.
Christ man.
The only band member with some promise is Bennington.
Learn to write something else.
He actually has a decent voice.
I mean how many songs can a band write that goes Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Break, Chorus.
The rest of them blow.
"That about does it.
And for the love of God, please stop whining about how bad your relationships are, how no one loves you, how you can't go on, and so on.And to whoever is classifying this band as metal, please, educate yourself a little more thoroughly.By the way, the only reason this thing got 2 stars (and that's stretching it) is because of "Lying From You."
I can actually tolerate that song.
How can I describe these guys?
Indescribably simple songwriting.

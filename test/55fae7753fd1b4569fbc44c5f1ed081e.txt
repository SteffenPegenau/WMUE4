Perhaps in another five years, yet ANOTHER reboot will get pumped out with lots of CGI and 3D effects for the mass to eat up.
Well, at least that alone gave me a good laugh.
Peter slamming his alarm clock and smashing it into pieces was most likely the ONLY hilarious part of the ENTIRE flick.
I won't go on and on with all the flaws and lack of depth compared to the previous movies which, are now even more of a shining beacon compared to this movie.
Parts simply dragged on and the acting was rather poor.
I'm glad others loved this movie.
I still have the previous movies to enjoy that much more now.
Yawn.
(except the 3rd one which was garbage) I dare say this remake was even 'Cheesy' geared to the 10 to 15 y.o.
Shrug.
teen target audience.
Sigh.
This was a "nice try" but seriously fell flat.
Abraham Lincoln Vampire Slayer was more inventive and unique than this movie.
Sorry, no true comparison IMO.

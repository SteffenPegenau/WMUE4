This is an excellent buy.
Frankly, that got my attention.
A friend in Atlanta referred the author to me a couple of years ago.
It is not an inexpensive book.
Does anyone know how to get in touch with him?
His description of the Fairy Ring allowed me to feel the energy spiral up.
I just completed reading the Word.
So I bought it.
Very spiritual.I saw the excellent reviews and the poor reviews on Amazon.
I am NOT a Pagan but I can relate to this book.
This is a fantastic read!!!
I read some excerpts but could find no controversial passages.
Ouch!
I just returned from Europe and wish I had had enough time to see Betws-y-coed Wales.
But after reading most of it, I have decided that I will never again look at the price tag before purchasing a book that looks interesting.
I would like to talk to Rhuddlwm about his experiences.
Oh - my - Goddess!!!
There is so much information in this one book, I may never buy another craft book again!

If is truly measuring resistance through your body this info should be irrelevant!
What it is actually doing is calculating your BMI.
Looks can be deceiving.
At first glance this scale looks fairly sophisticated.
People having trouble with the scale must be using their unit on carpet!
That is completely useless if you want to know your bodyfat percentage!
Utterly useless!!
Your body fat will go down if you say you are taller and will go up if you say you are shorter!
I'm fairly certain that the body fat sensor don't do anything at all.
!I rated this a two because the scale works very well.
Change your height!
In exact accordance with a BMI chart!
That or their's is defective.
Why does a body fat measuring device need to know if you are an athlete or what your height is?
Don't believe me?

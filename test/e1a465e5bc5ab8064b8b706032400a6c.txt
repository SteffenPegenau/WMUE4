Pleaz listen to this album.
R.I.P.
Any music really.
I am from the west side, but i still got the same amount of love for east coast.
This album came out, sold very well..... just like B.I.G.
It was the first song i heard from Life After Death.
so i stopped and listened to it, and i came out to be one of my favorite songs in the world.
Not just rappers.
This is not no Eminem or no Nelly ...... this album is Biggie Smalls.
Notorious Thugs was the best hit from this abum, but in my opinon i like Ten Crack Commandments the best.While fliping thrue songs, i heard the beat for it, and it brought my attention.
There is about mabey 5 artists the perfect talent.... the perfect voice... and Biggie is one of those artists.
A classic.
This whole album brought my attention.
But this one is the best.With Bone Thugs N Harmony, Notorious Thugs was a hit.
's other albums.
is an influence.
B.I.G.
He has brobably influenced over 20 rappers.
Notorious B.I.G.

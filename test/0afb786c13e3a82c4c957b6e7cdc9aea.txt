I wouldn't put it among my favorites, (Ashes of the Wake~ Lamb of God/ L.D.
Its still as ragful and angry as any other metal cd.
Metalcore is a mix of heavy metal (ie: Slipknot, Mudvayne, American Head Charge) and hardcore (ie: As I Lay Dying, Darkest Hour).
Their guitars thrash, grind, and explode.
DevilDriver is heavy metal.
This is a great album and a definite plus for DevilDriver.
Which it makes it better by nature, although i enjoyed their debut for its rawness.
Their drums pulse, pound, and destroy.
It is much more polished than their self-titled debut.
Well, they're not.
50~ Mudvayne/ The Feeding~ American Head Charge/ IOWA~ Slipknot) but it is still an amazing cd.
This my friends, is metal, not metalcore.Now, as fat as the cd goes, its amazing.
A lot of people are trying to call DevilDriver a metalcore band.
The vocals are snarly and growl.
However, the polished nature of this cd doesn't detract from its agressivness.

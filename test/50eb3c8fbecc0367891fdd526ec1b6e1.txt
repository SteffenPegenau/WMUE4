what a beautiful city.
I loved this film because of the story line .
.
San Antonio, TX .
This film is a perfect example of Mexican American Postmodern Films.
I loved the heavy metal rocker and the brainy Chicana student.
.
it has everything double-codings and contradictions, hybridity, ironic relationship towards history, oppositional stance, and incoherent narrative!
.
Overall I really liked it and I would recommend it to all.

Also, the location of this film was great .

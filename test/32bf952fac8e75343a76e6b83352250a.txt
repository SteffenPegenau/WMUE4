Most bands would kill for this selection to make their best record.
It's interesting that, with the exception of Hairdresser on Fire, these were all b-sides.
But nothing takes away though from this collection.
The man is talented, no doubt.
Maybe he will.
(If you want a dose of crummy studio outtakes, just pick up My Early Burglary Years.)
But at least this is a great one.
It's funny how Morrissey is the king of the re-package.
But let's face it.
Unfortunately, Morrissey has hit the skids from a creative point of view the past few years.
Clean production, witty, insightful lyrics, savvy musicianship.
He never promised he was going to get better.
It just seems when he concentrates on full even albums, his work shines the brightest.
This record demonstrates just how far he is going to have to come back to show the talent he obviously has.
This record serves as an example of everything Morissey was and what he should be today.

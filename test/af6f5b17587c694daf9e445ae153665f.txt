I usually like her books but this one really did leave something to be desired.

Hhhhmmmm .
Why did he dump her?
Shame on him for expecting a 17-18 year old to want to commit just like that.
well I just don't know that I would.
Because she didn't take the ultimatum?
For him to hold a grudge, claim that he didn't, and then ask her to give up everything for him .
Kinda don't like my male leads acting like what the traditional heroine would act like.

Would have helped if we had a little bit more information from Flynn but we didn't.
Sorry.
seems a bit of a role reversal here.

I really love the characters and relationships... and movie sequences.
Great game.
One of the best villains!
And I changed my mind.
He was so great.
I must admit, I am a big 8 fan, so the switch to 9 was tough.
Actually, the ending fight led up to this... thing.
Anyway, please play the game... if you want.
OMG, the best music!!
Nobumoto made a breakthrough with "The Place I'll Return to Someday" and "Loss of Me."
Yeah, I guess the climax was kinda weak and the ending video was disappointing at first, but I watched it again.
I immediately criticized it for it's cartoony characters... plus, the setting was just so different.
But gradually the game won me over.
Why couldn't there be more of him?
(Ah bonding) And another craft of wonder is Freya.
(Though I'm an 8 fanatic)
KUJA!
Vivi and Zidane have this beautuful relationship.
It was pretty good, just not as tight as I would have liked.
Sometimes frustrating but Vivi overrode that.

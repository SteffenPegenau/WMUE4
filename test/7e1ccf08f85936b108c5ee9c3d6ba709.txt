As of this writing, there are 5 different tribute CDs devoted to the Sisters of Mercy.
Lucretia My Reflection - Dan Swanö10.
Floorshow - Headtrip Inc.5.
Temple of Love - DesireIf you are looking for something good to listen to while holding your breath until the new Sisters album is released, you have found it.
This release from Sweden, as you may have guessed, consists largely of deep-voiced bands with metal overtones to their music.
Considering the competition, though, I thought all the music here was very enjoyable.
Perhaps this is to be expected, given that the Sisters themselves have not released a proper album in over a decade.
Body and Soul - Funhouse6.
On a Wire - Sons Of Neverland9.
Something Fast - Snow Storm12.
The track listing:1.
Alice - Mobile Mob Freakshow4.

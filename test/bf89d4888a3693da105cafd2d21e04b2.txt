A picture of it in the box would have shown its true size.
I saw this online and thought it was perfect!
However, the seller should specify the size of this pocket-sized toy.
It is so tiny and not worth the money I payed.
(My nephew wants hers, but we have misplaced it.)
But not $40...*** This was a misunderstanding on my part.
I am extremely disappointed because I just spent close to $40 dollars on a toy that is about 5 inches...
(at least to me).
The picture makes it look a lot larger than it really is.
It looked almost exactly like the one she had.
She had a toy that was the size of a doll.
I should have double checked on the size before my purchase, but the picture was misleading.
The Ninja Turtles are a classic, so a high price is okay.
Nowhere on here does it say the size of the toy.
When my sister was young she loved the ninja turtles (Michelangelo was her favorite).

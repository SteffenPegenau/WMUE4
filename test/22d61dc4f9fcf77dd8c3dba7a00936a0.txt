If they're not going to put out a Blu-ray version, could they at least put out a widescreen version?
Manning takes the final snap, and the DVD goes to the credits.
I just watched the whole thing and you get to hear his comments on every single play.
If you still are, then these DVD's are a 5.
It's 2008.
How many people are still watching 4:3 TV?
Bottom line, if you're a Giants' fan, you have to buy this.
This leads to one final disappointment.
My favorite part of the collection is the Super Bowl DVD with Michael Strahan's commentary track.
Are you kidding me?
I'm excited to own 5 great games of the greatest Giants' season ever, but the disks disappoint somewhat.
I mean zero.
I could have easily given this 3 stars or 5 stars.
Just be prepared it will probably leave you wanting more from it.
There is nothing of the post game on here.

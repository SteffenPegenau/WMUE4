I was getting nearly half of the LR, half of the AR and half of the RC sections wrong.
You'll do fine, but toss this book.
I didn't know what I was doing wrong...Then I read the reviews.This book, in no way, indicates how well you will do on the test.
Review?
EVERY ONE!It's tough studying for the LSAT.
I bought this book because it was the only one on the shelf and I thought,what could be the difference between this and Kaplan and Prin.
Wow was I wrong.
I burnt this book (literally) and did some practice LSATS.
NOW!
This book makes you think you're not a smart person and you'll never get into a law school.
I scored 6 more correct on nearly every section.
This is awful.
It's not true.
Buy anything from Powerscore instead.
If you own a copy of this, burn it, like I did.
EVERY TIME!
It can drain your confidence.

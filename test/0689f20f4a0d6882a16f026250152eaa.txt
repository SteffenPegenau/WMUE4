THAT IS LIKE SAYING X-MAS IS ALL ABOUT PRESENTS?
Women and Men are 100% equal.
X-MAS IS NOT ABOUT PRESENTS, IT MEANS MUCH, MUCH MORE.
Also the amount of songs on it is truly annoying combined with the extremely bad soundtrack.
The soundtrack is bad, it sounds like a music box with almost(dead) batteries.
HOW CAN WE CANCEL X-MAS?
They treat rudloph badly because of his nose.
"We need to get the women back to christimas-town."
SPEND IT ON ANOTHER X-MAS SPECIAL LIKE "A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS" OR THE GRINCH.
Should we treat people badly because they are different?
NO THEY ARE NOT.
Also it is very bad in another way, too.
I DO NOT THINK SO.
DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!
They say X-Mas is gonna be cancled.
The message is bad.
So women are helpless.

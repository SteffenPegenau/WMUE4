They then passed me on to an engineer in their engineering dept.
I am a not so proud owner of 3 bad 810+'s.
Nobody could explain why this kept crashing.
Again, while entering my wep key it crashed and wouldn't take firmware.
The first one configured fine.
Begrudgingly I recieved a third one.
I am a proud owner of several good products from dlink.
I spoke to level 1 and 2 tech support from dlink.
Other bad hardware on my side was elininated because the third one was configured on a different pc, different cat 5 different nic, etc.
That one crashed when trying to apply my wep key.
OK every once in a while you get a bad one, so I returned it for a second one.
DO NOT BUY THIS!
I decided to upgrade the firmware on it, and it crahed, not taking any firmware.
User error was eliminated, I work in IT and this is an easy piece to configure, far from my first.
It is a bad piece of equipment and I will be getting a linksys very soon.
It wouldn't take any firmware after a reset.

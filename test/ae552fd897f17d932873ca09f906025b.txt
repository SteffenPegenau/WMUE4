per fight.
From now on, Sweet Sweat will always be in my gym bag!
So I finally decided to try it for my next fight.
I could not believe how much I was sweating with Sweet Sweat.
I was able to cut 8 lbs.
I had no idea that you can lose so much water weight in a single workout and/or sauna session.
WOW!!!
This is the best sweat enhancer on the market!
It used to take me 2-3 hours to cut this much water weight and I would usually have no energy for my fights the next day because I was so depleted from sitting in the sauna for so long.
I also had more energy the next day for my fight which gave me the edge I needed to fight through a decision.
I am a MMA fighter and I typically cut around 6-8 lbs.
of water weight for my next fight in just one hour of exercising and sauna.

I have seen several guys around the gym using Sweet Sweat so and raving about it.
I could honestly fill up a glass with all of the sweat in my shirt and shorts.

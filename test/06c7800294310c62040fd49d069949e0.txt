Went to wrong address and was returned.
Not so.
Cut my day at work, went home and prepared to watch.
Anyway.
Where're the other 3?
I will NEVER purchase another thing from GoHastings (they refused to replace the DVD - 'time had run out', they said).That being said, the DVD was disappointing, to say the least.
I must have gotten my wires crossed, because I thought the 'Secret' movie was a... MOVIE.
If you have the book, don't waste money on the DVD, and vice versa.
The 'extended edition' is nonsense.
Luckily the other 2 had DVDs in them, so at least 2 of my friends got their copies.
Opened the package.
As soon as I got the SEALED package, I extracted one copy.
I got NONE.
It's just the book recorded; plus, I had to be navigating between chapters.
Yea!
I was a bit disappointed - NO.
Bought 6 to hand out to friends, got 3 in one package from GoHastings.
I loved the book so much I couldn't wait to get my hands on this.
VERY disappointed.
NO bloody DVD!

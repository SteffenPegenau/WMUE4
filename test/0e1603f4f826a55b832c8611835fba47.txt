Do not read this!
Someone told me if I liked the movie Cast away with Tom Hanks I would love this.
I mean there are way to many books about kids getting stuck on islands.
He wants to see the wild dogs on the island because he never seen them before.
I mean dont you think that they would know how to survive on an island that they have lived on there entire life!
Boy were they wrong this book [was really bad]!
The ships begin to sail away but her brother forgot something.
IF I COULD I WOULDN'T GIVE IT A STAR!
Her brother is the reason that she stays on the island.
He goes back to get it but he can't catch up.
He had lived on the island all his life and he knew that they were not nice.
But he trys to kill one because they begin to starve!
WOW THIS BOOK WAS SOO BAD!
He ends up dying because a dog eats him!
The captin wont slow down.So the girl jumps out into the water to stay with him.
Man it [is bad].

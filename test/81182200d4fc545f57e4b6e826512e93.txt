At least Mark realized his music career was a joke.
I'm not putting down the Transformers, but pop culture had not a hint of sense throughout most of the 80s.
17 years ago everyone and their mother sported hardcore mullets, wore sweat pants, and...were obsessed with the Transformers.
I'd recommend listening to a few samples off this CD before doing anything crazy like buying it.
The song's also funny because Mark Wahlberg performed it in Boogie Nights as a mockery.
In particular, listen to The Touch by Stan Bush.
But if they don't make you nauseous, I can guarantee you'll be laughing.
Do you want to wake up one day and realize your music collection is a joke too?
I bet he's pretty ashamed of himself today if he's still alive.
This soundtrack shouldn't even be for sale anymore.
Oh no, the samples were enough to make me sick.
What was this guy thinking?
Do yourself a favor and avoid this CD.
Is every reviewer on here still living in 1986 or what?
Do you think I bought it?

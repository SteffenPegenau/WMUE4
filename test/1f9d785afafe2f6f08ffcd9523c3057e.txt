I have been slowly trying to plow through my collection of 3,000 movies, and most of the time when they are this bad I've been turning them off.
I've seen hundreds of them.
I just kept expecting more from this.
Not this time.
This is one of the worst pieces of garbage I've ever had the misfortune to suffer through.
Many are good, many are passable.

As previous reviewers have mentioned, the ending made no sense.
Unfortunately, most of the movie made no sense as well.
I love cheesy horror movies.
The Lionsgate name usually means that at least some quality.
Stay away at all costs!
Most at least have one redeeming feature.
Not this one.
Characters would appear and disappear for no reason; people told pointless ghost stories to pad the run time of the movie; somebody puked up weird insect things...

We enjoy reading all of the on line support.
This Plan, Let's Do Lunch has been the best blessing we could have received.
We are in our late 60's early 70's.
Well maybe not quite, but close!
We have been sharing this idea with friends and have passed out a few extra books.
My husband Jim and I started eating healthy May 6.
Let' Do Lunch!!
We just got "married" last October and decided we wanted to take better care of ourselves so we could enjoy each other for as long as possible.
!
God Bless Roger Troy Wilson for his idea.
My husband is an excellent cook and has been adapting his favorite recipes to fit this new eating lifestyle.
Having a help mate to eat with makes a lot of difference.
We have each lost 20 lbs.
We are also having fun finding new recipes.
Our energy level has increased and we are acting like teenagers again.

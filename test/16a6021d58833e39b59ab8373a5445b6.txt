Gina Lollabridga is not old as Bogart's sultry wife.
Jennifer Jones is cute but annoying as Bogat's mistress.
Ms Jones has a lot of pointless & boring dialogue.
The print I had from Maducy was as usual, terrible.
He has thrown in with a gang of losers in an ill-defined scheme to buy some land in Africa that contains uranium.
They hava a long boat ride ahead of them.
Shot in Italy it appears on the cheap.
Without Bogie & Lorre this movie is nothing.
So it's ok.
He's past his leading man prime.
John Huston & Truman Capote directed & rewrote it on the fly.
(correct me if I'm wrong).
Bogie looks old as do his pals Peter Lorre & Robert Morley.
Things go awry.
Production wise it barely holds together.

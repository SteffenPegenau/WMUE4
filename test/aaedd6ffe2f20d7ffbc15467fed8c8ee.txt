Nothing happens on the cruise.The second part is about Paul's son Fenno.
He wants her to have a home after he is gone.
A gay photographer who's house sitting in Manhattan.
His neighbor, Mal, asks him to take his bird Felicity for him.
I tried, but I just couldn't make it.Please, don't read this book.
That's it.
They have wild sex every day for a while and then Tony disappears.And I didn't finish the 3rd part.
No action.
Fenno is gay and owns a book store in Manhattan.
No murders.
This was probably the best of the 3 stories.
It's extremely boring and pointless.
I read about 2/3s of this book and gave up.
You see Mal is dying of AIDS.Fenno also meets Tony.
Nothing happens in this entire book.
It's a total waste of your time.
No nothin'!It's called Three Junes not because it's about three people named June, but because the book is split up into 3 parts that all take place in June of different years.The first part is about Paul McLeod.
The entire story is about him on a cruise.

The warranty dealer said he has been getting a lot of these in his shop.
Many people are having lots of problems with it.
Wish I had done a little research before I wasted over $200 on this piece of junk!!!!
DO NOT BUY THIS WEED EATER!!!!
It would not start again.
Something on the inside melted together on ours.
It has been in the shop almost 2 months waiting for him to hear back from Troy-Bilt.
Now it's been almost two months without a weed eater.
We called the warranty number and was told to take it to a local warranty dealer.
Get out there and weed eat with a pair of scissors?!?!?!
It lasted 3 months.
Save your money!!!!
Hello... We bought it because we needed it.
!
We bought this weed eater from Lowe's in March.
We have a very small yard so it wasn't used very long at each use.
While my husband was weed eating the yard he heard a noise and smelled something burning.
What do they expect me to do?

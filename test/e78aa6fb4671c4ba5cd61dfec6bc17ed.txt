Please.
How could it be a loser.
I love a good scare.
I read the reviews and thought it must be fabulous.
Terribly disappointing ending.
Had it figured out pretty soon after the final scene at the farm.
I should have done housework and gone to bed early.
Totally disappointing.
Ending was unbelievable.
Stephen King read it, gave it a good review.
I spent the entire day reading it on Saturday, finished 3 am.
Gee...
If this book is considered scarey, then Godzilla movies must be terrifying....
OH, as for needing a nightlight to be able to overcome the terror.
Somehow didn't understand why Barney gave Margot the rape kit and don't care enough now that I've completed the book to go back and re-read that chapter.

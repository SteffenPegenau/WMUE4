There were two other vehicles with hard-tops in this movie.Cathy's monologue after being rescued from the schoolteachers house was just heavy handed and artificial.Why Hitch?
Tippi Hedren's character looks into the upstairs room, sees all the birds, and THEN slips INTO the room.
WHAT?
Even someone with a slight eye for quality could tell there is something very off about this film.Suspension of disbelief = There was none.
Let's get the children out of here!
And Cathy with the stupid Lovebirds, can we bring them Mitch?
Can we take them in a tiny, FABRIC TOP convertible to make our escape.
Let's take them OUTSIDE!
I watched this again, having seen it the first time many years ago, and since then, seen many superior Hitch films.
Was it the studio?
I know 5 star reviews for Hitch are automatic for some, but did you pay attention at all?
Ex.
Did they have your children at gunpoint?
Highly implausable choices by characters.
We're inside, let's run OUTSIDE and get somewhere safer!

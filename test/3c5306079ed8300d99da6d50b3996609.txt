I'm In The Mood For Love: The Chimes8.
Here's the tracks:1.
My feeling is that the publisher threw together some "suave-ish" tunes and throw the "Shagadelic Hits" title on it to capitalize on the Austin Powers craze of the time.
Hernando's Hideaway: Archie Bleyer5.
I Love How You Love Me: The Paris Sisters13.
Let It Be Me: Jerry Butler & Betty Everett6.
Help Me Make It Through The Night: Sammi Smith14.
Hello Stranger: Barbara Lewis11.
Afternoon Delight: Starland Vocal Band3.
Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me: Mel Carter7.
Chanson D'Amour: Art & Dotty Todd10.
You Took Advantage of Me: Tony Bennett4.
(If Loving You is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right: Luther Ingram9.
Moonlight Feels Right: Starbuck2.
Tell It Like It Is: Aaron Neville12.
I Ain't No One Night Only Love Maker: Tom Jones
This is an OK collection - especially for the low price.

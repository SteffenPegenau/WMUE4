It was good and challenging.
I have a decent collection of DVD's, that are all over the board.. From Jillian to Turbo Jam to Tae Bo.
The instuctor was good and seemed like he knew what he was doing but the routine sucked.
I don't think Biggest Loser is doing the franchise any favors by putting crap like this out.
Her "workout" was so easy.
The last workout was terrible.
However, it was only 15 minutes.
Luckily, I got it on Netflix instead of actually buying it.
However, I don't really fault her for that because she has no experience and probably didn't know what she was getting into.
She has no charism and is fake.
Bob's segment, was classic Bob.
It was so repetative and boring.
Overall, I felt like I didn't get much of a workout.
I agree with most reviewers in that Anna is hands down the worst.
I can honestly say this is the worst workout I've ever done.

After the first two movies came out, I was totally excited for number 3.
Its like leaving out the polly jucie potion in the Chamber of Secrets, ummm no, i dont think so.
Hello!!
Not so good.
Fred and George are hardly even in the movie!
Doesnt even compair to Chris Columbus's work.
Come on Warner Brothers step its up.
Get this, the first to movies were longer and the 3rd book has about 200 more pages.
They dont even have school uniforms.
Big disappointment for the harry potter fiends like myself.
Its not even that funny.
Things were cut out and not explained.
That isnt even close to like the book.
Dont even think about ruining book 4 or Ill come after you in the night.
Griffindor is suppost to win the cup!!!
No oliver wood?
That was like a huge thing in the 3rd book.

I was not too disappointed - in fact I felt a bit smug because I had just purchased a half dozen black ink cartridges at a good price over the internet!
The new driver allowed me to see my ink status.
I will NEVER buy from Epson again.
Total loss.
The black cartridge was full, but the color was empty!
I'm WAY too cheap to ever use color!
No luck.
But the ink light was still on!
I took out the cartridge, shook it, reinserted it over and over.
Recently my "low ink" light went on in the middle of a project.
How could this be?
So I changed cartridges and went on to continue my project.
I went to the Epson website to get a new driver.
I inserted my new black cartridges into the colored slots.
Trash can time.
In fact all 3 of the colored cartridges had suddenly become empty!

)Last man standing featuring Cena vs. umaga was ok.
I would find a way to see only the rumble match itself and skip the undercard stuff.
OUT
The 2007 royal rumble was overall disappointment for several reasons.
The final two stars remaining were taker and hbk.
It had its good moments and slow points.
The only good match of the night was the royal rumble itself.
Thanks for reading.
HBK attempted to eliminate taker with a superkick but taker countered by lifting micheals up on his shoulders and throwing him over the top rope and out of the ring.
I did like that wwe decided to go back to leaving the rumble match for last( as it should be every year).
I cant strongly recommend buying this one.
I dont understand why wwe insists on pushing kennedy so much.
(trying to create the next big star perhaps?
Batista vs. kennedy was not that exciting for me.
Those reasons have to do with the matches which were on the card.

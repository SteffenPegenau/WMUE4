You can't go wrong with this toy.
Even though the toy is recommended for 2-5 years of age we decided to purchase this toy for our one year old's birthday.
It took about 10 mins and only required 4 screws to secure it.
He absolutely lowes it!!
The assembly on the toy was so easy!
The minute my husband got it up he was climbing all over it and got right up the step ladder with no problems!
I have been taking him to the park and he has shown a growing interest in the slides.
Highly recommended!
which was one of my concerns when buying a slide for our son.
My husband loved the fact it was so easy to put together and my son loves the slide and climbing into it and under it.
!
The toy is very sturdy (I was able to climb onto the platform and I am currently 140 lbs.)
He goes down the slide and climbs right back up.
Your child will get years of enjoyment.
We figured he would grow into it but WOW!

The screen of the TV reads 'no signal.'
Do I need a different cable?
It's this one.Panasonic TC-L32X2 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV with iPod DockUPDATE:The problem was the product.
Appears to be a well-made product.
Does this matter?
Guess I got a bad cable.
It didn't work.
It's a new television, with plenty of ports and Viera capability.
I notice some with a Y splitter, two male, and one female connection.Also, I don't have HDMI.
There is also a female port on my PC which I haven't utilized.
Ended up buying a much more expensive one from Best Buy.
But I need a little help.
:(
I didn't care for the high monthly bill for what I considered little programing that I actually liked.
I connected the double male ends, one each to my PC and LCD TV.

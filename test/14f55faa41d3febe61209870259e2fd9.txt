Even William Friedkin and Blatty edited "Exorcist" for the screen.
But this film does NOT!
I suppose the writing is wonderful.
"Oz" cannot be compared to "Hogbore".
I've never been drawn in.
To compare this film to "Wizard Of Oz" is absurd.
I'm not a fan of these films.
It's horrible.
I WANT to be entertained by these films.
This film droned on for near to three hours.
I truly do.
It seems these films render one in a trance, an unescapable one.
The young adult love is nauseating at best.
It's just too infantile.
The novels are as popular as air, I can't seem to get through those either.
I just don't "get" them.
Lord, I can't seem to find an escape from this boredom.
A novel this long?
The ONLY good point to this film is it's set design.

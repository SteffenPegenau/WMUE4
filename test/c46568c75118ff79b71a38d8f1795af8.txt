Why do people hate on Canibus?
Let's hope this is not his last one.
Canbius is one of the best MC's to touch the mic.
The album is 11 tracks long (short and sweet).
Why do people say LL ate him in the battle?
Tracks that are good are "Poet Lauerete II", "M Sea Cresy", "Cinematics", "Psych Evaluation", "No Return", & "Genabius".
The album takes a while to get into just like his other LPs.
Canibus just spits hard all over him.
The man is intelligent.
Canibus offers his fifth LP, Rip the Jacker.
The production is done by Stoupe of Jedi Mind Tricks.
But it's Bis's lyrics that keep the album from being a huge let down.
The other tracks to me are average or just plain boring.
I don't know why.
The beats have a Latin/Egyptian feel to it.

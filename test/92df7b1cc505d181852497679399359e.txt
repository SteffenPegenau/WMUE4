cant go wrong!
Like tuning the radio one direction, either the indicator will stick at the top or the bottom.
I have an old red one exactly like this.
When it finally does die, I plug it in during the day and thats it!
I still plug it in rather than wind it, but seriously, I listen to this thing every night, and fall asleep listening to it.
So its on at least 7 hours a night, and leave it close to a window during the day, and a single charge will last no less than a month!
I'd buy another one again though!
They are just sloppy feeling.
BUY IT!
I bought this to keep at home and have the red one for work.
It tunes into AM and FM stations just fine.
The solar panel really makes the battery life last!
The volume control knob feels different too.
The red one is better, the blue one has a funny feel to the dial.
If you are looking for a small portable battery op radio, this is perfect!

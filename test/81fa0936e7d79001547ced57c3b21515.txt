I don't notice the smell that some have mentioned.
It applies and absorbs well.
I could always give my own objective negative review if it hasn't met the hype.
Haven't noticed any improvement in terms of erasing/minimizing creases in my forehead or other areas.
I'm posting a 3* review to keep things real.
I don't find it greasy.
So far, no problems.
I generally apply at night.
Just started using about a week ago though, around 4/15/12.
Will upgrade if I notice that it starts to match the hype of other reviews.
I will update this review in time.
No complaints at all.
I've noticed softer/smoother skin.
I'm generally pretty skeptical about some products when the reviews are generally too glowing, but I figured that I'd try this.
Hello,So, I decided to purchase this product after reading the reviews.

The plot was really off and draggy.
That annoyed me terribly.
And what was with a 'Dancing lion"?
Dreamworks are normally good with films.
Like Spirit Stallion of the Cimeron and Shrek.
The animals stand on TWO legs instead of four.
I watched it and was HIGHLY disapointed.
I would rather reconmand "The Wild" by Disney.
And how cana Hippo and a Gyraffe mate?
The humor was rather off and a bit innapropiate for children.
I am giving it two stars instead of one only because some of the music was cool.
A movie with a bunch of funny and cute zoo animals, sounds good right?
Use some sense here Dreamworks.
And the voices for the animals were pretty bad too and didn't match their characters.
But this was a big flop.
Where's the sense in that?

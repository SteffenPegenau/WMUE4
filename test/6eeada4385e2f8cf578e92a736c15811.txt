Lets talk hit detection.
Phew, my "squad" is finally here.
Also, let's say you die, you are started in a spot where it may take minutes (1-2) or (5-7) for your "squad" to show up and help you.
So basically, for some unknown amount of time, you must fight the entire German army by yourself.
The multiplayer is garbage.
Sure, you can take some hits, but the enemies can take half a clip of .30 caliber ammunition and still charge at you too!
Your "squad" AI makes them act like a bunch of drunken raccoons, rather than a crack airborne unit.
I hope they can help me out now.
The difficulty is really off on this one.
Aaaaawe they are all dead from a single grenade.
Pretty much, no matter where you shoot a Nazi...he will simply shrug it off and run away.
Sounds cool right?
If your allies, you parachute into the action.
Not when enemies snipers just keep picking you off before you hit the ground.
Not exactly a fair fight.

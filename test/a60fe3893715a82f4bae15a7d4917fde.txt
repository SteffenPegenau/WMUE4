It took great pics!
It was turned on...therefore my lens was out.
I bought this camera b/c I had lost my previous digital elph (which I loved and had for over 2 yrs).
I loved everything about it until......I dropped it.
When I turned off the camera the lens would not retract.
I got an error message "lens error, restart your camera".
Well, I tried to turn it off and then on again.
I like the size and ease of use for this camera.
I called Dell and since have shipped it off to get an estimate on repairs.
If they can determine that it was dropped then I would have to pay for repairs out of pocket.
It stayed in the same position.
I was sitting and trying to grab my camera in a hurry and I dropped it.
I am a mom of two and I use my camera all the time.
I have since decided that I would buy another one if the repairs are too costly.Bottom line...great camera....just don't drop it!
Bad news...I will be without my camera for 2-3 weeks.

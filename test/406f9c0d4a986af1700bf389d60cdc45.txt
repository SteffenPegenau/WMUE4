The villian decides to rape nobility and this is his great flaw.
Humans are given to mauling each other in a way beasts never do.
Life is good.
She falls in love with the hero.
Unless the readers who love this book are human - in which case it is understandable.
Very romantic stuff.
How this book can be distinguished from a deary wallow in the worst human behavior and the ussual facile validation of it, I can not say.
If he stuck to screaming peasants it would have been OK.
The hero goes with his band of archers, on a killing and raping spree across France.
This he enjoys.
The heroine is saved from him by her nobility apparently.
They leave farms and defenseless villages destroyed.
All historically accurate, but why anyone should accept this as a viable romance or adventure I don't know.
Perhaps she likes it rough.
The nobility do alright though.

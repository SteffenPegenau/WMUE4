Pretty dull in my opinion.
Perhaps a collection drawing from all of their albums would be more pleasing?
I do agree with another reviewer who wrote that this is much better than listening to headache-inducing techno music.
Mmm mmm.
On the technical side, I LOVE the mix-especially the bass and drums.
It is a healthy mix of r&b soul funk dance house and disco.
It would be fine if the songs were actually compelling, but most of them are not.
TRAVELLING WITHOUT MOVING was massively hyped and won some major awards I believe.
It's just too much.
The opener is great and I also like the slow funk instrumental.
Listen to that kick drum!
Most of the rest sounds like too conscious an attempt to be retro and sound 70's.
Bright moments shine thru, but not enough for me to recommend this album.
They sound great.
These guys are really trying to be 'hip' and it's not working for me.
I like half of this album at most.

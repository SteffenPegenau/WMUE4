I also loved the music.
I also enjoyed the visuals and the score that the movie offered.
I especially enjoyed Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman.
There were so many sides to this character and they were all played so wonderfully.
Tim Burton is a brilliant and creative artist.
I loved the depth and complexity of the characters.
I feel that this movie was very under appreciated.
I commend everyone who put their time and effort into making this movie.
The character performances were beautifully illustrated by the actors.
Catwoman was played with so much finesse.
I love this movie.
It's as though they're real people.
The performances of Batman, Max Shreck, and the Penguin are also played with great strength.
Danny Elfman is one of the most brilliant composers I've ever had the opportunity to listen to.
This movie is so extraordinary.

Muffins bake in 5-10 minutes.
Mix up a batch, make the muffins you want, and store any left over batter in the fridge for the next time.
Also great for snacks.
I love this thing!
Did I mention I love this thing?
Easy clean up with wet cloth while still warm.
Fast and easy to use.
Indicator light changes to green when ready to use.
To get the bake time you want, stand by at 5 minutes and peek every minute until muffins are golden brown.
It will be ready by the time you have the batter ready to go.
After that just set your timer.
This is great for 1 or 2 people who don't have a lot of time for breakfast.
If you forget to clean up while its still warm, it's still a breeze.
Now I can have a warm muffin whenever I want.
I wipe out the cups with a paper towel then a wet cloth.

I carefully packed it in another box and returned it.
My unit stopped heating after a month's use.
Please do yourself a favor and buy another brand.
That component burnt out at least two more times and changing that part became routine.
It cost me over a $100 to get it fixed and returned.
Called the manufacturer who told me to send it back but that I must use the original box.
Offered to sell me a box.
Three months later it stopped heating again.
The repair shop said the they received it broken and sent a picture of a press in a box with a broken handle.
This time they told me to open it and replace a thermistor which they sold to me.
Said they would gladly send it back as is, but I would have to pay shipping.
I don't believe that I got 20 hours of use out of it.
They either replaced the handle with a used one, or did not replace it at all.
Now the press would not even turn on.
Unfortunately, I had thrown it away.

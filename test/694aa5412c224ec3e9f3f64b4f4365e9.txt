Rather more like: ........ zzzz.
What characterises this decade?
I kept hearing how these guys are the next big thing.
Go back to sleep junior, music is just entertainment: I keep forgetting that it shouldn't be something more.
I'll tell you what: it's the decade where bands imitated music of the past except without the wit or imagination that made the music interesting in the first place.
Heard it all before, nothing even remotely original or interesting about this band.
What will people say about the 2000s?
If that's true then rock is surely dead.
it's derivitive and dull.
I don't necessarily turn it off when I hear it on the radio, but for the most part it's just more top 40 overhyped mush, i.e.
Yuck.
Well maybe that's too strong a reaction.
Trendy, trendy.
There are better bands out there folks, trust me.Oh yeah, the '80s were TWENTY f-ing years ago, get a clue.
Mindcandy for TV people.

I love the look of the red and black square design.
The large dinner plate is LARGE!
they are a much better size and you know you wont over load your plate with food.
Other then that I really do like the plates.
There are three problems I have with these dishes.
Doesn't fit in certain cupboards and has to go in lower one making it hard to get to.
LOVE the mugs.
Very heavy, must have muscles to carry all the plates.

They have to be the best part of the set!
We normally just use the smaller dinner plates.

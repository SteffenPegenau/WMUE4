This is a superhero movie not some romance movie.
But sadly, he barely had any screen time in the movie.
Sandman, Goblin, AND Venom?!
Nothing special.
Another thing.
That's about it with the bad stuff.
I think Venom is amazing (in the comics).
There is too much drama.
3/4 of this movie is boring romance stuff between Mary Jane and Peter.
Come on!!
Sandman was OKAY...
Overall about 3/5 to me.
The Goblin was pretty cool, and that's probably the best part of the movie.
The good things are the acting was good and the special effects were great.
Okay, let me start off saying there a waaaaaay too many villains in the film (by the way I'm reviewing the film not the DVD).
You gotta be kidding me!

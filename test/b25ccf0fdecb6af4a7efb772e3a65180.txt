This relaunch of the Fantastic Four by Jim Lee is visually stunning.
They will stand united and fight for justice until all the members die in unison.
I'd recommend The Essential Fantastic Four for the best FF stories.
The Fantastic Four will NEVER die.
If you like to collect trade paperbacks, get it.
I'd recommend many individual issues of the FF, but this series is so unnecessary that I was completely regretful of my purchase.
This will disappoint even the most sympathetic comic reader.
I think not.
However, is it necessary?
If you like Jim Lee's art, buy it.
I give two stars for the art, ZERO stars for the story or originality.
Perhaps the best of the Heros Reborn group.
I'd recommend waiting for the Carlos Pancheo and Jeph Loeb series which would surely be bound together in Trade paperback form in the near future.
If you like FF as a group, don't.
If you like to collect great stories in one volume, don't get this.

You will cry laughing.
Rasheed is not for everyone.
Too funny for words.
Pure rip off.
I bought this DVD because I wanted to purchase a specific video of a particular comedian: Rasheed Thurmond, who is HILARIOUS!
Problem?
The show I saw had Rasheed and way other funny comedians who don't appear on this DVD at all.
Either that or what we purchased was the "short version" of season 1.
If you don't believe me, google his name and watch his comedy clips.
He's NOT on the DVD.
I'm upset about it too.
He was THE BEST ever on that show.
The seller must have wanted to be safe and kept the mediocre ones for this DVD in my opinion.
If you type his name on this website's search field - the "bad boys" video comes up.
Or take a look here...[....] (scroll down).
I distinctly remember that this show is where I first saw Rasheed.

Releasing "Left Behind" further show a bad attempt at getting more $.
Slipknot just turns it upside down and makes it look new.
This isn't cutting edge music folks!!
This was cool in the mid 80's.
It doesn't take 9 people to do what they do, they just aren't competent to do so.
But then again it's RR, who need to be put out of buisness for their recent decisions.
"If your 555 than I'm 666" what is that?
Not even close.
And the lyrics sound like nursery rymes.
You can't make death metal mainstream, not saying that this is death metal.
I hope that this is the album that launches Slipknot back to iowa where they came from, because I'm tired of hearing about them.
This band is a gimmick.
One thing I can't stand about them is how they never give Slayer any credit for ripping them off.
I loved thier first album, but they are flat out lying when said it would destroy that effort.
If you want real death metal get something from Dilinger Escape Plan or Nothingface.

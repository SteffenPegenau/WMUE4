Hats off to a group who can make entertaining music without the use of four letter words.
It's called talent.
I can't stop listening to it.

Although I found myself comparing it to Ratt because of the voice of Stephen Pearcy, I had to point out some differences.
I wanted to take some time and listen to it a few times before writing a review.
I'd highly reccomend this for any collection, especially for Ratt fans!
I wanted to be sure to get it right.
In my opinion every song on this cd is well worth the listening.
Any Ratt fan would love to have this one.
"Nothin' to Lose" sounds like a typical Ratt song to me and I love it!
I purchased this cd expecting to be mildly diappointed by it.
"Mother Blues" is a acoustic and a little bluesy which is obvious from the title.
I was very wrong.
However another favorite of mine is "Cry no more", a ballad!!

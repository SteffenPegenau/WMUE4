Only once did I chuckle at something humorous.
That didn't make sense to me since the name she signed wasn't a name used by anyone else.
Copyright: 2002.
I didn't enjoy the plot or the characters that much.
I do not recommend "Faking It."
Genre: contemporary romance.
Setting: current day U.S.
Sexual language: moderate.
Davy had a smaller role in that book and now this book is about him.
The painter in this story felt she might go to jail if anyone found out.
Nothing surprised or delighted me.
I read this because I loved three other books by this author which are "Bet Me,' "Welcome To Temptation" and "Anyone But You."
Number of sex scenes: three.
Someone paints pictures and signs them with a fake name in the way someone uses a "pen name" to write books.
This book is the sequel to Welcome To Temptation, which was about Sophie and Phin.
Davy is a reformed con man who meets the painter and more events happen.
The plot didn't make sense to me.

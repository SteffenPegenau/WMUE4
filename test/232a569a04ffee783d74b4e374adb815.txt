A disappointment.
This one I fast forwarded thru the first 11 tracks, too loud, too slow.
His accent made him very hard to understand.
Orange Blossom Special and the Polkas were up to past standards.
)colors everything in a dark shade of red.
I have all the earlier James Last videos and they were fun to watch over and over.
Jumbo TV screen behind performers is very distracting.
The red spotlight(?
This was not a problem with the interviews on the earlier James Last tapes.
The audio is not the usual.
Audience participation: Three rows of "cheer leaders" in front of stage.
Only 55 minutes of music.
Interview with James took up the rest of the 77-minute "running time."
If I had paid $100 for front row seats and all I saw was the back sides of these folks trying to be kids again ...
I don't know if the $10 I paid for "Live At The Royal Albert Hall" was worth it.
The first half sounds like heavy metal rock-n-roll.

Can barely make out Findley's rhythm guitar under Schenker's axe.
Barden's voice is shot - he has no range at all.
But this band seems to be the mediocre MSG.
Simon Wright does ok on the drums, but I'll take Shane Galas.
And lacking.
Neil Murray is a journeyman bass player at best.
I am a long time MSG fan.
He's not a fraction as good as Barry Sparks.
Seems to be middle of the road MSG to accomodate Barden's now limited capability.
And Barden cannot range the lyrics as before.
The cat is out of the bag on this band on Into the Arena.
I was kind of disappointed in this DVD.
The middle solo that Sparks and Galas used to give & take on is noticeably missing.
Plus the mixing is off.
Plus the song selection basically sucks.

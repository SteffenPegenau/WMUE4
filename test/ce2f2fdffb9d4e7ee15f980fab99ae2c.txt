Mariah wasnt out till like 9:30 !!
!
the opening act started at 7:00.
1st off she came out an hour late.
Her tour was not worth it !
I was bored to death.
just stood there stiff.
then she mad a big issue about the lighting and stoped in the middle of " Fly like a bird " and bitched and complained like the diva that she is.
I feel like I wasted my money on my ticket and why the hell would i buy this dvd.
in other words if you didnt go, you didnt miss much of anything.
lol.
she did all the hits , but never danced once.
I have always been a huge mariah fan since i was little so this was big for me.
This was the 1st time I would be seeing her live and lets just say....i expected more.
I went to the Adventures of Mimi Tour in NYC @ Madsion square garden.
I love mariah to death but i dont know i just wanted it to more entertaining , more lively.
THATS TOO LONG.
LONGEST IVE EVER WAITED FOR A MAIN ACT AT A CONCERT.

This is the third Olympus camera I have owned, with the last one being a C50.
Very sturdy and fashionable2.
Simple point and click if you want, or you can customize almost all aspects of a shot.
It's the best of both worlds.5.
Great metal body.
Could do better at taking wide angle shots.
A ton of value at 300 bucks.CONS:1.
Load time when turning camera on with a large memory card is very slow.
Overall, I am very pleased with the camera.PROS:1.
Great camera for the price.
Takes great pictures for a point and shoot.
Canon is better in this area.Overall, I recommend this camera for those looking for a great point and click camera.
Plan on waiting 5 seconds for the camera to enter "ready mode" with a large memory card.2.
Bright pictures and the color is very good3.
Nice size.
Can fit in a pocket, but you will notice it, but easy to carry around at parties and family functions.4.

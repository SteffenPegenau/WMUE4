This movie shows what kind of person Tina is: strong.
She stood by her husband Ike, despite the fact that he did drugs, slept with other women and beat her.
After years of working and touring, finally in 1983 Tina hit the charts with the cover of Al Green's "Let's Stay Together".
As a little Anna Mae Bullock, she was abandoned by her parents.
Wow!
But enough is enough.
Tina started to rebuild her career as a solo artist but it wasn't an easy job.
Great story, great music, great performances.
Laurence Fishburne was amazing in his role, he was very scary, and it just made you hate Ike for being so evil.
When they cast Angela Basset to play Tina Turner, they made an amazing choice.
This is a perfect movie.
Tina made the greatest comeback ever.
She has Tina's facial expressions down pat and an amazing figure too!
She left Ike and finally got a divorce.
I never knew that Ike Turner was such a monster.
Tina couldn't stand it any longer.

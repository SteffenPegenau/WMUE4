I have tried wearing this a few ways, none are real comfortable.
I'm not comfortable putting my credit card and drivers license in the slots build into the bag.
I want to love it...but I don't.
I didn't want to place it in the larger area's and rifle through stuff to get to it.
My wallet fit just OK in the second largest pouch.
I wish the bottom had a different material to clean after setting it down in various places.
Overall the material is durable.
I can fit a 16 oz.
So, I have decided to return it.
The otter box makes the phone too big for this space.
My iphone with otter box fits in the side pocket with flap, but not on the strap.
My wallet is a trifold and the width didn't work real great.
I like the size of the bag and pouches.
contigo coffee cup in the pouch.
The strap cuts into my neck.
My ipad with otter box fit in the big pouch but made the bag heavier than I'd like.

So far I have found this book to be somewhat interesting.
Molly, David's new step mom is nice.
Blair, the youngest boy in the Stanley family and my second favorite because he seems to have natural supernatural powers.
I can only say that I have liked the first half.
He says that she was into the super natural just as Amanda is.
The new Stanley family seems to be a weird combination.
I really don't think I like Amanda, David's new stepsister.
One minute she talks to David like a sister and the next she ignores him.
So far she has been unpredictable.
I am in the middle of reading "The Headless Cupid".
And it looks as though it is going to get much weirder.
So far it has introduced the characters.
I am a little confused about David's real mom, who died.
David seems to be the main character and also my favorite.
I have yet to finish the book so I can not say for sure if this book is good or bad.

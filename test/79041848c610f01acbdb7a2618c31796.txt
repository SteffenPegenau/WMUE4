I've been listenting to Fred for 18 years!
He's done it again.
His music is so personal and diverse.
If you like Fred, you'll love this one.
I saw Fred in concert in February in Kalamazoo MI.
I'm never disapointed with his music.
(drove 200 miles to see my boy!)
and it was well worth it.
He cna keep your head bopin' and he can bring you to tears all on the same album.

He is my favorite artist across ALL genres of music.
His sound is unique and his vocal quality only gets better with time.
This record is appealing and honest.
His personality shines right through in his music.
I honestly can't rank his albums one behind the other, they are all first quality and ranked #1 to me.
I'm an long time listener.

"Your dreams are filled with blood and gore.
Now they're right outside your door.
They're gonna get you!"
I have very eclectic musical tastes.
First let tell you that I am a 35 year old male.
Every track is spot on the money.
I am more impressed with this album than most albums that are released today.
1200 CD collection and growing all the time.
The other recordings are good but Bread and Jam for Frances is top of the heap!
Very moody, well written and well produced.
Every single track is an absolute gem.
I have purchased Switchblade Symphony's other works and this is by far their best effort in my opinion.
This is a listen to all the way through album at it's best.
My favorite band of all time is hands down Jethro Tull and I'm a Parrothead (a Jimmy Buffett fan for those of ya that don't know).
Switchblade Symphony's Bread and Jam for Frances is a perfect album.

I only used it for the exams (again only focused on Reading and Math sections).
I saved the writing for the day before the exam.
I got through this book in 1 week!
I took the exams in the back of the book.
I graduated from college 10 years ago.
It was easy to get through and the right answer explanations were detailed.
I got that book as well tried one of the exams and the questions were way too hard!
Good Luck!!!
I only focused on the Reading and Math section!
I wanted to mention do not use Kaplan!
I got that book because it had 4 exams!
Exams freak me out period!
It will give you an unnecessary headache!!!
I would say the Cracking the CBest book is all you need!
!
Also I used the Cliff Notes book.
This book did not do a good job in explanations.

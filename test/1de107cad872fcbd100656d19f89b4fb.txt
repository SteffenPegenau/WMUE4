There was either one of actors present or none at all.
Not until the next scene.
There is nothing about rebirth and nothing about howling at all.
I expected a 2011 movie to be worthy of watching, this movie was not worthy of my time.
Not an epic failure, but it's bad.
In example when school was burning, the fire looked so bad.
Not an epic failure, but boring.
The werewolf costume looked so cheap actually, especially the legs.
When 2 werewolves collapsed, you could well see that there is no life captured in those costumes.
However there were times when you could see how cheap it was.
It had good special effects compare to B movies.
Could give it another name.
I don't think there is really any point in writing more about the movie itself, it was so boring to watch.
But why this movie?
I would NOT consider it to be another Howling movie.
It's out of place.
Yes, howling is notorious for a few good and most bad movies mixed together in one huge sequel/collection.

Instead we get the story of this wierdly neurotic ex-cop turned insurance-adjustor/profiler.
Well I guess they had to have the sembalance of a plot.
When they try to get back to the plot for too long, it gets tedious.
This could very well be a sit-com.
That's what they got.
Mettalica rocks.
It's very funny is spots.
Michael (Joseph Fiennes) saves the insurance company lots of $$$ traveling cross country investigating strangely stupid deaths.
You know what's going to happen but it's funny anyway.
More in the way of dark humor.
Lots of great cameos especially Adam & Jamie from Mythbusters.
Before or after this movie I'm not sure.
This movie had the potential to be much better.
More explict, really funny idiots offing themselves, doing us all a favor by not breeding.
His partner, played by Wynona Ryder is a veteran adjustor & doesn't really get him or his theories.
You know: one stupid fatality every week.
They actually did bust several of these deaths on their show.

I'll never buy another Oster product again.
Maybe I can get at least get my $20 bucks back for this latest Oster fiasco.
I bought this one for $20 bucks figuring that the last one was just a fluke.
What is Oster up to?
Pressing the bagel button doesn't do anything.
They obviously don't test their products.
It didn't work properly.
This one doesn't work either.
Nope!
I should have known better.
I bought the Oster 6329 toaster prior to this one.
Well, that was a $30 toaster.
Don't do business with Oster.
$50 bucks for two different toasters and I still don't have a toaster that works!
Frozen waffels were soggy on one side and the bagel setting didn't turn off the outside elements.
Surely, right?

I just hope he leaves out all the advertisements.
Either that or he is getting some sort of kickback from the entities he names.
CNN?
However, I was a little taken aback by the "advertising" in the first few chapters wherein he used name brands a bit too much.
I must admit I had trouble putting the book down once it got going.
Either children of today are very enlightened on fashion and the arts, or the author is directing the story to an older age group.
The Disney Channel?
Berluti shoes?
And Arthur Miller's play, "The Crucible"?
The adventures of the "Children of the Lamp" is a very entertaining and captivating book.
Perhaps my own world is smaller than it seems?That being said, the storyline is quite good and I do look forward to the next installment of "Children of the Lamp".
Fox Kids?
(To name but a few).
Jimmy Choos?
I don't know a lot of adults who either know of it or have seen it.
I get the feeling the author is writing to a very "hip" and financially secure generation.

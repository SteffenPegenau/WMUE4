The second lock clamps around the top hitch.
It took my wife 5 minutes before she could unlock it.
The mechanism is simple.
This was easily accomplished.
My wife had to remind me that this was a 77 dollar gate and I shouldn't destroy it in a fit of anger.
It's just so difficult to get the thing to unlock.
There are two latching mechanisms.
This is were it all fell apart.
I realized the tolerances on this lock were so tight that any hope of one handed unlocking would be impossible.
I took me an hour adjusting the mounts and eye screws that help you level the gate.
The first requires the user too lift the gate out of its dock position.
The installation was pretty straight forward until you have to align everything.
May in version 2 they will fix this.Chris
I finally got the gate to easily rest in the mount.
I was initially impressed with the all steel construction of this baby gate.

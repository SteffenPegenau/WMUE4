.
Once you start cleaning, the steam only lasts for 10 minutes or so then you have to let it heat up again to continue steaming.
It's worth getting!
.
One container did clean A LOT OF surface area, but I did have to let it re-heat 3 or 4 times in one cleaning.
The cleaning job it does is superior to anything else I have tried.
THUMBS UP!!
Overall .
Still not enough of a drawback to not get it.
This is an amazing steamer.
It is not a retracting cord and the extra pieces (the ones that don't fit in the storage compartment) are large.
.
.
I highly recommend it.
!
These are the only glitches that I could tell so far .
Storage is a little difficult.
(Not a major problem though.)
.
Also, it does take about 8 or so minutes to heat up.

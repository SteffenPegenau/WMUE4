My son doesn't like them for this reason.
the text and story line are creative.
Just too negative and a little scary.
No fun times or successes.
), lost in the woods and rained on...etc!
All of the sheep books are theme he should like but he doesn't enjoy them at all because calamity after calamity and then the story ends.
The rhyming and rhythem are fun.
Anyway, I wish he like them because they are nicely illustrated and creative.
the illustrations are nice.
this review could be for any of the series, whether the jeep wrecks, the storm aboard ship and subsequent sinking of the ship (and why are they pirates?!
He does enoy stories where their is a problem or a challenge and then solutions.
But why does everything always go wrong in these books?
Nothing to attract him to the books.
Not exactly realistic but clear and uncluttered, not an exagerated cartoonish style of so many children's books.
Problems, a few solutions and promlems.

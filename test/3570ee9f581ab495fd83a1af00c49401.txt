I went into Sears to get the Kenmore, which consumer reports said was the best.
I sometimes saw it almost pulling the tiles off the floor.
It made me wonder what it is not getting.
At times, I would have to move the vacuum over visibile debris several times for it to come up.
I had seen the awesome reviews on amazon and did not understand why CR would differ.
In short, for this kind of money, I expect better.
We can see it pulling up a lot of stuff.
I just found out I can return it, and I'm going to the store now.
No doubt, it has tremendous power.
To make a long story short, the dyson is a disappointment.
No doubt, the power is there.
An saleman told me it was great and that only one other was better: the dyson.
But it is not effective.
When using attachments, the performance was solid.
It was even worse on floors.
But then I realized, it is just pulling off carpet.

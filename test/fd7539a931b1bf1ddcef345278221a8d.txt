Half his body stuck out of the back of the tub.
Too big for the sling & not old enough to have total head control.
Please do your research BEFORE buying..
Perfect in fact, but he reached 25 inches at 2& 1/2 months.
It is deep enough where he can sit unassisted & its great.
I got another tub the Safety First & so far so good.
Keep in mind you can't lay them down cause there is that hump there.
It'll save you some time & energy.
so in all it wasn't that bad.
This tub is so nice looking.
When my son was an infant it was great.
I had to hold him the WHOLE time.
I took out the sling & wow what a horrible time.
I did call Fisher Price & they had me send it back & gave me a voucher for anything else I'd like to get.
It was horrible.
Fisher Price really put thought into how the tub looks.

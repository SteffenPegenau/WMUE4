It was all broken up and part of it was mashed in.
The worst part about this tripod is that the single stick that's suppose to come up from the middle will NOT come up at all.
It was horrible.
I had a $5 tripod at Wal-mart and it worked perfectly fine.
This was not worth the money.
The box was not handled with care.
Everything was top notched.
But this tripod was horrible and it will not work properly.
The top part of the tripod (where you put your camera on) was very loose (even when it was tightening).
It also had a weird mercury smell to it.
I highly recommend getting a different tripod.
I thought some one had gotten the tripod and played soccer with it.
I might end up going to Wal-Mart and get myself a different tripod.
The legs were hard and sticky to get out.
When I open the tripod everything was stiffed.
When I first got the box for this tripod.

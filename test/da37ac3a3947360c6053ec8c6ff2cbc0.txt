Reason being, that I heard it completely copied GTA3 and Vice City, which are both great games.
All in all, this game is a masterpiece, my favorite game of all time, and one of the best games made so far.
The plot is simply amazing.
You play as Tommey Angelou a cab driver who accsidently gets wound up in the Mafia of Chicago(im guessing the location).
Let's begin with the graphics.
Perfect!
It's literaly like playing a movie.
When I bought this game I wasn't quite sure that I was going to enjoy it.
People's expressions and movments are totaly fluid and life-like.
The voice acting is great, not mellowdramatic or overdone in any way.
The game it self.
They're amazing.
The end is incredible.
Jesus Christ!
This game is rated M due to sexsual references, violence, blood, and language.
I began to play this game and I was amazed.

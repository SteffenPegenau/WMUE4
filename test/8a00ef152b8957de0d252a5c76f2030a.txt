A new Celine.
In my opinion, it's even better than Falling Into You!
WARNING!!!
A New Day Has Come is Celine's BEST work since Falling Into You!
She was so magical that night and she's magical on this album too!
Dare I say this is Celine Dion's best album ever???
And there are SO many GREAT songs on this album!
I first heard some of these songs at the taping of her CBS Special.
Yes!
Yes I will go that far!
Do NOT buy this CD if you DON'T love GREAT music!!!
A new day has come.
It's like a new artist.
I've never heard Celine sound so fresh as she does on this album!
The song "Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)" had tears running down my face!

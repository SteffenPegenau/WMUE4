And updates to McAfee products are more frequent than even Microsoft.
I sent the older version CD as proof of upgrade, and I sent the only UPC on my box.
1000 words may not be enough for a review.
And try updating all components at the same time, and watch the fun of rebooting.Even if you can live with all this, their REBATE is BOGUS.
McAfee seems to have an old habit of rejecting rebates.
And DAT files are updated in bunches of 30-40.
It seems that is still not enough.
Bad product.
Firewall is so good that even if you ask it to remember some program to allow, it still asks you, very loyal firewall really.
At least I won't.
1 year expiration is so well enforced that it can cause your O/S to go bad, I had to reinstall my Win2K.
And if you have a dialup, don't even think McAfee, imagine downloading 10-13M files every 15 days.
Either McAfee cheats or Amazon is lying re the rebate.
You need to manually uninstall previous versions, otherwise God help you.
Don't buy McAfee ever.

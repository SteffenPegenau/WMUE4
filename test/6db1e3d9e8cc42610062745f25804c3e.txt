Keep an open mind, but don't think that you have to like it.
So, of course, I tried Morrowind.
The combat and magic systems are terrible.
I can see where the love comes from - Morrowind is a party of aesthetic goodness.
However, I can also see where the hate comes from.
To be honest, most people either love or hate this game.
I've played the big names, and whichever of the little ones I could find.
It also has a great community backing it up with fantastic unofficial add-ons.
I love RPGs, both PC and console.
The NPCs are lifeless and their dialogue equally drab.
It boasts a gigantic world where freedom reigns.
That's the only way you'll know where you stand.
If you get the chance, try the game first.
With freedom comes a feeling of aimlessness.Don't get too caught up in the "Game of the Year" title, or rave reviews - bad reviews neither.
I do lean to that side after all.

Well, I'm 11, so this game was a dud.
Well, I'm done critizing this game.
You can't even see your Sim kiss or hug or tickle anoter Sim.
:( The were so ugly!
Bye!
It shouldn't have been in the stores!
And by the way, there are A WHOLE LOTA GLITCHES!
It was a big dud!
I got this game like, 3 months ago, and the reason why I never play it it's because it's just not a game to rave on and on about.
The game ended too quick- for me, at least.
The graphics were a so-so, and the clothes- Ugh!
You can't even build a friggin' house for cryin' out loud!
Maybe They wanted it to be ''kid-friendly'' for the younngsters under 8.
And the pick-up lines- PATHETIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I didn't think the other Sims were too good either.

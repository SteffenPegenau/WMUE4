I almost cried.
This story surrounds Helen (Kate Hudson) who works at a modeling agency.
This movie was far above my expectations.
She has never had to take care of kids ever.
I think everyone should go see this movie, especially moms.
It just has some issues about growing up.
!
Go see it everyone!
Kate Hudson does another fantastic performance.
Helen first thinks this is absurd because her older sister has children and is more mother like than she, but she ends up taking them in.
She learns how to be a mom and things go wrong.
When I went in to see this movie, I knew it was going to be sad, but not so sad.
Everything is going well for her until she finds out her sister and her husband died in a car crash and they left in their will custody of their three children to Helen.
I am so impressed.
She fits the part perfectly.
This movie was excellent!!
It has a few inappropriate parts, but not very bad at all.

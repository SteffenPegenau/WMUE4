Most people will be digging "The Crystal Method Vs.
Five years ago I got burned out on these remix CDs.
They are pure genius.
They are still going strong.
Most of the tunes are totally reworked.
The Crystal Method have become an elite force in techno music.
The Doors."
PMT "Gyromancer" is a great opening track.
The Crystal Method rules.
My intro to them was many years ago.
"Bizarre Love Triangle" is a track that has rocked the dancefloor for almost twenty years.
They make me proud.
But The Crystal Method have made the format interesting again.
Other tracks by Uberzone, New Order, UNKLE, and Smashing Pumpkins make this record unique and diverse.
There were just too many of them.
The music sounds like a totally new experience.
The LA ties are strong.
They are from Los Angeles.
Most of these songs are remixed and tweaked.
This new Hyper Mix is solid.

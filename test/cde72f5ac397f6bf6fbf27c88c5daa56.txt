I know how to play multiplication bingo.
What I wanted was the reproducibles.
The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is for the person who doesn't have a clue where to start.
Do not buy this book expecting to find the Holy Grail of multiplication.
There is only 12 reproducibles in this book.
Only buy this book if you can not think of one single multiplication idea.
For people with an imagination or some experience this book is a dud.
I know how to set up multiplication problems with beans.
This would be a good book for them.
TWELVE!!!!
After 4 years of hand writing multiplication sheets for various children (max class size is 4) I wanted to be able to scan and copy.
I even know how to make flash cards.
This book has it's uses but what I wanted was more reproducibles.
I am flat disappointed.
Guess what...
Out of 71 pages... Are you kidding me!!!

Kind of a dive for two celebrated actresses.
Kinda depressing.
End of story.
Kind of a film festival-type film.
Two old maids take him in.
While Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are fabulous actresses, I had a difficult time with this plot.
He goes away and becomes a concert violinist.
There was no climax, no real problem solved.
They even threw in the f-word to try to attract certain audiences who evidently enjoy hearing those types of words.
He is healed.
Judi Dench falls in love with him.
In fact, there wasn't one.
I don't enjoy the kind of plot where a poor old maid realizes for the first time in her life that she hasn't ever had romance, and probably never will (especially if she keeps falling for young men).
Mysterious young Polish man gets washed ashore.
He plays the violin beautifully.

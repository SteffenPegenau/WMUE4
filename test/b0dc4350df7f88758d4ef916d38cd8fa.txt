Whoop de doo.
But what kind of advantage is that.
The man she falls for, to the point of insisting on being buried with when the time comes, is some guy who drifted into her life for a week while her husband had taken the kids on a camping trip.
Who the hell is she?
I hope her husband had a few dozen girls on the side.
He's a photographer.
Meryl Streep is married to a wonderful husband who she completely fails to appreciate.
He's nothing.
It would be hard to find a more unappreciative or a stupider wife than the one starring in this movie.
Who will a woman be more excited about - her husband of 20 years or some handsome new guy who falls for her while hubby is away?
Sure he's a nice guy.
It is rare that I get offended by a movie.
Take a hike, jerk.
This ditz seems to think that she and her lover are doing the family a favor by not splitting up the family.
This one did it.

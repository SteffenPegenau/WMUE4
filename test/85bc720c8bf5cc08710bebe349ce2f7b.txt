aquabats - corny.
bad town?
just kill me now.
listen to me.
but I would imagine that almost every other one in the whole world rocks this pile of crap.
they are so good in their own right, but still have no business demolishing yellin in my ear.
I love op ivy like everyone else, from back on the h street videos, and it would be great to hear more from them.
buy this album and you're a total fool.by the way, most tribute albums suck.
weak as hell.
cherry poppin daddies?
does punk rock really does suck this much now that bad town (total classic) gets destroyed by those idiots?
in fact, now I'm pissed.
blue meanies.
this album is the worst worst worst album ever.
listen to me.
what a complete total wrong thing to do to one of the best bands ever.
what's the best band on here?
however, this is not it.
give me a break.

He is a broker and his whole career is based off money and making it.
Doesnt even compare!
Plus her whininess throughout the movie bugged me.
However, there were a lot of stories going on with no substance at all.
The acting by Shia and Michael was great.
First off Shias character and his girlfriend played by Carey Mulligan didnt make sense.
To me the movie was a lazy attempt to captalize on a classic.
Why are they together?
Didnt seem like they matched as a couple.
If you have seen the first wall street do not see money never sleeps.
She however, hates money and works for a non profit orginaztion and it very uncomfortable with have any money.
I am a huge fan a Shia Lebouf.
I think he is an excellant actor.
Already an hour in the movie I asked my husband if this movie seems to be going anywhere.
I watched the 1st one with Charlie Sheen and it has me glued to the TV.
This movie seemed like it was slopped together to make a quick buck.

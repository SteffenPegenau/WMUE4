Colin Dunne is no Michael Flatly.Now, for the two changes that are good.1.
But for some unknown reason, they keep changing it and many of those changes are not for the better.
For the same reason I've never really liked the Russian Dervish dance!4.
It's very good!
And the original version of "Lift The Wings" is by far the best!6.
I also don't care much for "Slip Into Spring."5.
The number called "Heartbeat Of The World."
However, this is not to say that the tappers are not incredibly talented, they're just not Celtic!3.
Yay Lugh!2.
Here goes:1.
The narration at the start the talks about The Sun!
I absolutely love Riverdance!
Firedance is much better in it's original version where it's performed by a man and a woman.2.
I've seen it live 4 times.
I don't see why the Trading Taps needs to be included.

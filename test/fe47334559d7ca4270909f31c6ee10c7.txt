Not a big deal.
He loves the old fashion look of the big expensive ones he has seen in department stores.
Only about a quarter of them don't pop.
It pops most of them.
Being he is only 3, I figured that this one was just the right size to fit on my counter top.
I also liked that it is an air popper.
It works for us.
I just put a really big bowl under it to catch the popcorn and seeds that are pushed out.I couldn't be happier.
It pops less than a bag of microwave popcorn and has to cool before you can pop more.
He LOVES it!!!
We wanted it for the look and the price.
My 3 year old wanted a popcorn machine for Christmas.
I don't recommend this for someone who wants a lot of popcorn at one time though.
It pops just enough for him with a little left for me and Hubby to snack on.
It doesn't pop all the seeds, but I had read other reviews about it and knew it would do this.
The top comes completely off for storage.
They do fall out though.
It is easy to clean and store.

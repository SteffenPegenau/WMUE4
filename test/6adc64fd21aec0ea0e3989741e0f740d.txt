Had to call tech support.
Changed the settings one time and it took it me the entire evening to get back to working condition.
Really don't know what I did.
Got it working just by fooling around.
Set up not simple.
I relied mostly on XP Professional to set the system up and avoided Netgear's proprietary software.
Connection currently is stable at turbo mode.
Are the other products easier to set up?
If they don't know, they send me to some website to look up my information.
Don't like tech support.
Always get people with accents.
Don't even know if it's secure.
Bought both the access point and card bus.
Not only are they difficult to understand, they were impatient.
One time they said they would call back but never did when I had trouble setting up the WEP security access.

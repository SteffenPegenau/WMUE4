In the end, the button is lost.
The necktie becomes a handkerchief.
I truly enjoyed this book.
The vest becomes a scarf.
In this story, Joseph has an overcoat that is worn and old.
He claims that you can take nothing and make something.The pages in the book have cut-outs.
Joseph writes a book about his overcoat down to his lost button.
He makes the overcoat into a jacket.
The handkerchief becomes a button.
The scarf becomes a necktie.
The reader should look at the illustrations and read the newspaper clippings.
As the story progresses, the jacket becomes a vest.
Children can use their imagination and guess what Joseph will make next.
There are several cultural items in the illustrations that a teacher could use to discuss the culture.
There is more to this story than the text itself.

Merry Christmas.
Both actors as always earn their wage.
Praise jesus~shauns movie review
It had the the making of something great but fell into the definitely decent category (dd).
Thanks.
They could have tied up loose ends.
Godbless.
I did however although refreshingly different events happening think it lacked that certain something for greatness but overall was still a nice movie with a somewhat or semi happy ending.
They could have wrapped up Larry's relationship with julia r. and the young female bff more.
if there is no sequel.
I would have enjoyed them re-writing this a little to give it that pizazz.
Idk but I definitley got my money's worth from this film and gladly add it to my movie night recommended list.
And its a persnoal peeve when they do that, esp.
Seemed like the girl liked him a bit?
Very entertaining, full of quality and spunk.

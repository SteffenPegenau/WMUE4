Would I come here and make excuses because I like him?
Would I buy it?
Absolutely not.
He's a performer and we're the customers.
I was actually happy to have the PBS Pledge Breaks.
Ditto.
I watched it on TV and switched the channel after the first hour.
Josh Groban's "Greek" concert is TERRIBLE.
PERIOD.
Whether I want to buy it or not is my decision, but this is the place for REVIEWS and I'm chiming in with mine.
As a matter of fact, he's not even trying here.
Josh Groban is a singer, making money off his trade.
I need my money more than Groban does and I work harder for $20 than Groban.
He may be a nice guy but that's pretty easy to do when you're a very, very rich guy.
The man is nasaly, warbly, strained and looks like a bum.
What I expect is someone who actually can sing through a concert and that is what I would buy, not this mess.
!And now they're trying to sell the DVD!!
Good Grief I can't believe this poorly done, badly sung concert!

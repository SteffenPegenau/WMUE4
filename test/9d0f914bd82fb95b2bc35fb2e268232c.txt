yes there are some neat-o things, but i got a bigger thrill from reading angels and demons from dan brown.
why is it that hollywood cant let things go?
mr cage you are NOT elvis presley.
indiana jones has been made.
stop with the collared shirts.
how many times must there be an attempt to place indiana jones in a different locale, different era, with a different cast?
and this, by far, is one of the longest leaps hollywood has made in the "stick-to-the-crap-that-has-worked-before" plan.
the storyline to this film is ludicrous at best, and barely researched.
he could have had a great career.
youre also balding, so when they throw a toupee on you in every film, everyone kinda chuckles.
nicholas cage.
entertaining, but silly.
everything was looking so good, then his complete obsession with elvis somehow took over.
it came out 20 years ago, and was a hit.
two sequels of excellent quality followed.
its a silly movie.

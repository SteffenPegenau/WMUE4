Even if he is getting younger, he didn't know that.
BUT i wanted to warn ppl to not read it if you want to read the cleric quintet(it'll give the ending away).
Also, i found the two wizards, that's right, 2 major magic users in the book!, refresing.
Danica,Ivan, and Pikel are a diff.
IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON READING "THE CLERIC QUINTET" ANYTIME IN THE FUTURE, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK OR THIS REVIEWWell, i'm not all the way done with it.
So far, I've loved this book!
I hope he doesn't appear in any more books.
story!
Stumpet finding the Crystal Shard was a big surprise to me.
Pikel is by far my fav.
Grr...Sorry, but he really irritates me, because i can't forget what he did to Danica.
I don't think this book is predictable, like many do.
The only reason it's not getting 5 *'s, is because it had Cadderly....Since I've read the Cleric Quintet, i've hated him.
character!
I don't care if it was a test from Denier, he shouldn't have risked it!

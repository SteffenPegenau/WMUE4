Ok, lets get one thing clear before I begin: I am a massive Nirvana fan.
Now i am not the one to answer this, but perhaps they are merely rhetorical questions.
However, it is the principle of this album which has aggravated me enough to convey my emotions upon paper.
Now i ask you do you really think, if Kurt Cobain was alive today, he would appreciate this?
.
Of course i appreciate that the album couldn't contain all the greats.
Ok. Now we have established that we can start on this.
You want the best of Nirvana you buy all the albums.
When i saw the track listing I was surprised at see the glaring omissions from this album.
There are to many to go into to.
This of course, defeats the object of a "best of" nirvana.
Would he want this?
The music is timeless.
Nirvana were one of the greatest bands to grace the earth.
A thing they were not, was sell-outs.

for 1 thing the Simpsons is a great show so it shouldnt have a scummy video game like this one.
I rest my case.
I have been a simpsons fanatic for the past 5 years and am humiliated by this ...video game.
The lines get dull + repetitive in 10 minutes and most of the lines are from old simpsons episodes.
They dont even have all of the characters.
The mission mode is unbelieveably sinchy.
5.
The graphics are bland, their entrances to the car are absurd.
(Hans Moleman doing a flip into a car?!)
they must have been on a low budget making the game.
This is just [an]... imitation of some game i forget the name of........ oh yeah, CRAZY TAXI!!!!!!

They decide to remove the late 50's Godzilla remains from the ocean and use them to build their weapon, MechaGodzilla.
But still, this is a good DVD to get, and if you're a fan of Godzilla, then you should own this cool flick.
The main plot is Japan trying to build a weapon that can stop Godzilla.
So, many scientists gather to try and come up with a solution.
More monster fights would have been better.
The only gripe I have is that it could have been a bit longer.
He is called Kiryu.
As far as the fighting goes, that is done pretty well to.
They are both done very well I think.
There are two battles between the two.
Well, this is the 26th movie for the big G. This movie is pretty good in my opinion.
There were far too many human scenes in my opinion.
MechaG looks better than ever, and even has a name in this movie.
She pulls off her job very well.
The main character seems to have many problems and she is very captivating to watch.

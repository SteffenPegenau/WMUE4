It fell from 35-ft high, landed base handle first onto the ground.
I removed the battery from the base section.
35-ft up, the branch pinched the bar and it was stuck.
Very easy to assemble sections.
I saw no damage visually of the unit.
A very nicely engineered product.
It will cut a heck of a lot of small branches and 8" sections too.
Chain and bar are very easy to remove and replace after sharpening.
Tied a rope around the branch, while on the ground I pulled and tugged until the branch snapped and set the unit free.
Great for cutting as advertised.
Short version: Its great to have around!
I would suggest having an extra charged battery on hand.
I slipped the battery back in, it started right up and has been doing great ever since.
While in my bucket truck, cutting a branch approx.
The light weight is a very big plus.
Keeping the chain oiled & the bar greased is important.

"Too busy, it's Christmas."
I contacted adgtron by email.
I left numerous messages.
I also emailed them several times.
Later, they called my home phone and left a message to call 954-482-5599.
Why would I rate them anything when nothing is happening.Roger Heintz
No response.
What am I to do?
they said.
I called 5-8 times.
NOtice, I rated only one star because it would not allow to rate it a 0.
In December I ordered a Sony CDPCX355 300-Disc MegaStorage CD Changer from adgtron.
No response.
I am out my money with a piece of junk that doesn't work.
When it arrived it didn't work.
Each time, leave a message.

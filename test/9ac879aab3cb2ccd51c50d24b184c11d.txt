I am writing this review to save others from wasting twenty bucks!
I got burned on this garbage and am trying to save others.
It does not have even half the information it promises to deliver.
It vomits up a bunch of obvious general observations that a five year old could make.
I am shocked that they feel justified to charge people twenty dollars for this piece of junk.
There are plenty of REAL books on the law of attraction out there.
How can a book on the mind be so scatter brained?
It wastes page space on an entire song by the very wise genius- Christine Augulera?
This one is just someone scribbling random ideas on paper and calling it a book.
It is filled with typos.
Are you f ing kidding me?
This ebook is a piece of garbage.
I really can't see how amazon permitted this to enter their product list.
That's all it's really worth.
Now I know why I see it at ebay for .98 cents.
What a joke.

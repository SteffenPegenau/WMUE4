He contradicts himself.
I can barely believe the Charlie Ellis wrote this.
It's like they just published his notes.
He skips across generations within a single paragraph.
About 150 of the 300 pages is fluff and adds nothing to the story.
It's just terrible.
How ironic that Capital Group takes a long term approach, launching new funds against the tide, while the people at Wiley (by launching this book before it was ready) have shown themselves to be a bunch of short-sighted money grubbers.
There's no structure at all.
What a great story!
About 1/3 of EVERY page is footnotes that add nothing.
He references chapters within the same chapter.
Capital Group has one of the most amazing long-term performances and is one of the most unique organizations in the industry!
But this book just stinks.
It's completely disjointed.
It's obvious the publisher was just in a hurry to get the book out to make a buck off the mutual fund scandal before the hype died off.

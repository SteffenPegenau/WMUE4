This model only has RCA plugs in the front.
Apparently they do.
If you are looking for a television with absolutely no thrills, buy this one.
What I did not realize was that this TV should be outdated.
It has none in the back.
Otherwise, spend an extra $30 to get stereo and plugs in the back.The picture is about what you would expect from a low end model.
It is not stereo sound.
But it got worse.
The price was right and I have purchased Sylvania TVs in the past.
First I noticed that the TV is mono sound.
I purchased this TV as a replacement for a RCA 24" TV.
The only plug in the back is the basic cable plug.
I guess this is what I get for making assumptions.
Do they even make TVs without stereo sound anymore?
You can do better for a little extra dough.
The sound from the one speaker is okay.

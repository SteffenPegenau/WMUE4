Okay, you finally got the thing open.
Hit the open button again.
You turn it back on, and it has NOT saved your previous location.
Sit down and grab the tiny cheap remote.
Stretch your arm way out to the side, take careful aim, and YES, you got a response.
It can't see the remote -- there's a slight angle to where you're sitting.
Wait, hit it over and over.
No, it's thinking.
Then hit the open button.
Press play.
Say you want to watch a dvd...
Okay, hit the power button.
This dvd player is painfully slow.
Arghh!
It turns off after a while.
Watch for a while, and pause it to make popcorn.
I hit the open button, but this is disabled.
Put in the disc.

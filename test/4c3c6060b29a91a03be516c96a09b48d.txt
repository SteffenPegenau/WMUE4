She goes to her Aunt Clare's house.
It looked the same as Aunt Clare's house and it had every little detail.
Aunt Clare hates the dollhouse because it gave her bad memories of her parents dying.My favorite part of this book was when Amy went to the attic to find a blanket.
I do not want to give it all away, but it was spooky.Other kids will like this book.
She is my favorite because she solves the mystery.
She was frightened and she hoped it was a mouse, but it wasn't.
She saw a light in the dollhouse.
She is alert and always on the job to find clues.
You never know what is going to happen next.
It is a great book.
Amy is the main character.
The reason I read this book is because it was a novel my class was working on.
It keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Aunt Clare is the sister of Amy's dad.Amy found a dollhouse in the attic.
Amy is sick of taking care of her sister, so she runs away.

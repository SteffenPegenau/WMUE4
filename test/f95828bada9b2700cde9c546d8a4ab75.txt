How fast do you need a salad spinner to go?
After about 3 years the spinning mechanism on the lid came apart on mine.
The act of pushing down hard on the mechanism over and over is just tough on a relatively cheap plastic object.
I was able to snap it together but it periodically comes apart.
All salad spinners have some variant of this problem, though.
Reading over some recent reviews I can't believe the belly aches.
Who puts a salad spinner in the dishwasher?
Why do I give it only 4 stars?
If you can't get the Oxo Good Grips salad spinner to spin fast enough to dry lettuce you are either over-filling it or you can't pump the easy ergonomic handle for some reason.
"Doesn't spin very fast".
Pull cord ones get tangled or rotted cords.
Go with the Good Grips - they're easy on the hands.
Just rinse the lettuce bits off and let it air dry.
"Doesn't fit easily in the dishwasher".
Crank ones wear out their gears.

She has freckles, and blue eyes.I really, truly did not like this book.
She renames her self Blister .The main character is Alyssa Reed also know as Blister.
I would though recommend this book to another person, if they like reality.
The baby is baby girl, her name will be Lila Rose.
Now that her parents are apart, she totally changes her look, attitude, and her name.
When her mom went to the hospital, she came back very, very sad.
Her parents are looking forward to a new baby on the way.
He also has a new girlfriend.
He also moved into an apartment of his own.
Her daddy moved them to a bigger town then what they are use to.
Alyssa Reed is a young girl that is ten years old.
I didn't like it because it had no mystery in it.
Days after that her mommy and daddy where very sad, they started fighting alot!
She is ten years old and she has red hair like a bright red apple.
Little Lila was born a Stillborn.
This book is a really good book for people who like to read this sort -of thing.

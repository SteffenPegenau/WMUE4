This is the fourth Binchy book I've read, and I was soooo disappointed.
She was so stupid and sickeningly sweet.
Ella, the main character, didn't have a brain in her head.
I'll wait before reading another Bincy.
Silver Wedding was next, which was pretty boring.
I then read Tara Road, which I just loved.
They do all the work, but then they send "poor Ella" to have all the fun!
I thought I had found a wonderful author.
The story line was poor, and the characters, except for Deirdre were not very likeable.
Then Quentins.
I couldn't stand how her married lover kept calling her "angel".
I was looking so forward to this book, but it was almost awful.
Too bad.
Evening Class was the first, and it was so charming.
Yuck.
And then when Nick & Sandy, who were working like dogs in their film studio, sent Ella to Manhatten to stay in a great hotel and be wined and dined by the film's potential financier - puhleeze!

I did get a workout, my arms!
Trust me, no other feature is worth anything on this stroller if you can't even manuever it.
Yikes, this thing was horrible.
That was my first choice and now I will be patient.
It's only one more obstacle to add into a mom's busy day.
I spent one afternoon in the mall and then drove straight to the store and returned it.
I thought, wow, something for my new one to sit in and my autistic six year old to sit in.
Skip this stroller.Rein
I'll have to live without an adult cup holder, but my sanity will be worth it.
Don't frustrate yourself and buy it.
Okay, it's a jog stroller, but the thing doesn't turn.
I was looking for something to keep my autistic one contained (he's a runner) and free up my arms with the baby.
I am on the wait list for the sit n stand.
I am on my third child and this is my fourth stroller.
I had to keep it in "wheelie" mode in order to turn it on a bend.

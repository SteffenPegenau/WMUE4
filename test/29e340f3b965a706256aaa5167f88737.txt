By morning there were 2 small puddles (4-5") at the bottom of each side door zipper.
We had five with room for all of our duffles.
It was a breeze to set up.
The real test, however, was when it poured rain most of the night on Sunday.
I purchased this tent and used it this week.
I think if we seal that area, it would be leak free.
We were quite concerned about leakage as we had not sealed any of the seams at home.
Took my husband and I about 10 minutes from the time we had it out of the box.
As stated before, a great tent at a great price.
The tetragon has 2 main poles and 2 secondary poles.
Figure about 7 adults maximum.
I've had other dome tents that were smaller but had more poles.
The tent is rated to sleep nine, but I think that would be quite crowded.
This tent is a fabulous deal.
I can't believe it comes at such a low price.

He just can't finish them.
For example when one of the guys, has to use the bathroom, and Molly asks if she can help.
Some watersports, OH YEA.
Each chapter was full of the usual sex, which was good.
To much space was wasted on the story lines.
I was dissapointed in the book.
But the most definite waste, was the ending of the chapters.
Or when the woman comes into the bedroom dressed as a dominatrix, once again the jerk ends the chapter.
I feel so ripped off.
That idiot, end the chapter.
The book and artwork where okay.
But just when the story is about to take a very interesting twist.
I am so mad and dissapointed.
I guess he is good at thinking of the idea.
The chapter ends.
I am wondering what next.

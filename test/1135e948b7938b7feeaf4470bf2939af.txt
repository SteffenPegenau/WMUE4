the real world seems overly bright and painted.
but my advice ... read the book.
but their scenes are too short and the tension and pain never has enough time to build.
the actresses were all well chosen and they are actresses i admire.
i could taste the blood and the tears when i read the book.
but the movie made things "nice".
they gave renee zellweger enough to work with.
that is all the movie is able to capture.
even though some of the dialogue was taken word for word, too many important things were left out and they feel dull.
her words aren't as sharp.
if given the chance, i think they would have brought the characters to life.
even ingrid is nice although there are moments.
except maybe the scenes with claire.
i don't know what more they could have done with the time restrictions.
astrid's world is stark white with shades of blue.
she doesn't make astrid bleed like she does in the book.

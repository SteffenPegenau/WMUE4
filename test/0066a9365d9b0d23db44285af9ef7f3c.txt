Us rap listeners can easily claim that you rockers sound retarded because all you do is scream.
WE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHING TO TALK TRASH.
But you guys sound so arrogant and stupid.
P.S.

OUTKAST IS THE BEST YEEEUH!!!!!
I can listen to anything.
Have you read his poems?
You havent heard all of 2pacs stuff.
You're gonna judge the guy's knowledge by his rap music?
Probably not.
Go on and maridnade on that.
I'm pretty sure he knew a lot more than you.
I havent heard this album yet.
Please dont be little arrogant prejudiced jerks about this stuff.
He went to college and stuff.
I just want to respond to all the trash that these rocker guys were talking about 2pac.
I don't only like rap.
BUT WE DONT.

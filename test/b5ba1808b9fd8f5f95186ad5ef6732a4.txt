First things first.
First, the second disc (the extras disc) doesn't load at all.
Batman Begins the movie rules.
Tomorrow I begin the process of trying to get Amazon to replace it.
Because the the two-disc special edition I received as a gift, that was ordered through Amazon, has two major flaws.
All I got in mine was the obligatory Warner Brothers catalog of Batman Begins merchandise ($125 for a sterling silver Batmobile keychain???)
and a Batman Begins branded flyer for Norton Antivirus (don't ask...I didn't even give it a second glance).
If it goes well, I'll update this review accordingly.
More than makes up for the dreck that Joel Schlockmaker did with the series.
Great cast.
I get the FBI warning, the Warner Brothers logo, then squat.
Second, it didn't come with the special 72-page book that I heard so much about.
Great director.
I loved it.
Why the one star, you ask?
Not on my DVD player, not on my PS2, not on my PC.
That's it.

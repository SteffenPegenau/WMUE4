Put pitas on tray, put sauce on pitas, put cheese on pitas, put tray in oven at 350% and cook until cheese bubbles?.
If you are getting it for the pictures and for kids to laugh, fine.
These are total common sense recipes.
Bam!
I'm going with two stars because this book is made for kids and does a good job at attracting kids with all its funny pictures.
Wow.
But for cooking (even for kids), no way.
The recipes are really very insulting.
picture book, right?
Now, do you really want to spend hard earned money on that?
And it is a cookbook rather than just another kids?
is ?buy a package of pitas, jarred spaghetti sauce and shredded cheese.
But come on.
What's with all the five star reviews?
Seriously, the recipe for ?Eat a Pita Pizza?

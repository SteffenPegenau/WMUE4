It took me of the highway and put me back on the highway several times.
The price was really good.
Th battery lasted less than 2 hours.
I was extremely dissatisfied with the unit.
The unit is very basic.
I checked the battery and it was dead.
Thanks to amazon.com's awesome return policy, I returned it.
On my way back, the gps just died.
I took it to a trip and did it let me down.
I was very disappointed when I used it.
I only needed a basic gps so i purchased it.
The initial directions were ridiculous.
Then, when i reached the hotel, I took the directions for a mall (which has been there for 10 years)...
The nice people at a gas station helped me get to the mall.
It said you have arrived to your destination but I was pretty far away from my destination.
The unit was off by 5 miles.

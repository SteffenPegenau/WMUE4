Lego star wars.
get the game damnit!
Thats about it.
I'm tough as nails!
I'm a tough critic!
I know what your thinking, "What the hell?!?!"
I gave Halo 2 a 4!
GOOD GAME.
The puzzles are fun, the lego characters are funny and inovative, free play mode with a bunch of SW characters is fun, and the hack 'n slash gameply is over all playable.What is bad?
The good stuff is the fun puzzles and collecting the "minikits" and filling up your "jedi meter" to get to the "?"
level.
Buy the game!
I was expecting a piece of crap considering how bad ALL of the previous lego games were.
No way!
Also, the game can be beaten in a measly 6 or 7 hours.
I would highly recommend this.
Too easy.
Ok, if you die, you lose 1000 studs, or money, and respawn in the same room.

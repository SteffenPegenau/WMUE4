If want truly mind-blowing lyrics amazingly delivered right on beat, Jay-Z is the artists for you.
2Pac: All Eyez on Me.
Jigga doesn't try to tell you how to live your life a certain way and sound like he is preaching(Nas has done this too much).
But for this fan, it doesn't get any better than this.
And this is him at his best.
All true hip-hop heads agree that this is top 5 minimum.
He is giving you poetry from the streets of Brooklyn.
And what are the other 4 best hip-hop cd's of all time you ask?
Outkast: Aquemini.
Jay-Z makes words ryhme that shouldnt.
It takes a couple listens to catch everything, like all great cd's do.
Holla.
Biggie: Life After Death.
This is not for those who started listening to rap because of Eminem and 50 Cent.
If on first listen you don't believe me, its cool.
Nas: Illmatic.

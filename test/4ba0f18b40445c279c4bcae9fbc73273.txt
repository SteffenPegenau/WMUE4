I resolved the roll by putting a towel as padding in between the stock and the rubber pad.
Fortunately I picked one of these up cheap at a gun show.
And it is holding up to the solvents, etc.
It seems to be designed for one specific size/style of gun.
I do like all the molded places to put things in the base of the vise.
Mounting my Saiga with Tapco telescoping pistol grip stock required all my jury-rigging skills :) but I got it to stay adequately enough to clean the gun.
I rate it as basically adequate.
One step up from not having a vise at all.
My Savage 10 .308 fits in it ok.
I would not have paid full price for it.
The vise held the gun horizontally ok.
I mounted it to do some scope work.
There are no adjustments in this model.
So, it's basically adequate.
The buttstock clamp caused the rife to roll slightly, moving the scope off vertical.

It heated food in a reasonable amout of time, but the food usually was not heated evenly.
It was manufactured in Feb. 2006.
I think I will go back to looking into that brand product again.
When one brand fails me, I buy a different brand.
Will not buy Sharp anymore.
Some food on a dish was hot, while some part of it was luke warm.In Feb. 2012, the unit all of a sudden ran with a horrible sound and stopped heating food at all.
All the while I had it, the unit worked fine.
Only after 5 1/r yrs, the unit dropped dead.
My previous microwave was a Panasonic that ran for took 16 yrs only to die in a flood.
I only buy a brand I can trust.
Bought this unit in June, 2006.
It wasn't hard to learn all the ins and outs of the keypad.
I never get taken to the cleaners twice by one company.
This is not what I would have expected from a Sharp product.
The only reason I didn't buy another Panasonic at the time is because it wasn't a choice at the time I needed to replace it.

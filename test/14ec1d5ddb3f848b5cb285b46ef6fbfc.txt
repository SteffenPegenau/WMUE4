Love Ya.
The title is outstanding.
Roz!
Perhaps that is the direction this book should have taken versus your main character's dilemma.
However, I know that there are going to be some "haters" as well because that's Satan's job.
I've gotten some positive feedback from my readers in my book, "Waiting to Exit Hell," because they were able to follow the writing style.
Although, however, this novel was somewhat too wordy and over-written.
However, I did like the idea how you were trying to capture the reader's attention on societal issues.
I write as though I'm talking to you over the telephone or in person.
Keep writing and delivering these thought provoking and positive messages.
We both were trying to deliver a message of "forgiveness."
It also had too many different themes flying in very many directions.
Our folks need to know!
Girlfriend!
I feel you.

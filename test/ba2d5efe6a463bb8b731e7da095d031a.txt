I'm hidious!
I loved the Broadway production.
How could something with so many lovely parts be so wrong?
And at the end when they pull off Eric's mask... the dude is handsome.
And the ending (which they had to change so people who read the book and saw the play would have something new to see) is depressing.
I can't believe I used up my "promise to see one chick flick with you" that my husband gave me on this.
Seriously.
But this film which I waited for with baited breath was so....... blah.
The costumes are devine.
Okay.
I own the book.
Don't look at me!"
The images are stunning.
The cast is beautiful.
For all of it's breathtakingly beautiful parts, the whole is a Frankenstein.
The music is haunting.
My husband leaned over and whispered, "Oh, no!
If the cover on a romance novel could come to life it would be this movie.
I've got a zit!

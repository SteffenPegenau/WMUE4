How bad could it be?Bad.
The characters had lost their depth, and the actors delivered their lines in a way that seemed forced.I should have followed my instincts and avoided this season.
Whereas before I would laugh until my sides hurt, Season 4 left me feeling uncomfortable.
Dismayed.
Not even a chuckle.
Let me start off by saying I loved Seasons 1-3.
After all, while Jeff was a great part of the show, he was not THE show.
Yuck.
Now I need to watch 1-3 to get the bad taste of season 4 from my mouth.
I have watched them again and again, but I resisted buying Season 4 because of Jeff's absence.
The writing was off, as was the acting.
The feeling of camaraderie was gone.
Wondering what had gone so wrong where everything previously had gone so right.It wasn't just Jeff being gone.
Painfully bad.I do not exaggerate here when I say I didn't laugh once.
Finally, I caved.

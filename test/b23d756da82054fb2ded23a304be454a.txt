I'm dissapointed.
It's really boring.
every record is unique and interesting.
Buy WILLPOWER or IN THE EYES OF GOD.
It's catchy yet dissonant.
Kiss the pig is the worst record of their history in my opinion.
It's not bad, but it's just not as good as anything else they've done.
They played technically proficient groove/jazzy beats.
This record just doesnt hold up.
I hate blast beats and grindcore beats.
TITD's drummers in the past did not do that crap.
grind beats have no feeling and maybe thats why this new Today is the Day record has no feeling.
I love Today is the Day.
Everything they have ever done is amazing.
It seems like it was just thrown together.

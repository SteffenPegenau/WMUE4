Waisted disc space that could have been used for say... the original "making of" documentaries, or perhaps the dredded Holiday Special.
This one thing that urks me though is yeah, you had to buy yet another copy of the 2004 really special edition.
It's nostalgic.
A. I love the fact that this was finally released.
Han shoots first, No Han telling Jabba he's a wonderful "human being".
This is how it should be.
Now, why do you include a demo with the DVD, and release the DVD the same day as said game.
Maybe good ole George forgot about that stuff.
The other thing, and this may be just a nitpit, is an extra on Disc 2, the demo for Lego Star Wars 2.
Whatever.
A little dirty, sound like crap and nothing more.
That just made no sense.
But still, it's worth it to me anyway.
Sure, it's the transfer from the 93 laser disc edition or something like that.
Atleast that would have made sense.

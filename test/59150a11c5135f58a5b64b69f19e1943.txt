And you know what?
But this sim has one thing most new sims can't duplicate.
This game is a lot of fun.
This is the sim by which I judge all other sims.
I mean, I've had this sucker for a while.
I keep coming back to it.
This is THE most well-rounded game I have ever played.
If you don't already have this game, do yourself a favor and get a copy.
When this game first came out it was the best, today Jane's Fighter's Anthology is still "The Mother of All Flight Sims."
You'll be glad you did.
True, the graphics aren't that great.
This is an old sim.
It has great scripted campaigns, and the learning curve isn't too steep.
The flight model (despite what that one guy said) is almost poor.
Perfect gameplay.

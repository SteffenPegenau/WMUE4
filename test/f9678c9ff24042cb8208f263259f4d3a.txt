A few scratches on the back, the screen was fine, and one of the scroll buttons does not work.
It is not worth it!
I did not need something with all the fancy features, just something to keep my appointments and to-do list.
I am fortunate because I decided to buy a refurbished m500.
No manual came with it, but that was easily remedied by going to the Palm website and downloading one.
It is a great product for $20, do not spend any more than that!
The Palm m500 does just that.
It is a basic unit that was difficult to sync to my computer.
This would be equivalent to paying $100 or more for a VCR.
My preference is to have something separate.
For most people, their smart phone will do what they want.
The m500 works great, it just isn't worth paying the big bucks.
I searched for a long time to find a PDA.
As far as me buying a refurbished m500, I got what I expected.
Most I looked at were $100 minimum and I found mine for $20.

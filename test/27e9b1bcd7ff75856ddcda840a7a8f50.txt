The poem was symbolic.
The two poems that were given as examples can be considered another way.
Teachers come in with daggers in their eyes.
The poem of war is very descriptive and true to life.
Well, unlike the other two reviewers, I enjoyed reading these poems to my children.
I reviewed the book in the store before deciding to buy it.
You know about symbolism don't you?
My son started some prose immediately after.
What's wrong with getting the kids' attention, showing them that poetry isn't all stopping by the woods on a snowy evening.
The poem about the teacher was funny.
Many of these poems are great discussion starters.
Should war be viewed antiseptically?
Should children believe war is a good easy thing the way our current administration would have us believe?
My kids listened intently.
I've got tons of sweet poetry books for the early years.

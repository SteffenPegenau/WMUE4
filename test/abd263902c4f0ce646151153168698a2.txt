Yesterday I made one of the cakes.
I weighed, measured, was precise, even used a cake strip on the pan.
and there was a mistake in the recipe it said 8 tablespoons of butter was 5 ounces.
I am a decent baker, I like detailed descriptions, I thought this would take my baking to the next level.
I will try one more cake, but I am afraid that the recipes are just too precise and too demanding.
after 30 minutes the cake was too wet.
I just don't know about this book.And the cake was supposed to be flat, just because of the ingredients, and it was slightly mounded.
Although this is not usually a problem.
I wish I had ignored her and only waited five minutes.
.
Maybe I am having oven temp issues .
Too dry, too overdone.
I waited another ten, just like the recipe said, took the cake out.
When I got this book, I was thrilled.
Cooled it, glazed it, snd when we ate it, it was like dust.

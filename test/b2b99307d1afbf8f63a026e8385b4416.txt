In other words, what they do, they do well.
It was hard to tell the difference between some songs when I first bought the CD.
I do like both bands by the way.
But if your expecting chaotic tunes throughout the CD like "Dig", consider not buying this (instead go with their big brother Slipknot).
They are one of the most unique looking and sounding bands.
The lyrics, guitar riffs, and drum beats do vary, but not enough to make it better.
Now the bad stuff.
They look awesome, and sound awesome.
If you want "quieter" (compared to Slipknot) and more "thought provoking" music go with this.
Their lyrics are completely different!
Both bands are good though!
First of all, let me give them credit.
Dig is also an awesome music video and song.
As for the whole thing about the Mudvayne-Slipknot comparison, they only sound a little similar.
All the songs (except "Dig") sound almost identical!

You will be disappointed.
Telly and Big Bird have the biggest parts in the movie.
With Telly's help.
My son and i have watched this movie soooo many times!
It is GREAT if you love old sesame street.
Personally I love it because I'm a huge Cookie Monster fan, and this has his signature "C is for Cookie, It's good enough for me, C is for Cookie, Good enough for me!"
It starts with Snuffy wanting to know his letters and Big Bird says he will teach them to him.
I looked it up and it is actually from the 80s not 2010.
But if you are expecting Elmo and Abby the fairy.
Anyways.
Song.
I'm guessing they turned it to DVD in 2010.
This Sesame Street video is great!
Oh i love it!
Its old school.

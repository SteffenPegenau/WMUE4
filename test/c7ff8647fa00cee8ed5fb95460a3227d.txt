YAWN!!!
It just doesn't work.
For some reason, they are trying to turn him into Jerry Lewis.
Can't the writers come up with new material??
?The emphasis and where they went wrong with this movie is simple - it all comes down to makeup and fat suits.
Seen him in 3 other Eddie Murphy movies already!!!
Example - the typical old Jewish guy.
Maybe when it ends up in the $5 discount bin.
It isn't.It has some funny moments.
Not enough to justify buying this.
The commercials/trailers show the best scenes and make it seem like it is hilarious.
I am a huge Eddie Murphy fan.
No substance, all makeup.The script is lame, the jokes can be seen coming a mile away.
Some of the characters he did well, but many were over the top and many you have seen before.
All he does these days is play all the roles now in his comedy movies.

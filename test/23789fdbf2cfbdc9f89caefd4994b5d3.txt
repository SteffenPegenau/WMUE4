I know how to read and I read the instructions and followed them to a tee.
We re-did the whole thing and even then it just wouldn't put out enough paint to be useful.
I tried changing the batteries twice ... Duracell and Energizer.
Seriously, this is worthless.
Don't waste your time or money.
I'll be cleaning it out and taking it back tomorrow.
This piece of junk makes me question every product that Wagner puts out.
The "good" reviews are probably employees of Wagner.
After "painting" for two hours I only managed to get a 2x2 foot section of wall painted and even then .... it needs a second coat.
I'm not a moron.
Shame on me for trying to find an easy way out of painting ... turns out the old fashioned way IS the easy way.
No luck.
(I'm a woman) This is the biggest piece of junk and a huge waste of time.
I had my husband look it over to see if maybe I put it together wrong.
First of all, let me just say ....

A few novels ago, Lucas would sooner have his eyes put out with a pick axe than pander to the policial element.What was good?
And the political jockeying for position he's doing with Rose Marie...Puh-leeze.
It's implied that the killings happened suddenly but with 8 or 9 graves, it's clear it has been going on for some time.
I hardly felt anything when he did in his own mother - it just fell flat.
The dialogue.
And the whole 'porn/art' angle was intensly focused on then hastily dropped - SCREAMED plot device.
The villian wasn't very compelling or evil.
I've read all or nearly all of the Prey novels & found this one to be weak.
Way to dull your edge Davenport.
The pace.
It's like he doesn't realize what he's doing - oops, killed another one.
Lucas has gone soft.Sure Qatar was a killer, but he wasn't particularly riveting.
Very heavy handed, even for Sandford.And what is all this about a baby!?
But that's about it.
I got no sense of why he was the way he was.

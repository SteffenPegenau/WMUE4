The bag is designed by a photographer, for a photographer.
They have to fit the following requirements: 1, they must make it very easy to reach your gear, and change lenses on the fly.
Nothing has to be squeezed in.
They must not make you stand out.
They have to be ergonomic and comfortable.
They have to be big, and strong, and offer tons of protection.

It fits perfectly.
Having owned it now for only a few street photography outings, I repent of my short sighted procrastination.
I highly recommend it.
However, its the bags for personal street photography that offer the biggest challenge.
It is very rugged and has everything you need, and nothing you don't.
The bags for professional shoots are easy to select.
I have gone through dozens of bags over my decade long tenure as a photographer.
I have eyed the Domke FX3 for a very long time, but honestly, could not justify $150 for a compact canvas bag.

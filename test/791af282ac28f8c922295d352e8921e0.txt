I also printed photos of my son's wedding from a DVD.
Have printed out more than 30 cookbooks over the years.
Quality was as if I had taken them to the local corner drugstore.
I had a couple of documents that I needed to have scanned and was waiting for this to arrive.
And I expect this one to do the same.
I bought another brand top feeder several years ago.
Color was sharp, black and white very clear.
It turned me off of the all-in-one printers for a long time.
The ease of installation is phenominal.
This is my fourth HP printer product over the years.
I knew what cartridges were needed when I ordered this and took advantages of the free shipping by ordering several extra ones to have on hand.
Couldn't get rid of it fast enough.
Got this yesterday and installed it in less than an hour.
HP printers just keeps on ticking!
Ended up just giving it away.
Have been with HP ever since.
Also have purchased an HP computer.

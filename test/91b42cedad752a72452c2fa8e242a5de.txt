"I Don't Really Like You"'s chorus is good, but not the rest.
I wish I never bought this CD.
The songs sound a lot similar.
If you like Hilary or Lindsay, you will NOT like this.
If you like Ashlee Simpson, you will NOT like this.
Number One, Billy S., and Tangled Up in Me are the only good songs.
WRONG!
She talkes about not liking people and stuff like that.
If you heard Skye's Number One, Tangled Up in Me, or Billy S., you'd think that's the type of music on this CD, right?
Don't use money on this CD when you can buy a MUCH better one like Ashlee or JoJo.
And those are like the only good ones!
I used to like Skye a lot, but now things are changing.
This is overall a not-so-good CD.
All the verses of all the songs sound so much like the same.
All of the songs (except those three) are negative.
If you like JoJo, you will NOT like this.
There is nothing like that except those three songs!
The names of the songs are horrible!

If you let te food dry you might have to scub along with the wet towel.
It's easy to install.
Our table has a 5 inch skirt and fits fine with about an inch and half to spare.
Its gokng to a while before she grows into it .
I recently bought the chair or my 6 month old little girl.
It is easy to clean.
I bought it to replce the bumbo seats when we eat out.
You just need a wet towel to wipe off the food after each feeding an your golden.
No biggie.
Good construction and easily folds up to carry.
The only problem I have with it is that it's a bit big for my daughter as it sits her too far back away from the table and too low.
It's has and adjustable seat belt.
It's definitely made for older babies.
Its not a bi deal as she isn't feeding herself just yet.
So bumbo it shall be for another two to three months.
What i like!

If you don't like Trina, quit lookin at her reviews.
But she ain't weak and a majority of her songs go hard.
Trina got her every day and all day.
Quit hatin and go get a life.
Trina ain't weak and obviously she ain't weak because her albums sell more than yall make in a life time.
Also leavin you, heated (dissin Jacki-O) even though Trina and Jacki-O cool now, and many more... Trina is a Hot female MC!
Listen to Don't trip.
Here new song with Lil' Wayne.
That's off Glamourest Life.
She'll beat all these little female MC's but just a few.
You will be satisfied and B R Right alone is enough to go get the album Diamond Princess (Hot Album)I am just keepin it real.
She is at least ranked in the top 4 of female Mc's.
And this is real, Foxy Brown suck.
Trina, Lil'Kim, Remy Martin, Da Brat.Just go cop Trina new CD in July and yall find out.
People hate on Trina because they ain't got her body figure or MC skills.
Also Jackie-O.
!
I am just keepin it real.

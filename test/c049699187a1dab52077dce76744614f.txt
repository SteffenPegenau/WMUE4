***May Contain Spoilers***This movie felt unbelievably flat.
He didn't need extra ghosts to give the clients what they needed.
I would have much rather watched him deal with his gift and his oppressor than watch Matt and his one-dimensional family interact.Worth watching?
I would assume to make more money by having more ghosts around, but wasn't Jonah a true median anyway?
Rent it, though.
Give us more of the memento mori, more flashbacks of Jonah contacting spirits.
Sure.
All I got was flashes of "scary" images with a promise of better things.
What's great about scary movies regarding ghosts from the past isn't the paranormal, but rather the history.
The most interesting parts of the film were flashbacks to his life.
I felt totally cheated when it came to Jonah.
He looked so scared and confused.
It was never explained why the mortician used voodoo and dark magic.
Not enough to make us care about Matt.
I wanted to know Jonah (the dude on the cover with ectoplasm streaming from his mouth).
Yeah.

Angels Don't Kill2.
They are a great band that deserves alot of credit.
They, imo, are the leaders of melodic death metal.
Triple Corpse Hammerblow4.
Bodom Beach Terror7.
The only problem with this album is that after the song 'hate crew deathroll', there is still 3 minutes of silence.
I'm stuck there thinking, wtf?
You're better off dead6.
The riffs, the basslines, the drum fills, the black metal vocals, its all here.
Chokehold (cocked n' loaded)Best album of 2004.
but its all okay because its the end of the album so you can just stop it after the song is over.Best songs in order1.
Children Of Bodom have been around since 1997.
No doubt.
From the melo-thrash anthem 'Needled 24/7' to the end riff of 'hate crew deathroll' this album is perfect.
Six Pounder3.
Hate Crew Deathroll is one of the bands best work.
Lil' Blood red riding hood9.
Hate Crew Deathroll8.
I cannot stress enough how good this band is.
Needled 24/75.

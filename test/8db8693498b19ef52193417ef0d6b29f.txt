And I have only used it once every evening!!
It can become a huge problem if this broke at the work place!
How can people think this product is wonderful?
I really wish I would have read the reviews!
Can't believe AVENT puts so much pride in this!!!
Do not buy this product!
Esp.
the one about the neck cracking and breaking!
The plastic is cheap and faulty!
I bought this breastpump thinking it was great!
It was a nightmare at 4 in the morning!!!!
!
Also, a plastic valve part kept getting sucked through the neck which I would have to take apart and fix and put back together AGAIN & AGAIN!!!
TRUST ME DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
I wish I would have just shelled out the money for the Madela Electric because that is what I will be doing today!!
My son is now 7 weeks old and my pump has cracked at the neck and broken in 2 places!

Feel like it will fall off.
Plus the top plate doesn't fit flush up against the unit.
I was so excited to get this grill, to cook for a family of five.
Hope it doesn't!
The little grill has such a longer cord, and that takes up less room on the counter.
So you are limited to where you can put it.
It's ridiculous!
If you have crowded counter space, you need to move the appliance around; but the short cord doesn't allow you to do that.
I have the original small Foreman Grill, and I love it.
Some other people said that it did.
Plus I liked the fact that the plates are removable and interchangeable.
We make everything on it from grilled cheese sandwiches to steak, but it takes too long to make 10 hamburgers.
Very annoyed with that design.
So I thought this one would save time.
My only complaint is that the cord is so short!

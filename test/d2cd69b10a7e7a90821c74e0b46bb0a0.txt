Win zenie, watch movies, and beat the living daylights out of anyone who stands in your way.
Could life get any better?
Try to unlock all characters.
3: Anyone that hates this game is a nincompoop.Play through the story, enter the tournament, and customize to make the best character ever!
Guaranteed to make you laugh your head off, this is also a very funny game.
You can also enter practice mode to improve your moves and try out attacks.
Before I begin this review, I would like to state my opinions.1: DBZ fans only.
It practically destroys everything, I mean EVERYTHING!!!
2: If you think this game is too easy, than try medium, hard, or very hard.
I mean, did you see Trunks's Burning Attack?
Guess what else?
(Otherwise this game would be very hard to understand, and some inconsiderate fools just don't understand creative genius when they see it).
(One more thing.
(Like Hercule, what an idiot).
Cool).

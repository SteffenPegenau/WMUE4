Also graphics are too clean on the current seasons.
Going crazy trying to find out when season 7 and 8 are coming out.
I don't know.
I can't find anything.
Not nearly as funny or "raw."
Season 6 is very funny.Not too crazy about season 11 that is on TV now though.
Oh well.
Started seeing a slight subtle change in the characters during season 10.
There are sooo many people waiting for them.
Anyway, buy season 6...you won't be dissapointed!
My husband and I absolutely love this show!
Sometimes the lastest technology isn't always the best.
Don't they know that??
Maybe new writers?
I have seen many shows change for the worse that way.
Not quite the same.
Does anyone know?

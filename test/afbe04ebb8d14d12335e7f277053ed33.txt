I had to buy 2 replacments for batteries.
*Charge simply by putting on charger.
(I use doller store batteries in mine now)Pros*If used offen saves money on batteries.
Here are some Pros & ConsCons*Colors are random.
I originaly purchases these and the charge station back in 08.
Only 1 battery has managed to survive.
First off I should let you guys know that I own 6 of these.
*If not used offen batteries that get removed after playing are cheaper.
(or prior to gameplay)*Have to move it around on the charger to get charge to take.
The only one left that still works for me is the P1 conroller battery.
Yes thats right 6.
Currenlty it's year 11.
*Must recharge frequenlty.
*Some batteries don't live as long as others.
If you don't use the batteries fairly offen they just go stale.
*Adds a collored back strip to your controller to help distinguish your controllers from friends.

She starts out floor length and winds up in a tutu!
The tale is lurid.
It's all about the story.
Stewart Granger (Moreau) has to wind up with Janet Leigh (Aline), so what do they do with Eleanor Parker (Lenore) who has saved his life and has been sharing his adventures through the most of the flick?
The acting is delightfully overdone.
This is one of the best.
The villain is vile.
She's obviously not the kind of girl the hero settles down with at the end.Ignore this, or don't.
I'm not making this up!
Sabatini used to crank these out - Scaramouche, Captain Blood, The Black Swan - and they were great as books and they have made great movies.
The setting is exciting.
Watch her skirts getting shorter all through the final duel!
Sabatini could really spin a yarn and the old Hollywood could really deliver it.
This is still a spectacular movie.
Of course, they have to do some movie shorthand.

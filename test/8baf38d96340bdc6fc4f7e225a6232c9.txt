WELL, READINNG MY BEST PLAYS OF 1964-1965, THEY LIST THE SONGS ON OPENING NIGHT AND A BUNCH OF SONGS ARE NOT ON THE ALBUM AND SONGS ON THE ALBUM ARE NOT LISTED IN THE BOOK.
RECORDING ON VARESE SARABANDE.
THIS DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A BROADWAY CAST ALBUM.
NOW THATS A GREAT STUDIO CAST ALBUM.
I AM CONFUSED.
TO START OFF WITH.
IF YOU ARE A BROADWAY SHOW COLLECTOR THAN THIS SHOULD BE IN YOUR COLLECTION, OTHERWISE, I WOULD PASS.
SECOND,I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE SCORE FROM THE ORIGINAL SHOW.
IT SOUNDS LIKE AN OFF BROADWAY ALBUM BY LISTENING TO THE ORCHESTRA.
ALL THE PERFORMERS ARE FIRST RATE, BUT LISTENING TO THE CD, IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH.
IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE A BAND THAN AN ORCHESTRA.
ANWAY, WHATEVER IS ON THE CD IS FAIR.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY PICKED KELLY OVER MANY OTHER SHOWS THAT HAVE A MUCH BETTER SCORE THAT WERE NEVER RECORDED LIKE THE BODY BEAUTIFUL OR SHERRY OR LOVELY LADIES, KIND GENTLEMAN TO NAME A FEW.
PRETTY AVERAGE MUSIC.
TAKE A LESSON FROM THE DRAT!THE CAT!

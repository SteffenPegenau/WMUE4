If you find it, grab it.
First of all, if he wants, he can compose and play lovely tunes as much as he wants.
For very stupid reason; I have & enjoy many of Allan's recordings.
Anyway, I sold it for that reason.
Overall, it wasn't fantastic album indeed but yeah, right, I have been bumping my head to any wall around me and miss that three beautiful acoustic pieces.
I didn't have any problem to get this (Nowadays it is hard to find).
I was kind of afraid of having 'less-fantastic' Allan Holdsworth album.
(Gong) and his own solo album-Metal Fatigue.
Strange, huh?
Some say his compositions are 'boring' and lack groove.
Do sell it as a fool did.
My favorites are UK (Debut album), Gazeuse!
Maybe.
But I sold it after a couple of years.
But I think we should see him playing live to fully appreciate his playing.
Some years ago, I found it at a record shop and bought it (the first time was easy).

But if you are looking for anything else, do yourself a favor and keep looking.
There is plenty of nudity, but none of the actors (or actresses) are very attractive so the nudity is also just tedious.
And they got it.
This film is disgusting.
But the songs are really bad and it is very tedious listening to them.
I have seen some other Troma films, so I was not expecting great art.
But I was beaten when the hero burst into song while mopping it up.
The producers wanted a movie that is as gross as possible.
Excrement is what I got.
But I wasn't expecting excrement either.
Look no further.
Looking for a really gross flick?
I was able to sit through the scene where the naked 500 pound man has a supernaturally intense bout of projectile diarrhea.
This is only the second time that I have rated a film one star.
I doubt that I will ever watch the rest of this garbage.Yes folks, this is a musical.

lol.
That is the ONLY downfall about this lotion.
I am very happy I did choose this color.
The color isn't orange in any way.
I loved the color and it washed off my hands.
I also love that you only have to wait an hour to wash it off.
I now just use some standard latex gloves to apply it.
I would recommend that you purchase some gloves.
I am fair complected, so I was a little scared to purchase the "Ultra Dark" tint.
I always wait overnight just to make sure.
I was pleased with how fast this shipped to me.
:) Like I said, I hate the smell after 3 or 4 hours and that's the only thing I hated.
It looks brown and completely natural.
The first time I used it, I just put it on my legs to test it out.
It made my palms brown.
It only took 3 days and it was "standard" 5 day shipping.The lotion itself I'm giving a 4 just because the smell is awful after 3 or 4 hours.
It came off after a couple of hours though.
The 2nd time I used it, I used the lotion all over my body.

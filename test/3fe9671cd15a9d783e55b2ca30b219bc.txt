That's why I love Blizzard games, they delay their release schedules on their new games just to make it sure it's ready for the release.
This program is full of bug.
I can't figure out what's causing it and it is very very frustrating.
So, buyers!
It's a shame because I was about to be hooked on this game.
My system is very stable.
I am running on Windows XP Home edition with 3 full patches installed.
I can't believe they released beta version.
However, the game keeps crashing from every 5 minutes to 2 hours.
I downloaded their latest driver and even tried run windows 98 compatible mode as they suggested, now the program won't even start.
be aware.
This game is actually a lot of fun.
This game is the only game so far wouldn't run.From Southern Califonia gamer...
I finally removed it from my system.
FYI, I have Intel motherboard with Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz with 128MB of Rambus RAM; 40 GB EIDE hard drive and ATI RADEON All in Wonder.

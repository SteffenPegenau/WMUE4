Mostly because of the keyboard and my big hands.
This does not pose a problem AT ALL with this laptop.
Turns out that the processor on the laptop is better than what I had with the desktop.
Better "Windows Experience Index" than the desktop.
Thanks Toshiba!
Love the camera, fingerprint reader.
If you don't listen to music, then these are just fine.
I bought this computer to replace the eMachines desktop that I had.
Overall, great computer.
They are very tinny and not a very good sound quality.
I had only bought the eMachines desktop last October, so only had it for a short time.
I just plugged in my speakers from the desktop into the front headphones jack and that worked just fine.
The only thing downfall for this laptop are the built-in speakers.
Thought that I just wanted to clean up my desk by swapping a huge box for a portable laptop.
Finally, I want mention, that I swore I would NEVER own a laptop.
With 2GB RAM and Intel centrino duo processor, great speed.

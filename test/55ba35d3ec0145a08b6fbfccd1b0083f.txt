Red Moon over Altdorf (solving murder mystery by visiting somebody in the asylum).
The investigation of the sage-detective and his halfling sidekick often leads to fierce hand-to-hand combat rather than mystery-solving routines.
Notwithstanding the problem of originality, the last tale offers an interesting mix of Warhammer battle, siege, and an explanation of the spread of Chaos (fans of the Mordheim game will find some familiar ideas here).
Buried secrets (chasing after artefacts from mummy tomb).
All are well-known themes in the movie industry.
3.
Horror at Alt Krantzstein (poisoning in corrupt monastery).
There are 4 cases covered in the book.
The Zavant Konniger cases are more like fighting adventures than detective stories.
1.
Politics of Shadow (hunting vampire).
2.
4.
Apparently, the tales are heavily influenced by popular cinema culture.
On the whole, I think Execution Hour by the same author is a better treat.

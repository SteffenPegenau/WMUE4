The shipping price was 20% of the purchase price.
It took three weeks to ship this product.
It took an additional week to ship once I inquired.
When I sent the e-mail, it had been two weeks since the order.
There was no explanation as to why it had not shipped.
I was very disapointed in the shipping time for this product.
I will not reorder again from this company.
The amount paid for shipping was not worth the 3 week wait.
I have been using this product for about 6 weeks.
I think we may have been forgotten.
I would consider ordering or buying from a different company however.
When I inquired about the product, I received an e-mail that the order would ship that day.
In addition, it came regular mail.
I have not seen much of a change if any.
This item indicated that it was "in Stock" when ordered.

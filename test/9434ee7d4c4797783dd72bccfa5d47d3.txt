There are just too many faults here.
It's wonderful.I have to tell you the simple truth, though.
Brazil was much too long for me, and in some places I was just saying "This is stupid".
It's interesting how the Amazon reviewers fall into two very opposite camps, those who found this movie boring and those who give it five stars.I like "arty" films.
Try "The Lady Eve".
Try "Discreet Charm of the Bourgeouisie".
I have to agree with the naysayers on this one.It's not enough to be imaginative and different.
Check them out.
All three are far superior to Brazil.
It's not enough to satirize our bureaucratic society.
It disappointed me.Let me steer you to a far superior comedy that is also highly respected by arty people.
Take a look at Aguirre The Wrath of God.
It kills this one.
The film is all over the place, and not that funny.
Try "Closely Watched Trains".
Try "Amelie".

It blew the dirt, etc.
I was wrong.
Duh!
I had high hopes for this product.
I gave it two stars because the idea of using one machine to vacuum and mop is a good concept but this product needs some fine tuning.
I also had problems with water squirting out of the dirty water tank while I was dry vacuuming.
The wet side works for a while, then before I can get all my vinyl flooring done, the suction stops working.
This product was a waste of money.
The filter is going to get wet!
around instead of sucking it up.
I read on the bissell website that this could be due to the fact that the filter is wet.
I will go back to my mop until I find something that works better.
This machine does not dry vacuum well.
I could vacuum and mop with heated water with one machine.
I purchased this product because I thought it would be better than using a mop on my vinyl flooring.

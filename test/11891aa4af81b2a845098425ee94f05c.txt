Didnt work.
I can't tell if it's a a 5th grade girl, or if it's him!
I've heard some stuff about Yanni (mostly from old ladies and such..) that he is a very talented musician.
It is no where near the relaxing music I was hoping for.
Since that album kept me up I took my car and ran it over the following week.
So I got the album and at night I played it.
Hmmm...
I bought this album because, even though I'm more a metal fan I do like music that will relax me.
I advise you not to buy this alubm.
My god!
His vocals are so weird..
Terrible sounding instrumentals and odd annoying vocals make this album "the SUCKsess" it is today.
Seems like the only point of life is to set yourself as a warning for others...
I couldn't sleep.
The only reason I didn't run it over sooner is because I tried let it sinking in.

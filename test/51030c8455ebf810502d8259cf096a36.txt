I track 10+ online accounts (checking, savings, brokerage, IRAs, credit cards).
The upgrade was easy and seemless.
So, I upgraded to Quicken 2005.
No loss of data or functionality, at least for me.
They all downloaded just fine after the upgrade.
This version just like all the other versions works just fine.
I stopped upgrading with Quicken 2002 because that version had all the features I wanted.
Thank you Intuit, keep up the great product!
I consider myself an advanced user since I try and use almost all their (free) features and options.
But starting this year (January 2005), I kept getting warnings about no support for 2002.
The process went very smoothly.
I do like 2005's budget feature much better.
Also, Quicken Basic 2005 seems to be geared more towards the home user instead of the business user.
I have used Quicken Basic for over ten years, upgrading every year.
I like 2005 better than 2002 although 2002 was adequate for my needs.

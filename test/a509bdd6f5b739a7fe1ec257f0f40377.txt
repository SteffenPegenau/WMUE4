My children are 12 and 7.
It does not work without using the inflatable boogie board.
No, this is obviously NOT the big Banzai slide--at one tenth of the price I would not expect it to be.
Don't bother to try.
I see a lot of complaints about tipping over the side.
It is what it is--an inexpensive way to cool off in the summer.
My children really enjoy it.
Turn the water down and voila--it sprays on the slide and runs into the pool.
It is in our opinion just another Slip N' Slide type of water toy to add to our stash for the summer.
We always fill the pool part first also.My kids are having a blast with this.
Once the kids figure out how to get lined up just right though, there is much less tipping over.
I bought this slide locally for $[...] about 2 weeks ago.
For us, it was worth the $[...].
The sprinkler part does not spray onto the slide if your water is turned all the way up.
Yes, that happens occasionally.

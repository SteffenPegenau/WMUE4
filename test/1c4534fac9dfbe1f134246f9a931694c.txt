Where I live is humid and the curl would disappear within the first 30 minutes after using these other methods.
If you want curls in your hair, then I highly recommend you buy this product.
When I wake up the next morning, my hair still has some of the curl left.
My daughter bought the Caruso steam curlers as a Christmas gift.
It was the best gift I receieved.
You will not be sorry.
I've used regular sponge curlers, hot curlers, and a curling iron.
Every time I use it my curls stay in all day long and into the night.
It takes up very little space on my counter.
I don't know how this works.....but it works.
This machine is amazing!
I'm happy and my husband is happy.
My hair is straight and nothing I did would keep the curl in for very long.
I love these curlers and the machine!
He loves me with curly hair.

Only after his death have I realized how scarred he was by that experience).
I wasn't over there.
10 years ago he would tell these stories like jokes and laugh like crazy.
I can see now that he has been living in hell for 30+ years.
I think about 50,000 or so just got killed.
I've read a couple of reviews that downgraded this film as being unrealistic.
This crap did happen though.
Nowadays he can't talk about Vietnam without breaking down and sobbing and crying.
I would think "That is one hardcore SOB!"
Duh, it's a movie.
Of, course only the most sensational aspects of the war are portrayed.
I do have numerous friends who were.
Maybe this film is unrealistic in the fact that this wasn't the average soldier's experience.
Many will not really talk about it (just like my dad who served 4 years in WWII and saw heavy action.
The war mercifully ended weeks before I would have been.
I know a guy who used to tell me horror stories similar to those portrayed in this movie.

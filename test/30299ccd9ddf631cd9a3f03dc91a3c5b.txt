Maybe they wanted nothing to do with this garbage.
They are Hollywood actors for crying out loud!
The fighters looked like something out of WW2.
In a sci fi movie?
Play the game (even though it's old, it's still classic), but leave the movie out of your home.
Something about Space Pilgrims, and beating the Kilrathi (who look like rejects from the Broadway show CATS).The acting was terrible.
Makes sense.One more thing.
I don't even remember what it was about, that's how bad it was.
That's never good.
The plot is garbage.
Why did they not use Mark Hammil and that guy from Back to the Future?
Utter garbage.
The worst was Boys and Girls, another steaming pile of *bleep* starring Freddy Prince Jr.
They were awsome actors in the videogames, why not use them?
The only reason why I put this one ahead is because some of the space battle scenes are somewhat interesting to look at.Ok where do I start?

If you need a manged switch, this might be more important to you than I
This unit runs very warm so make sure you place it away from other heat sources.
I did not check if WPA Radius worked.
It checked out ok, so I reinstalled the firmware.
Some resets later, it worked, but not with WEP or WPA.
I checked the firmware version to make sure I had installed the correct firmware.
My AP is using WPA2.
Maybe it was just a glitch.
WPA AES is not supported.
Before I purchased this product, I was aware of the problems with WPA and the latest firmware that corrected the issues.
Two resets later, it worked with WEP and WPA TKIP.
A small fan may not be a bad idea for any electronic device.
As long as the ports function, I am happy.
I have an Xbox and two computers connected without any problems.I have not tested the switch, as far as features and speed is concerned.
Still, after installing the latest firmware, I had IP conflicts.
I cannot recreate the problem I experienced.

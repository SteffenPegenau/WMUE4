The biggest bonus is a rosabel mix of Vicki Sue Robinson, clocking in at a lengthy 7:53.
The Relief (4:56)9.
Feeling it Too (6:54)10.
Energy Factor 9 (6:11)5.
Move On (7:53)7.
The Power (7:25)6.
Don't you Want My Love (7:39)8.
Women Beat Their Men (2:44)4.
In & Out of My Life (4:24)11.
Control (7:46)2.
Considering this is an Abel mix, there's a heavy emphasis on mixes and tracks by the Rosabel team, which isn't a bad thing, because they release some of the hottest vocal and tribal tracks around.
Rejoice by Michelle Weeks shouldn't have been on the playlist, considering it was included on Circuit Sessions 1 in a much better mix than this repetitive dub.
Rejoice (4:13)3.
Lifetime to Love (6:49)
Even so, this disc keeps that party feel, and is a good second installment of the series.1.

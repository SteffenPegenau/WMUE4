She writes great songs about her lifestyle and she makes me feel.
Frankly, the more I listen to her music, the more I like her.
Eventhough, she acts like a skank from hell, her music is pretty darn good.A few years back someone made me listen to Live Through This and I loved the damm thing.
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR AN EXORCIST!!!!!
Stevie Nicks can rock but rarely every does.
I got to hand it for Love.
!
When I heard she was coming out with another album I ran out and bought it (I hope I'm not supporting her drug habit.).
AND I LIKE IT, especially the first four songs.
Well basically Female Rockers like Sheryl Crow, Chryssie Hyndes only have one speed - they're really not about rock music, but about hits and they rarely make me feel.
Then I bought Celebrity Skin and really liked that one too.
I love Mono and Hold Onto Me especially.Why do I like her music?
She is too safe.
Courtney ROCKS and I love the lyrics.
UGGGGGG!!!!!

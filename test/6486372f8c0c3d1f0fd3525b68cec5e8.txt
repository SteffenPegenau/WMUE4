Finally watched it on YouTube and it was just okay.
There was a total and complete lack of character development.
It's never explained.
Rape fantasies?
Really?
I'm sorry to not jump on the "Curtains" bandwagon.
And two visits to the casting couch; one with a guy they never even identified.
All of the actresses were interchangeable.
More like a farmhouse, in my opinion.
The ice skating scene was cool and the killer was appropriately creepy, but what was with the creepy dolls?
And the mansion?
Honestly, the ending felt like they ran out of film, mostly because of an endless and boring chase scene.
I do believe it deserves its due in a restored version with the original artwork intact.
And though it's usually par for the course, I found this film disturbingly misogynistic.
Maybe I will give it another look then.

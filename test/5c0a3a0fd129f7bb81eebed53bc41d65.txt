It's a tiny book.
It's not that it's well written or even very original.
It's an over-rated very short story whose fame precedes it.
It is, however, allegorical.
I first recall reading it in the seventies and it made very little impact on me.
You won't be wasting much of your life.
He has learnt much from his heavenly father and is keen to pass the knowledge on to others.
In fact, more than anything, it's just banal.
In simple terms, JLS is Jesus.
Get real!
However, never let anyone tell you it is a great book or that it changed their life.
He can even perform miracles.Although this book has been widely praised and sold millions of copies, I had real difficulty in seeing why.
So, some almost forty years later I decided to make a second attempt.It only takes an hour or so to read "Jonathan Livingston Seagull".
What on earth is all the fuss about?By all means, go ahead and read this book.
It's not even a very long short story.
What a peculiar little book.

It says in the Bible to not have sex before marrige.
All the reviewers who said "Forever" was a great book are wrong.
Sex is special.
I'm not immature or old fashioned.
Judy Blume should be ashamed of herself.
Sure, go ahead, have it before marrige but in the end all you gain is bad memories and regret.
Are you trying to make millions of girls end up like Kathy?
Maybe some people would say I'm making too big of a deal of this, but there are thousands of girls affected by this book.
Not every girl in the world can afford to be like Kathy.
Kathy can like Theo and maybe even marry him, but she'll still have that memory of her time with Micheal.
Many of girls are making Kathy their role model.
I am sure many parents do not want a book teaching their girl how to have sex.
First, I want to say that I read most of the reviews.
I know Kathy is a fictional character, but there are a lot of Kathys in the world.
Judy?
It is something that should be saved for marrige.

If you like strong women in your book this isn't the one for you.
You might actually like it, but I didn't.
That would have made it all the greater.
It drives me crazy.
I don't know.
The other thing I had issue with is how the main female and main male characters fell in love so quickly.
It would have at least been nice to see them slowly fall in love.
SIGH.
I found myself giving up almost towards the end.
Go head, read the book.
Throughout most of the book she needs someone to take care of her.
Yes the main female character has lost her sister and had her nephew kidnapped but come on.
I really wanted to love this book but I just couldn't.
I just started to lose interest.
I can tell that I'm in the minority here.
I know some people believe in love at first sight but come on.

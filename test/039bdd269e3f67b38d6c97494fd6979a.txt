WHAT A PIECE of crap oyster is making.I thought after 25 years they would have made them better!
So today I went garage saleing and found a vintage OYSTER blender for $2.00.
!Oster is junk.........I have owned a vintage Oyster 10 Speed from the 1970s.
NOT!!!!!!!!.
Since then I have had 4 OYSTER blends.
I tried 2 14 speeds- 2 12 speeds.
I had used at least 4 times a week for 25 some years.
Im sure it will last longer that any new one I bought.
You better go back to making them the way YOU USE to-because I will not keep buying.
Works great.
No more products I will buy from you.
Each one of them the motors smoked and quit.
I make a smoothie just about every morning with bananas, a few frozen strawberries and yogurt.
What a great blender it was.
It can not handle that.
I will be looking for more antiquers for backups.DEAR OYSTER COMANY: You have just lost a customer.
Don't waste your money!!!
It had finally died 4 months ago.

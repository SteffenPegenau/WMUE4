I laughed when I realized he was desperate enough to join the cast of Moesha.
{They're all the same 2 me} Waitaminute, Usher can juke.
Sing, dance, take my shirt off, call it a day} Me being a guy, I'd say he's just as good {but no better} than any other sex symboled artist.
3 stars.
Don't wanna call him copy, but thats whats he's goin for.
I laughed bout him and Kim.
His album is like a mix between Marquis' {Naked} and Usher's {8701} album.
Ray J has FINALLY managed to blend in.
I'd do the same thing.
Thats great.
{Hell I don't blame em.
His video was playin and I wasn't payin attention.
Cause I {along with the rest o the world} took him seriously this time.
.... Back to the drawing board Ray J
I laughed at his last album.
Anytime Ray J can show his face without me laughing is great.
It sounded aight, but didn't hold my attention.
{Ah, good times those were} Ray J musta wished apon a shining star tho.
Thats what it is.

We're halfway through the Tribulation and at 44 years-old, I am wondering if I will live long enough to see this series end.
Another bomb like The Mark and all future Left Behind installments will be left behind from my reading list.One star for marketing.
I honesty have never read worse.But, yes.
Skip this one and find something better to do with a rainy afternoon.
If the remainder of the books drag like this one did, there are probably 20 or 30 more to come.
Elementary school-level writing, cardboard characters and oh-so-painfully-bad dialog didn't deter me.
At one every nine or so months .
.
Just 300+ pages of filler (mostly dialog) that left me irritated and feeling ripped-off at the end.
I read all the others.
.
Somehow, the story kept things moving along and I became addicted.
The Mark, however, has no story.
I promise you won't be missing a thing because truly, nothing happens.
well, you do the math.

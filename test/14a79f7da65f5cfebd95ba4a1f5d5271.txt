I did find the volume quite low too.
Battery door looks flimsy but I believe it's quite strong actually.
I do find that it stops every now and then.
Perfect size too.
SanDisk should come up with one for the Companion.
Much lower than the others I've had.
The EQ settings are great.
This is the third mp3 player I've owned and probably the best sounding.
I use that.
Belt clip is useless.
I run every day and I've gotten about 7 hours on one battery.
Battery life is pretty good.
It just doesn't like certain songs I guess :-) Only seen this a couple times though.
Luckily the last player I had came with an arm strap.
I've had the Companion for about a month now.

How did he get here?
Think about this one....
Even the out takes weren't funny!
Let's get one thng clear the plot is so thin that it only two plages long.
The big song and dance number is totally not needed.
You know who the bad guy is the second time you see him.
After the fight, Tucker and Jackie are confront by the head bad guy that they had over powered in the office.
The heros finally figure out who the bad guy is and over power him in his office.
Who cares?
The big fight happens, which is copy of Rush Hour1 and Shanghi Knights.
Now the very next scene Jackie shows up at the killer's place with a girl, but the girl is Tucker in a wig.
The scene in th dojo with the BIG guy is totally not needed.
Who knows?
Why didn't someone take a picture of the girl's head and give it to the cops?
Whay wasn't he locked up?
The second bad guy, the brother, calls and tells Jackie he has the girl and will trade the letter for her.

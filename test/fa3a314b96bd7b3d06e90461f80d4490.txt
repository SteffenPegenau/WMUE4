Muted high and lack of clarity2.
I have to retry it a few times to make it turn on.
Looks good enough for the priceCons:1.
Not sure yet if I'm going return this one.In summary:Pros:1.
Comfortable3.
Good price2.
Noise cancellation doesn't work as well as Bose QC2/QC33.
In terms of look and comfort I have no complaints considering the attractive price.
Music feels muted and lack of clarity.The unit I received may also be defective.
At the same time the sound quality is also quite far from satisfactory.
However, the noise cancellation function doesn't work as well as Bose QC2 or QC3.
In my particular case, on/off switch may be defective
It turns out to be somewhat a disappointment.
Given the raving reviews on this product, I was expecting something impressive.
Can be used with noise cancellation turned off4.
Sometimes when I turn on the noise cancellation the blue LED doesn't come on and noise cancellation doesn't kick in.

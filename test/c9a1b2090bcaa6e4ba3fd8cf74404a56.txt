No more Intel for me.
This is my first AMD machine, and I am sold.
It's not a high end laptop, but it's nice.
Anyhow back to HP.
I bought the computer for $850 from a retailer new, so shop around.
They are the Bose of the computer world.
I did a benchmark test side by side against my Dell Inspiron 2650.
The Dell having a 1.8Ghz P4.
Based on ignorant people stating the 797Mhz processor speed as a fault there is proof that there are still a lot of people that have no business owning a computer.
Over inflated prices for the performance.
The worst feature is the video card is weak, and the mouse is sluggish every now and then.
One might ask..if you had a P4 Dell why did you get a new laptop?
The screen is probably the best feature.
Another thing is the AMD runs way cooler than the P4m.
The HP out-performed the Dell on every level.
Tons of Marketing (it's a dell DUDE) and very bad product.
I love the styling of the computer.
Easy Dell Sucks BAD!!
The HP ZV5320US is a decent computer.

The impression is the editors don't have a firm grip on vocabulary matters.
That's the main point.
A few words are not listed in any of the book's dictionaries.
Converters are available, but the resulting audio quality is bearable, not more.
Try to find 'job', for instance.
]* The vocabulary is too limited to university student life.
Many words appear once and never again.
*[Later addition] Now the publisher lets you download mp3 files.
Right from book 1 there is no romanization, a big bonus.
Romanization keeps you from ever learning Hangul.
This is really great news!
[Audio files should have been provided in mp3 format.
It's not there, only 'arbeit', something you do while studying.
It takes forever, but the difference in sound quality is dramatic.
What you learn in this book is no-nonsense useful stuff.

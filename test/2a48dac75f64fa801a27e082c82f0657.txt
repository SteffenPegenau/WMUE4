The songs are very tasteful - very romantic.
Is Joe Sample's playing akin to noodling?
Does any of this matter?
Yes.
Plus, and what Amazon misses, is that Lalah Hathaway is the daughter of the great Donny Hathaway, whose brilliant career ended prematurely when he committed suicide in 1979.
No.
NO!
This is a typical example of not listening to the critics.
Yes.
Is it somewhat formulatic?
She may not be the talent he was, but you have to give her a little break just because of who she is.
Does this CD break any new ground?
So......light the fire, break open a bottle of wine for you and your partner, and play this CD.
This is a great CD.
You will enjoy it.

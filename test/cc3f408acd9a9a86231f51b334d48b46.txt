The return was easy.
The second time the technical person had me do a firmware update.
This did not help.
Stop.
I thought it was the modem but in fact it was the wireless box.
Music would play for a few minutes.
This product did not stream live internet radio music properly.
And after, I bought a Cisco Linksys Wireless router product instead from Amazon.
And, keep repeating the same song over and over again.
It would start again.
So, I gave up and sent the product back to Amazon.
I guess sometimes it is better to spend a little more and get a better product and better customer service too.
I called Belkin two times.
They even paid for the return shipping.
Now, I can listen to live internet radio again.
And, actually my web pages load faster with the Cisco Linksys router instead of the Belkin router.

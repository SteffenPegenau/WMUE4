Unlike him... Zzzzzzzzzzz....No, that's not just the 1st chapter, I was 2/3 through when I just gave up on it.Don't waste your money.
Perhaps you should hire a professional, someone who is customer focussed enough?
Really, you're really not customer focussed enough.
Tell him you're not customer focussed enough.
If you want to know how great he is, send him an email.
No, you're not.
He constantly informs you, dear reader, that you're just not customer focussed enough.
Do you get it yet?
Not at all.
You're not customer focussed enough.
Because you, why you're just not customer focussed enough.
You should be more like him, because he IS customer focussed, see?
Unlike him.
Right at the start he states that he will use the book to push his own services.He's not kidding.I feel almost guilty reviewing a book I didn't finish reading - but that I just couldn't finish a book by a pro' copywriter speaks for itself.
Not at all.

That is all very nice.
It was bundled as a free item with the purchase of my HP laptop.
It is hard to beat.
As for daily use, I don't use it.
I use my laptop backback.
The quality of the bag is good.
The shoulder strap could be a little wider for such a large bag.
This is a nice shoulder bag designed for laptops up to 17".
I wish it were the 15" bag of this same production line.
The problem is the laptop that I got this with is a 14" widescreen and it just gets swallowed.
Anyone looking for a good quality LARGE bag will enjoy the laptop carry all.
There are lots of cool inner pockets for every function imaginable.
That would make more sense.
I think that they were matched up because the color schemes matched.
Plus I felt compeled to use all the space in the bag which makes it quite heavy.

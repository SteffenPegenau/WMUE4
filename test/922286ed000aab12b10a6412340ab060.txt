I rarely write reviews but I had to warn you!
The fight scenes were wack.
Lateef Crowder was a good Eddy Gordo.
If you do watch it, then there is something after the end credits.
I hope this is redone right!
This was definitely a 99 cents rental.
I leave you with a fitting line from the movie: "Defeat is a choice, so is victory."
This movie was so low budget, they couldn't afford Donnie Yen to play Marshall Law.
I should have went to sleep and saved my $3.99 for a MP3 Album Deal of the Day.
Jon Foo made a decent Jin but he's not even Japanese.
It also makes me think of the Dragonball: Evolution fail.
The people behind this movie obvious went with the former.
I liked DOA and was hoping it would be similar to that movie.
Unfortunately, it was as bad as Street Fighter.
I only gave it 2 stars because at least Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa visually made a good Heihachi Mishima.

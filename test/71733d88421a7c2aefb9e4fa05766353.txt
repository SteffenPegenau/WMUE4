I could be seen throwing it down more then picking it up.
Then the third ... well, here it is ... usually I read brooks in a couple of days.
Most of his series are stories within a story.
I loved his other works.
I've read all of his work to date and am a huge fan.
Non-stop ... can't rip it out of my hands if you tried.
I didn't connect with any of the characters and found it completely predictable.
The second picked up some speed and I thought the story had been salvaged.
reminds us no one is perfect and we're all human.
This was one however was a continuous long droning story.
Very disappointed!
This is truley the first time I was disappointed with one of his series.
Hopefully it gets better ...
With this book, I had to force myself to read it and stay focused.
I guess everyone is entitled to a bad one every once in a while.
The first book was disappointing.

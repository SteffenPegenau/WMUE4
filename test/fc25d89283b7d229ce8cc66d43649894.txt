Just rinse under the faucet.
I was orignally reluctant to buy the Baby Bjorn because I thought it would be too small, and I thought it was a bit pricey.
and is very comfortable for my son.
If I was designing the perfect bib, this would be it.
And it turns out the size was not an issue at all.
The Soft Bib is the very best bib that we have found.
The plastic is very soft and flexible.
It catches EVERYTHING!
We went through alot of bibs (and $) before we found the Soft Bib.
When I finally got the soft bib I was so impressed.
And it is a snap to clean.
I therefore bought a cheaper brand of the formed bib, but it's hard plastic edge dug into my son's neck and left red marks.
Baby Bjorn did it again.
Well worth the money.It is so well designed and durable.
My son is large for his age (97th percentile), but this bib still fits him just fine at age 2 1/2.

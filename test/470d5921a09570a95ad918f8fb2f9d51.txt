And so well constructed!
It took me from removing from the box to finish about an hour.
She slept in it the first night.
I bought this cage for my Quaker parrot.
Inside everything was bubble wrapped and banded together, it was in perfect condition.
My Quaker took right to it, climbing and inspecting it as I was putting it together.
There is room for birds up to an African grey size.
I was a little worried because I had read that it was difficult to put together and the instructions were bad.
Arrived in one day, packaging was excellent, the corners were all reinforced on the box and it was all banded.
The cage itself is beautiful!
I have no negatives to say about it.
My little quaker has tons of room!
It is fantastic!
I had no problem at all, did it completely alone and the instructions were fine.
Don't be shy about purchasing this cage, you will love it.

It keeps you hooked from page one.
I swear I was there riding in the car.
You'll laugh out loud and maybe even cry a little bit.
Remember the "fresh girls"?
Terribly stimulating and funny.
You will!
!I recommend this book and look forward to reading more of Susan M. Brooks.
What a great book.
Parts of the book brought back memories of schoolhood that I had forgotten about.
She has an easy flowing style, not like many I've read in a long time.
292 pages and I was done in 3 days.
I didn't want to put it down.
Susan M. Brooks can write.
Working days!
She keeps you captivated.
You want to know what's going to happen next.

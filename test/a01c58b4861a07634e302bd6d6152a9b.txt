From what I've heard Metroid Prime 2 is 4 player co-op and online compatible.
So if you want a challenging game and can't find one this is a great choice.
People are always complaining about the controls but that's just because they stink.
If somebody has a problem with a game why get it?
I understand why this was 2002 game of the year.
The first time I saw this game I thought it would be boring but after I played it at wal-mart I thought it looked cool.
The music and sound is great.
I can't understand why people complain about that.
I don't care if you don't like FPS games because this is more it's also an RPG.
Which is good.
Metroid Prime is a great game and if your a Cube owner get this.
It's really fun.
But after a while I started to like it alot so I got it for thirty dollars.
I really like the lock on feature.
I started researching it and I found lots of information, good and bad.
I had no problem with the controls.

The help (both in the help menu and online) is not very helpful.
I have never actually exited out of the program because it always crashes on it's own.
No user manual was included.
It can't even meet my basis needs.
this product, however, is horrible.
I get eror messages constantly and it crashes every time I use it.
It was just a very bad product.
I could go on for even longer about it but I won't.
Check out their online help site and you will see an abundance of negative feedback (I didn't see this until after I purchased the product and was going there to get help).
I don't know what else is out there, but there has to be something better than this.

This is no exageration.
It doesn't work well with XP (which is never really mentioned anywhere).
I bought this because it was inexpensive and I don't need much for my purposes of video editing.
Even if it costs a little more it would be worth it!

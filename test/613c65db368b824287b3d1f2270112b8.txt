Sets are minimal, but perfect and varied.
The lighting puts it all together and varies the pallet when needed.The acting is good not great.
However, his work for Ophelia and Gertrude is remarkable.
She thinks she is the only one onstage.
There is much good to say about this production.
As far as I'm concerned, when she was onstage, no one could top her.
He does not know how to write for men.
The Gertrude was magnificent, as was the Ghost of Hamlet's Father.
I've read nothing but raves for Natalie Dessay, but I find her a bit too mousy with a self-obsessed delivery.
But this is Hamlet's play and opera.
I love the play "Hamlet" and I love opera.
The costumes are brilliantly conceived.
Keenlyside is one note as are his arias.
Visually it is stunning and original.
I do think they have overlooked Gertrude though.
Claudius was a little to commonplace for me--certainly not the monster he should be.Thomas' opera is uneven.
No wonder all the reviewers are so ga-ga over Dessay.

The cd is sad, and that song is.. Something else.
Even the instrumentals are great.
PERFECT is all i can say.
Once i got past the Aria lump, which took awhile, i heard the rest of the cd.
This CD made me want to curl into a ball and die.
The best song on here (in my opinion of course) is Innocente.
But if i were to hear Delerium for the first time, i'd be so turned off by that song.
Not that it's bad, by no means is it..
If you're not into ambient that much, this will help you on your way.
Then Terra Firma started getting stuck in my head.
For first time listeners of Delerium, start here.
That was the first hook from this CD that got me.
I don't see how that one fit here.
I'm a big fan of harder music, like taproot and factory 81, and this cd refuses to come out of my cd player.
High points include Fallen Ikons, and especially Underwater.
It's perfect-- Except Aria.
Great CD, get it NOW while they still have the limited edition in print..

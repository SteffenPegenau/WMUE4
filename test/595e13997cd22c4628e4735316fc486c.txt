Can't recommend this iron.

It is hard to store because you can't wrap the cord around the handle to store it.

Con(s): Does not iron well.
Just using the dial does not reset the power.
Ugh!!
It is hard to direct the spray.

Very disappointed with this iron.
The power goes off (supposed to be a safety feature) and then you have to actually unplug it to reset it.

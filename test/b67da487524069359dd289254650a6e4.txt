OK, now onto why it gets a star off.
Unlike some other pomade and hairstyling products which tend to give me a headache due to their strong and offensive smell.
It has this minimalistic feel too it.
Seriously, I have to refrain myself from tasting it.
It smells like cream.
Although it does provide good medium hold and the wet, shiny look, it doesn't last long.
After about 2 hour or so, it just dissipates.
Or maybe I just need to use more than little daps.
Clean and stylish.
It provides good shine, nice texture and medium hold.
It goes away on its own.
This pomade's scent is very light and pleasant.
I like the container's design, too.
Other than that, it is a very good product for its price.
But it could be an upside, I mean you don't even have to wash it off.

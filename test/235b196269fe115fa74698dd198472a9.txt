In LH's case, I think it underestimated us AND went over our heads.
I can see people comparing it to "art".
Look at Dark City, Devil's Advocate, City of Lost Children, Closetland, The Matrix, etc.
Perhaps the goal of the movie was to get us thinking about the meaning of which there is none?
Why is it, for something to be truly artsy it has to have a red balloon that pops causing the sun to eclipse or a man dying and becoming someone else?
I've seen plenty of reality shattering movies that don't take it to the extreme Lynch did.
Sad really.
But, c'mon, people, why can't anyone fess up to the fact that Lynch is basically just tooling around with all of us?
It's just a notion of mine.
Perhaps there is no real answer?
This movie was okay.
Perhaps he just wanted us to have our own interpretation?
I'm a huge Twin Peaks fan.

These are all movies that didn't go over our head but didn't underestimate us either.
I just don't see what all the fuss is about with this project.

Pros: The book is small and wont take up rome in your back pack.
I may feel differently about a place.
This book was one of 3 we took on our trip last year.
You will hate it, even if your are cheap, like me.
Although the price of a call is not worth it.
Cons: The book has no pictures!
If you dont know, London is expensive.
It was the worst of the 3 and the information was somewhat dated.
I never trust what the writters of the guides print without pictures.
The book is paper back and pages are of cheap paper.If you can only get one book, make this the last option.
It had the best cheap resturants of any of the 3 books.
Cheap London hotels listed in book are dumps and mostly unsafe.
Forget going to Londan at the $90 a day price tag.
It has some address and numbers if you want to call a place.
Cheers!

you make chicken breast on there?
I very much like this grill.
I don't use it for steaks anymore but for chicken it does WONDERS.
You have to use a meat thermometer to ensure you don't overcook.
but quite frankly there isn't any better.
the top especially is very difficult to clean.
Inevitably ending up on the shelf where you store it.
Turns out wayyyy better.Biggest downside, and I mean HUGE downside is the cleaning.
?
The white plastic feet also fall out of the bottom repeatedly.. and after awhile you just lose them?
People scoff saying.. ugh.
yuck.
You end up with charred crumbs falling inbetween hinges, and onto the counter.
Easily 10+min to clean it after each use.
I tend to make whatever pasta or curry or whatever on the stove but will make the chicken in here.
But with that slight bit of effort this makes the moistest chicken breast I've ever had.

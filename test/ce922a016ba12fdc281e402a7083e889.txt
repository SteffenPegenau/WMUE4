But, I gave in and read it.
If you have read the rest of the series, and plan to continue reading, read this book.
Somehow Goodkind continues to combine unlikely coincidences with a frighteningly realistic plot and characters to match.
So, my recomendation?
Do NOT read this book if you have not read the rest of the series.
"Why does Goodkind think I'd want to read about anyone other than Richard and Kahlan???"
Jennsen, Sebastion, Tom and - yes, even the goat, Betty all touch your heart.
As with all the rest of Goodkind's characters, you grow to love some new ones.
When I discovered who the book was going to be revolved around, I nearly had a fit!
It's worth it.
It will ruin the book and the series for you.
Not his best, though.
And, to my suprise, it was good.
If you're looking for finer examples of Goodkind's writings, read earlier books in the Sword Of Truth series, they are much better.
However, this book is a must if you're a Sword Of Truth fan.

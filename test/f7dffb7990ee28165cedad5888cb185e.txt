This game has No replay value.
(...)
Nope.
I completed that Pokemon Ruby 8 times with no enjoyment.
and not to mention its so easy it makes me sick.
I played it again and again expecting somthing more.
Please all reviewers read this review with an open mind.
Not a drop.
Thank you.
The only reson I played it so many times is because that was my only game.
When nintindo made this game it must have been for babies!
Oh, and guess what.
This game has not a drop of replay value.
To this day I dread that moment I placed in my order for this game.
THIS GAME IS THE MOST BORING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE.

Drynwyn is the most powerful weapon in Prydain.
It was a little violent and the names are confusing.
This book is confusing unless you read the other books in the series.
That is why I rated it like I did.
This book is a little like The Hobbit, by J.R.R Tolkien.
This wasn't one of his best written books.
I like The Hobbit a lot better.
Now Taran, an assistant pig keeper during the medieval age must travel to Mount Dragon evil's strong hold.
During a winter of danger Taran reaches Mount Dragon.
Like the name Eilonwy is a diffucult name to say.
The Hobbit was easier to follow and was very well written.
I sugjest that you read the other books first.
They just jump right into the story where it left off from the other book.
(The Prydain Chronicles) They don't descibe the setting of characters in the book.
He faces Arawn evil deathlord, and makes the most crucial desicion of his life.This book wasn't a very good novel.

If you didn't read some.
I also saw the movie Paddle in class.
We did fun projects with Paddle-to-the-Sea.
We did.
I didn't think this book kept my intrest that much.
If you've read Paddle or any other Holling C. Holling books, good.
And try to read Paddle.
Bye!
Maybe order it from amazon.
That was my favorite project with Paddle.
The book was much better.
Sometimes while reading this book I felt as if I would fall asleep.
It stunk!
I read Paddle-to-the-Sea with my 4th grade class.
I didn't like the book as much as I thought I would.
Try reading the book and watching the movie and doing a comparsion.
At home we had to make a board game using Paddle-to-the-Sea.

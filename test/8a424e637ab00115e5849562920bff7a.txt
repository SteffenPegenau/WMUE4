All the way from the up-and-coming Jude Law to the very underrated Ed Harris.
It's about the only movie based on the Eastern Front of WWII.
Second, the image the movie puts in your head of what war is like is second only to Saving Private Ryan.
The movie is something that I find interesting.
This DVD is beautiful.
Now the complaints.
It deals with a true story.
A combination of things.
There are many more reasons to get this DVD.Okay, enough of all these compliments.
First off, the acting is excellent.
But, this one seems to pull it off pretty good.So, if you want a good movie, get this.
It is basically a sniper movie, but it's a war movie at heart.So what makes this movie so good?
I'm not a big fan of love stories in war movies.
About my only complaint is the love story.
The picture, the sound, the clarity.

Now that's a really big mistake in my book.This movie was enjoyable for me.
No realism.
Hardcore MMA fans will be stocked with disappointment.
This movie should have been rated X, under Softcore Porn.Big name MMA fighters head the front of the cover, but the main actor is Hector Echavarria.
And not for any kids under 18.
And if you haven't noticed yet, he's also the Director, Producer, and Writer.
And that I was watching a bad acting softcore porn movie with some underground fight scenes in it.
That's when I started to enjoy the movie.So beware before buying or renting this movie.
But then I cleared my mind, trying to be open minded, thinking that this was only a movie.
Their movements were so slow.
First off, this movie is not for everyone.
It was plan laughable.
Everything was so fake.
Basically, I was saying WTF, after the first few minutes.
Even though the fight scenes were a real disappointment.

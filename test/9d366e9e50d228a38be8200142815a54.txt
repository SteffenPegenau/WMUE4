It is rock and it is more.
This album has intensity and structure that few bands can claim.
What were these guys smoking when they made this cd?
The closest comparison I can make is to The Dirty Three, and, that is a compliment coming from me.
How to describe the music, you ask?
Whatever it was, they've turned out a most unusual debut instrumental powerhouse of a cd!
It gets as far out as many experimental jazz recordings do, but, it is not jazz.
Just a suggestion, lads.
It has enormous intensity and rhythm without losing its way.
It's cerebral and visceral at the same time.
Don't want to interfere with your creative process, now.
They both sound like random jamming, but, there is so much more.
I'm not sure.
I look forward to hearing more things from the lads, and, maybe, just maybe, some vocals thrown into the stew just to see what they could come up with.
Both bands have a sound that is not like others.

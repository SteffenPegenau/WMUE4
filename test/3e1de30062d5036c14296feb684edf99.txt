Justin's voice probably cannot be taken for over 40 minutes.
They let everyone know they used 70's hard rock as their model for that sound.
Sorry guys but you were "This Year's Model" 2 years ago.
Hasbeens.
Some people see this band as a joke while others think The Darkness are the second coming.
This rocks half as hard and that just isn't good enough.
The Cars maybe?
Nothing on here rocks for long besides "One Way Ticket" and "Bald".
The Darkness had an interesting debut album months, no check that, years ago.
The debut had at least 50% memorable songs that were fun.
I fall somewhere close to the middle.
That was not a long CD, neither is this.
I would have thought with this much time on your hands you could have come up with something better.
This CD appears to be using more of 80's new wave as the template here.
Queen, Thin Lizzy prime examples.

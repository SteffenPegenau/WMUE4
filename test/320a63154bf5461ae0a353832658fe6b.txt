Support the underdogs out there.
I saw POS in concert in Phoenix and it was the best performance I have seen in a long long time.
He brings out the old boombox and messes around on the mic.
HAVE FUN AND BUY THIS.
Like the first review said, the man comes out as if he is just a stage manager or something.
POS has created a totally new and diffrent style and you cannot go wrong by buying this CD.
I would give it more if possible.
There is no way you can hear it and not like it NO WAY.
Then all of a sudden as he is talking he begins to rap and the beats kick in.
This CD is just flawless showcasing POS' original style and flow.
This one is a hidden gem.
So I gurantee happy listening.
Ha ha ha, there was absolutely no hesitation giving this the good ol' five star rating.
All tracks are great, but the best ones for me are 1,2,4,10,15.
This CD literally changed my life, thats how powerful the words and songs are.

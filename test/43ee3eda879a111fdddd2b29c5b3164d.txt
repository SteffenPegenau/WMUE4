You prob better off just ordering it online, got mine on nutrition depot.
Mix-ability is decent.
Reasonably priced.
81 grams of carbs!!
This one is the best gainer I have tried.
Also, it's not easy to find.
Has creatine 3.
60 grams of protein 2.
Low on fat 4.
The only complain I have about it is that I should have gotten one with no creatine cause im trying to get off it.

I'm really surprised that no one has reviewed this gainer.

Low on sugar 7.

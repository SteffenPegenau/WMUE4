just a good song, it all works together.
I dunno, maybe get the cd for clocks?
... A beautiful, enchanting piano melody that's almost unmatched, and which sticks in your mind, nice strings and all, nice vocals.
they're slow and boring to me - either slow and boring, or dull and repetitive.
I mean it really is.
...My liking for Clocks reminds me of that, and like Poison, it stands out from the rest of the songs.
okay so maybe not I've overrated it somewhat and all, but oh well....
None of the other songs on this cd have such a cool melody or anything.
but I'm just not getting the other ones that much.
or all of the above.
the song's just awesome.
I got this cd basically just for the song clocks.
that song is one of the best new songs, in my opinion, that I've heard in a while.
even the drumming is good.
I'm not terribly impressed YET - but then I've just gotten the cd, and maybe I need to "discover" it.
... Clocks is awesome.
whatever.

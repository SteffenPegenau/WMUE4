Ink starts banding.
This printer lasted a month.
Colors don't print.
That's where.
Black is a mess.
Yup.
It's amazing that a product like this is even allowed to hit the shelves.
I will never buy another Epson as long as I live.
Smokin' wacky tobbaci out in the parking lot.
This printer is a P.O.S.!
Get it together, Epson!
I tried cleaning the nozzles, buying all new ink, cleaning the nozzles again, running a bunch of high-ink, high-color print jobs.
Same problem here - a handful of good shots over the course of a few weeks, then...*WHAM* Sorry, no more output.
Where's the Q.A.
Department at Epson?
No luck!
My HP lasted for years.

No other words.
This movie stinks.
But am I not here to talk about the DVD?
Don't even know why she showed it to me and nevertheless, I'm not a big fan of Julia Roberts.
Personally, I didn't like this movie, don't know why my, sister wanted the DVD.
Yada yada its a great dvd.
WHY?
I don't care.
In my opinion it sucked.
Its got kirsten dunst.
(her acting sucked in this movie) (i'm not a geek or a comic book freak or a dungeons and dragons or chess player)
The girl from spiderman.
yawn... Theres still one good reason to get this dvd.
Ehh... Not really exciting special features though.
It might be good to someone else.
And any friend of spiderman is a friend of mine.
Cause I love special features.

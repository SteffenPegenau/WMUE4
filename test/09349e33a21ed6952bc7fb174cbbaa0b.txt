I just didn't care.
If you can make it to the end, more power to you...
It never looked particularly interesting to me personally, so I put it off and put it off.
And then...what I expected: the author began to describe the tedious nuances of the slightly-different faiths in excruciating detail.
But, sometimes we're wrong, right?
So, take the advice that makes sense for you.
I have heard for years how good this book is.
Judging from all the positive reviews here on Amazon, and from friends and coworkers, I trust that there is something worthwhile here.
You know yourself better than most, right?
I should have trusted my own instincts.
Might be worth picking up at the library first.
I found myself skipping whole paragraphs hoping to get back to the storyline.
I finally got around to picking up a copy, and was pleasantly surprised for the first 75 pages or so.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find it.
Eventually, I just threw in the towel.
It did engage me.

When it came in it was damaged in the shipping.
This happens around the end where it gets the most movement.
This did not bother me plus i assume the next one would most likely come in the same way.
The hose turns brittle and cracks.
I figure I will either keep cutting the hose till i run out or I will buy a coupler and add some GOODYEAR hose.
I normally don't take the time to write reviews but here I go.
Otherwise it has been working great.
The round part was a little bent and some paint had chipped off but otherwise it worked fine.
I have had to cut off 1 foot of the end.
The reel is kinda heavy seems to be built well.
So I ordered this reel because it had good ratings.
I have been using it for about 6 months now.
I hope this helps someone make the right decision if they want to buy this.
I had read someone else had the same problem.
So if you buy this real be warned it maybe be damaged on arrival, the hose cracks, so you might want to replace it with a better goodyear one.

L.L.
?I will shut up now.
Okay, I must say this....
Give us a break!
HOWEVER, as a dictionary addict, I must say that, even on a planet with three suns, Equinox has nothing to do with noon, 'revolt', 'rebellion', and 'revolution' are not true synonims and cannot be used as such, and there was farrrrrrrrrrr too much product placement!
Also, must he give ideotic names to dangerouse things?
It is a very good book, if you can ignor those little problems..... Go ahead, read it.
how is that supposed to inspire fear in Anyone!
It cannot be used as a synonim for noon, ever!
Not the best I've ever read, but good.
Bean?
Milkyway bars?
This is a really good book.
Um, Equinox litterally means 'equal night', and refurs to the tine twice a year when the night and day are exactly the same length.
I know I'm still going to read it again.....
I mean, really, but reallly, QUIGS?

Like A Cat - FYI its not a filler.
I Drove All Night2.
Dancing With A Stranger - this is where her 90's sound started.
Its Fun and Cute as in her SSU album!3.
So for those who hate this track, might as well hate her entire album post ANTR.
So here are the tracks that make this album worthwhile:1.
Although, the sound may have sounded more generic than her new-wavey previous albums.
It may not be her best album, and neither is it her worst.
A Night to Remember4.
I Dont Want To Be Your Friend - filled with angst.
Unconditional Love5.
Almost doesn't sound like her.The only difference this album has compared to her previous killer albums was that it doesn't sound Fun anymore.
Suffice to say that she has changed direction, and that's a rap.
This album has been castigated far too long.
Besides, the vocals are nicely delivered.6.

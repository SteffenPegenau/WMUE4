But if you own this and have for sometime your lieing if you say it doesnt get hot sitting on your lap.
First off the thing will melt cheese it gets so darn hot.
Yes, Yes, I know I am probably one of the lucky few.
Build em so they work.
THE SCREEN IS MADE BY Samsung.
Consider yourself warned.
Otherwise it works as a great with the HDMI output.
This computer is not even Sony built.
Yes the sceen is made by Samsung.
I have already had mine overheat and blow a harddrive, my disc drive, and my fan.
I am fixing it myself and I repeat you are buying a Samsung Screen in a Sony Name.
Ok I'm gonna go be quick and sweet with it.
Second off If your impressed by the amazing screen you are seeing DO NOT THANK SONY.
Don't buy this computer unless you like paying more cause it says Sony or you want the Blu-Ray player.
Its called a "Lap" top for a reason Sony.
I found that if a chair falls on the screen it breaks.
Sony told me not to use it on my lap on at a desktop station.

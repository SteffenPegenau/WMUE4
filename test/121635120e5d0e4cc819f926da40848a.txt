Ok, I read all of the reviews BEFORE getting this for my 4 year old.
This thing worked right out of the box!
Other than that he is happily playing with it right now.

It take up about a 4X4 foot area, and is 4 feet tall.
I really took my time & read ALL of the instructions first!

If you think that a 4-year old is gonna put this together, you are smokin rope!The green car seems to work better than the yellow car.

We assembled it on the burber (sp?)

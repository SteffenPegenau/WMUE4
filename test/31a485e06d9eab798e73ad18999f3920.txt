And he just turned two.
It's a great little toy, but it's a shame that we cannot keep the legs on safely enough.
It happens almost every time.
He now primarily uses it for the piano, which he really enjoys.However, the legs pop off VERY easily.
Lots to do.
I would prefer it raised off of the floor.
He has little friends who come over for playdates, and it's almost always inevitable that at some point in the playdate, somebody is going to get hurt.
The kids love it.
So we finally took the legs off, and just keep the top part down on the floor.
Drama rama!
One of the kids always leans on it, or tries to sit on it, and the legs pop off.
And the kid falls down with it, and cries.
My son loves this toy.
It would make his room look a lot more tidy, if you ask me.
He enjoyed it more when he was younger, but he still loves it.

Yet the B.A.R.T.
I suppose that is typical for an undertaking that continues to grow.
She wrote the first major work on the trail.
official site is is pretty sketchy.
No maps, little else at all.
But the best way to present information about this trail would be on the Internet.
All her research was original.
The trail is a grand undertaking, but not adequately described.
And that's about it.
This review is not in any way a criticism of the author.
will have do dig for it.
But there is little else extant about the Bay Area Ridge Trail.
And it is incomplete.
And in 2002, it was somewhat timely.
So someone who wants to find out current information about the B.A.R.T.
And the Trail Council works with a very small budget.
The maps are poorly printed and difficult to read.
The book is out of date.

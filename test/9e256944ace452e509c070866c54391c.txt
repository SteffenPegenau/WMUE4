I'm not.
Carly takes her voice out of range a couple times and it sounds as if someone else's voice was inserted for a word or two.
I should have been in love with this CD.
Moonlight Serenade is slick and over produced.
Bottom line: Moonlight Serenade - 4 stars; My Romance - 5.
Don't get me wrong, I've listened to the CD twice since receiving it yesterday.
On her earlier My Romance, the production was solid, straightforward and unencumbered.
She tries to do clever things with her voice and as much as I love Carly's singing, she does not have a clever voice.
I've been a huge fan of Carly Simon ever since there was a Carly Simon.
(Benchmarks: Madeleine Peyroux and the "new" Diana Krall have clever voices.
I'll listen to it a lot more.
Nevertheless, I'm disappointed.
Norah Jones does not.)
On Moonlight Serenade, Carly tries too hard.
I'm also a huge fan of the standards.
Carly's voice was clear, clean and pure Carly.
It could have been a lot better.

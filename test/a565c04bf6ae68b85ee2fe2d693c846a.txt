It feels like the author didn't even bother with even asking a physical trainer what they do when they do an eval.
I thought I would enjoy this book.
Now if she is 227 she really might be only 60lbs overweight not 100.The second problem I had was when they were doing Lucy's fitness eval.
It started out wonderful.
I wonder did the author even do any research?
The weight range for a female who is that tall (that is tall because the avg height for a female in the US is 5' 3") is 127 to 158lbs.
The preview was witty and fun.
They don't put people in a tank of water to see how much of a person's weight is fat.
I returned it on Amazon.
The reviews all raved about this book.Lucy is 5'7 and 100lbs over weight?
What does that mean?
I love chick lit.
Which means Lucy can be anywhere from 227 to 258lbs.
All the need to do is step on a special scale that computes that.I couldn't even finish the story.
I was 9% in and gave up.

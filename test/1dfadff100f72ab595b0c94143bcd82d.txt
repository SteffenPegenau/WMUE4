I got the Razr and didn't like it.
;) It is a lil power house.
The graphics are so fun and almost .
I lOVE IT.
.
WELL, This is such a rad weird phone.
.
I LOVE this phone.
.
and I'm sure any teen would like it.
french weird or something, there is a Clown that pops up when you want to take a picture.
The online stuff works perfect, texting, downloading games, tones, etc.
It's like super "japan" cute animation phone for the kid at heart.
.
.
It's my favorite I've ever had, granted I am very young at heartt.
so I was frustrated and like "just let me buy that little phone" while speaking to cingular.
I love this phone.

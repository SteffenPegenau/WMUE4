So I don't watch it at the theater because the one in my town is too small.
However, it was decided to held back until Vin Disl became famous.
It was hard at first, but I got over it as long as I got to watch the movie.
So if you are a Seth fan and you want to see it because of him, rent it first and if you like it then go ahead and buy it.
I love the guy.
Then on a bad stormy day (in my mind) I learned that Seth was leaving Buffy to do a movie Knockaround guys.
By my title you can tell I am a Seth Green fan.
Big Mistake!!
You have been warned.
Thought Oz was the best character ever.
Well two years later the movie is released.
One I was bored, two there was maybe one scene I liked, and three Seth died in it.
You think.
So I stupidly decide to buy just cause Seth is in it.
Okay.

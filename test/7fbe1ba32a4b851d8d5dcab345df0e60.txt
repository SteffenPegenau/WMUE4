Never received the product.
I have been to their store in the past and spent much $ through the years.
After e-mailing them and 30 days later; I finally called them.
I immediately ordered from another seller.
away"... We haven't been away in years.They credited my account back.
They said it was returned by USPS; "addressee temp.
They said I could pick it up at their store.
I think the salesmen have been there too long.
She transferred me and disconnected.
Chose this seller because they are in driving distance.
Will see how that works out.
Always got the feeling that I was bothering them when I was there.
Tracking info showed that they received the product and estimated delivery date to me was 11.07.08.
They need some fresh blood who are interested in the customers needs.
My previous e-mail was never returned.
Retail is tough but nobody's holding a gun to their head.
I was never notified.

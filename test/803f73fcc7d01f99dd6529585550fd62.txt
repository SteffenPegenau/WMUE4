Theres not a bad song on here.
Every song on this 13 track disc is just as good as the next.
With 3 TOP 40 hits, which have won songwritting contests to boot, you can't loose.
He blew Foreigner away!!!
He blows John Mayer away!
!
It hasn't left my car since.
This guy should be MORE famous...
He makes it his own!
His voice is awesome, it's very powerful and soulful, and his lyrics are very heartfelt.
He has the best band I've ever heard.
Buy it today!
I first heard about Chris Emerson when he opened for Foreigner a month ago.
One gets the impression he really believes what he is saying- a very rare quality in todays cookie cutter offerings.
I read he was in the studio for a year making this CD, and it shows!
The bonus track is the BEST version of "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas," I've ever heard.
I don't get it.
I was extremely impressed with his live show, and was compelled to by the CD.
I felt bad for them.

They end uncerimoniously in mid solo, with a few exceptions (McCoy Tyner manges to complete Naima in the required time limit).
If you like appetizers with with no main course this is the disc for you.
The filming and sound is pretty much excellent throughout.
What can I say.
So what's wrong?
If the material were accessible at reasonable prices I would applaude this disc.
You will only find the total collection at Amazon UK for very hefty prices.
These are ticklers.
I find it very upsetting to fade out in the middle of a Joe Henderson solo.
This disc at first glance looks to be the motherlode that many jazz fans have been searching for on DVD.
Just try to find the concert films on line !!
So what is a jazz fan to do?
The lineups are spectacular.
As it is I found it upsetting, to say the least.
They are basically 4 minute segments from other TDK filmed concerts.
This is the rule not the exception.

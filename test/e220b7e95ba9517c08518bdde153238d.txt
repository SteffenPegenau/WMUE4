It actually was in the basement for about 6 months.
The sink falls out constantly.
We had to duct tape the microwave in place.
My son has enjoyed playing with it.
It's not going to hold up much longer.
He said it was horrible to put together.
The doors don't fit well.
It really is cheaply made.
The husband put it together and it took him 5 or 6 hours.
Some relatives bought this kitchen for my son for Christmas 2006.
Very low quality.
We take it out of circulation every once in a while, so it hasn't been played with constantly for the last year.
A week after Christmas one of the handles fell off.
Which this thing will probably last a few more months.
For a little bit more money you can get something that you can pass on, or re-sell when your child outgrows it instead of tossing in the trash.

I really regrett it that they haven't made a whole song out of it.
But it need's several run-throughs.The road goes on forever...(Fates Warning highlight)
they could have done better.
But their best is still the first with the extensive guitar and drum instrumentals.
Well the last "track" is just 1:30.
And it sounds really amazing.
Here Ted Leonard's voice is so intensive that it astonishes me every time I listen to it.
how can I say that?
don't get me wrong.
!This disc is very atmospheric, alomost calm.
I like the CD.
It really adds profundity to life if you listen to it.
Amazing.
It's acoustic guitar and vocals.
Maybe next time... By the way: a B I G Recommendation:Fates Warning - Parallels!

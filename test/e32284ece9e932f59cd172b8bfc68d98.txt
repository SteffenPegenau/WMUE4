The onlycharacter I truly liked was Travis.
If you consider purchasingthis book.
How can Karen Leewrite such an unrealistic book?
I'am truly disappointed with this book.
I felt very cheated.
Make your characters morerealistic and belivable
I was rooting for Travis until the author paintedhim as a green monster.
And DJ seems to be to overdrawnand boring.
Karen Lee will not get another dime from me!
Instead of having Everun after DJ.
I thought Eve was too shelfish and dellusional.
The author really was really rushing through thisbook.This book is not worth the $11.00.
I thought the author should havedevelop Travis and Eve's relationship.
Please read the reviews and come up with your owndecision.
Karen pleasetake your time with your next book.

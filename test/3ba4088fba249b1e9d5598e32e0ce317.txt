The reason we purchased the Mc Culloch was for the grout only.
!
I am here to tell you not to waste your money on this unit!
!
I would not give it one star but that is the lowest I can go.
It failed completely to remove any of the dirt from the grout.
!
We went over the grout by hand using tooth brush and bleach and the grout cleaned up great.
According to the information on one of the tile grout web sites this machine was reported to have done a great job.
I don't mean it cleaned a little.
We used it one time and we want to find out how to return it for a refund.
We purchased this steam cleaner to go over our tile grout.
!
We used it on several areas of tile grout and it FAILED to clean any of the areas tested.
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!

In this case only 1 song.
i'm out el rato!!
sucks!!!
I mean it this cd reaks!!!
Keep your money!!!
Heres another cd that umm...
Weird if you ask me wouldent you want people to like all your stuff not just a song or two.
maybe.
!
There again I wanted a song and I thought the cd would be good but listining to the song clips to the other songs they sound so weak.
Many artist are like this they just want to becaome popular for a song or to and make the rest of the cd sound horrible.
Well not worth it!!!
Get somthing else.
I'm telling you the music these days!!!
not worth it!!!
I don't know...
As for the final words on this album pity!!!
All the songs on here suck ecept 1 called (Mesa Que Mas Aplauda).
trash!!!
Man it's like these people do a great song so they will become popular but then the other songs they do are crapy.

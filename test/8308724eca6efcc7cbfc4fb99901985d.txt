***** 5 stars.Onto the production value of the DVD's.
Pretty interface, but no subtitles and cheesy extras.
Patient consumers have learned to wait for that set, staying away from more expensive individual DVD's.
They release a box set for every complete series they produce.
Good stories with interesting characters.
First the show.
ZERO stars.The final tally comes out to my rating.
I bought the DVD's to catch up.
*** 3 stars.
*** 3 stars.Finally, the production house.
A friend got me hooked on it, then I got stationed in Japan.
Then, as always, the box set comes.
It must be effecting sales, because the press release comes out, "we will not release a box set," they say.
Really little more than the episodes themselves.
This falls into the ENRON style business practice.

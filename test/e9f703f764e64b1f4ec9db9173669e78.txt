I especially didn't want Addie to fall in love with or marry Rye.
And really who cares about what Bamarre's hero did?
Yeah sure, it had adventure, excitement and romance, all the things I love to read about when I pick up a book.
And you can't even tell they're in love until the very end.
The 'excitement' wasn't exciting.
But in this book, the adventure part was boring.
I think Addie needed someone to fall in love with to make it more interesting, and the only person that could be was Rye.
I didn't like it.
If Addie had gotten sick and Meryl was the main character, I might have liked it more.
The romance part wasn't romantic.
Whenever I read romance books, I like those little tiny hints that make you totally see that they'll fall for each other.
But probably not.
This book was BORING!
I didn't like him at all.
This book wasn't all that great.

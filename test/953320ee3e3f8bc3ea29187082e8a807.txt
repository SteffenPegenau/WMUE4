HOW PRIMA?
I can get that info for free on gamefaq.com.
Where?
HOW DO I DO IT?
I'm still looking for the promised "gaurd breaks" list in the "character strategies" section.
I already know I need to learn the counter system to be effective at this game.
Sounds like it's something I'd really like to try.
The back cover of the guide promisses "expert lessons".
There's no lesson.
This guide makes it seem like an effective tool.
The booklet with the game tells me that.
Too bad that other then a general description of what a guard break will do for me, there's no actual instruction on the technique.Great I know all the character moves that you can't possibly hope to accomplish while the computer has you in a 99999 punch juggle.
There's no how to.
It's just more general suggestions.
I was actually better as a button masher at this game than I am armed with this worthless guide.

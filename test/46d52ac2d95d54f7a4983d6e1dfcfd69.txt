On the second use, it now will not turn off.
I purchased this for the lightness and versatility, as I was using it to maintain the cemetary.
They are excellenat to deal with, but they should get rid of this line.
I was sent a replacement bold with no problem.
Great job Amazon.
I wanted something that was lightweight for easy loading into an SUV.
On the first use, the wheel fell off.
Another number located, put me in touch with "O My Garden", who sent me the bolt.
The handle controls no longer work.
It is not equal to their way of doing business...
Once the switch is turned on, on the side of the battery area, it is running.
I put that back on, and putting it away, folding the handle down, the bolt broke.
The number listed on the mower itself did not work.
This is going back to Amazon.
Received the product as described.

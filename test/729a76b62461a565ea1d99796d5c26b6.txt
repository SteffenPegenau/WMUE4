I put this collar on my dog only at night so as not to wake us or the neighbors.
I bought this collar in June 2009.
However, it would come off at the clasp.Bark control did what it was designed to do.
The one I have has a metal buckle and also a black plastic clasp.
The photo doesn't show a buckle anymore.
At six bucks for a two pack, it's not bad at all.I'm really giving it 4.5 stars.
The collar has dramatically controlled his barking.
Maybe PetSafe made some modifications because there have been occasions when the collar came off.
In fact he doesn't bark when it's on him.
Now we have peaceful, restful nights.
Every dog will bark.
He's a Shepherd/Lab mix and has a loud thunderous bark.
I'm on my third battery since 2009.
Control the barking.
Since he learned his lesson, the batteries last a few months.
It's in their nature.
I would have given this product 5 stars if the red collar was more secure.

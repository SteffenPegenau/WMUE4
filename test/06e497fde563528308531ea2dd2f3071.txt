I dozed off.
In hindsight, I should have waved the white flag at about page 50 and moved on.
Stephanie Plum (hereafter referred to as SP) has Lula and Rex; Barney has Judey and Brian.
Every time they go to a convenience store, do we have to have a grocery list of every item they bought?
I've read every Plum book and loved them, and I was expecting METRO GIRL to be a fresh, new heroine from the cheese-doodle-stained keyboard of Janet Evanovich.
And there are too many lists in this book.
I only finished because I hate to admit defeat.
Wild Bill looked at girls' (...); Joe Morelli played choo-choo.
I found NASCAR Guy to be incredibly annoying.
Excuse me.
But sadly, this is simply re-hashed Plum.
SP has Grandma Mazur; Barney has Rosa.
I only finished the book because ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
We have doodahs and doodles and demolished cars.
I never felt any emotional attachment to him like I do with Joe and Ranger.

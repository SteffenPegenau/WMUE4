That is a big watch" or just "Wow, nice watch."
I don't know what the stuff is, but it's very comfortable and super durable.The glass is amazingly scratch resistant.
I usually get "Wow!
I just haven't been interested in any of the features from day one.
I say, yeah I bought it on the web and I had no idea how big it was going to be.
Very well put together.
Again, I think Nike is using alien technology - probably from the Vulcans.I don't use any of the features.
This watch is big.
There are a few I'm sure.
The band is some space age type super vulcanize rubber.
Oh yeah, did i mention it's huge.
It's surprisingly not very heavy at all.
Not even the slightest scratch.
It was really strange, I just took the instruction booklet and hucked in a drawer.That's all I have to say on this watch.
I'm only half joking.
I've looked at the face a couple of times after whacking it on a door or a computer or whatever and thought, "this is it, scratch city" and nothing.

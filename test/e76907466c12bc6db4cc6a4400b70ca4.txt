When I started playing I learned that instead of using dollars, you use Bells.
It is also fun because it's like real life,(i.e.)
In Autumn the leaves change color.
You may keep upgrading your house until you can't upgrade anymore.
Like, Toy Day (made up Holiday) or Christmas.
You can also make animal friends, obtain special items, and more.
I recently purchased this game, and when I got home I went direcly to my GameCube.
The animal who sold you the house tells you that you can have it but you have to pay off all the debt.
Once you pay off all your debt you upgrade your house and you're in debt again.
There are also real life, and made up Holidays.
Not only do you start off with a very small house you don't even have enough Bells for it.
A game of patience.
It really helps.
in the Winter it snows.
I also suggest getting a strategy guide.

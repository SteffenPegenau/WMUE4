This is not a fun beach read, this is dark and brutally honest and very frank in it's telling.
You really can't help but end up rooting for poor Mary Saunders.
How else does one write about prostitution in the 1764 England?
The novel is VERY graphic and is not for the prissy or squimish.
It was SO very dark even from the first page.
I applaud the author, how she took a small bit of history and totally fleshed it out and made it very believable.
However, the characters stayed with me for days after.
How easily she goes from schoolgirl to prostitute is alarming, but let's remeber the time frame.
I loved the Whore with a heart of gold, Doll.
It was a slow read, there was so much to absorb.
That said, the writing is very honest and up front.
I also felt for Mrs. Jones, and was shocked by her fate at the hands of Mary.
They were so vividly drawn.
I read some very favorable reviews of Slammerkin and decided to give it a try.
I enjoyed it very much and highly recommend it!

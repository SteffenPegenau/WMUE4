Maybe its because I listen to punk rock now, but its a little too angry.
He is much better in that.
Its too hard, all that Corey does is scream.
How can you listen to music and call it worth-while if you can't even listen to it.
Well, if I could give this zero stars I proboly would.
I would not recomed buying it ever.
There really is no good songs on this, except Duality.
He should ditch Slipknot and go back to Stone Sour.
I used to be a big time hard rock Slipknot fan, but it just is too angry for me.
I read the lyrics to songs and they're nothing impressive.
It just is well.............HORRID!
Maybe its because you can actually hear his voice.
Anyway, the cd is not worth 10 bucks.
It just sucked, and thats a nice way of puting it.
In punk bands it's cool, but Corey sucks at it.
The first album was good, the second was better but the third sucked.

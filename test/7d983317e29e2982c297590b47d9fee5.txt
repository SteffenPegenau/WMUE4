I still love Diana's previous work, but I think she needs to update the stories.
.
.
All in all, it's still an ok way to pass the time, but if you are a big-time reader of romance novels .
For SHAME Diana!
Why did this book need to come out in hardcover?
.
Did you think you were fooling us with the LARGE print and thick paper?
I agree with the previouse reviewers (except Harriett), if you change the cover, you've got the same OLD story.
Better luck next time, Diana!
If this were a paperback, then I'd give this book 3 1/2 stars.
and a loyal fan of Ms. Palmer's, you won't find this to be one of her best works.
This story was not worth the price and not worth waiting for.
.and if a man calls me "little one" as many times as Cord did, I'd run screaming from the house.
I think what really upsets me is that I feel like Diana is stealing from me.

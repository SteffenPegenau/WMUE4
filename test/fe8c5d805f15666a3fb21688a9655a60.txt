This book started so well.
The focus becomes the dull time spent between assasinations.
He accidentally becomes the wielder of an amazing sword, but doesn't know what it does.
His own magicians study and discover some of the features of the sword.
He is able to get back to his own forces.
Wonderful!
After a wonderful start that leaves open so many avenues for weaving an intricate tale, the author seems to have given up.
Just like a wood chip thrown into a river, the hero is a victim of circumstances even though he has possibly the most powerful weapon on the planet
A lost scout for the good side gets caught behind enemy lines.
The generals decide this will be their secret weapon.
Then the war ends by an act of god with no involvement by the main character!
Then something goes wrong.
The scout becomes their designated assasin.
Characters are talked about without any contribution to the storyline.
But that's not where the book ends.

Oh well... lesson learned.
I am on well water, but have a water softening unit.
I replaced the head and it worked great.
I went through all the troubleshooting tips in the manual.
I have little to no mineral build up on any of my other faucets in the house.
They sent me an entire new head assembly at no charge.
Right out of the box it worked like a champ.
Here it is mid-April and the faucet has started acting up again.
I bought this item in October 2010, but did not get it installed until late November - early December.
Since I cannot return it to Amazon, I will try to get my money back through Kohler.
The water pressure coming out of the head is pitiful at best.
I have adequate water pressure to the faucet, but it just won't flow out of the head.
Then the water flow started to diminish.
I called Kohler's customer service and they were very helpful.
This is an extremely pricey item for it to work so poorly.
That was in late February.

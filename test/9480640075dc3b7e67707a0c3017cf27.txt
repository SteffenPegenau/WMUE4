The CD offersa track for every mood I've had, and some I've neverexperienced.
Yet.If I were forced to characterize the CD as a body ofwork, I would say it definitely speaks Broadway production.And although the production quality is massive, it's notrequired.
No, it's kind ofbluegrass.
It's wonderful.And it continues to surprise with everynew track.
It's jazz.
No, it's Chicago TransitAuthority.
So JeffGeoffray is multitalented.I think my favorite is Bring Me Rain.
The beauty of the melodies and lyrics would beevident with a single guitar and solo singer.And it's certainly a showcase of Jeff Geoffray's versatility.I can't wait to see which direction this artist spins next.What's for dessert?
No, it's Talking Heads.
No, it's ballads.
I have just received First Barbecue.
No, it's funk.
But it depends onwhat I feel like when I'm listening to it.
What anincredible surprise!
What can I say?
Okay, okay.

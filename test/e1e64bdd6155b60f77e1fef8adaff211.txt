iTunes has this for less than 30 dollars.
I went to buy, but it was too much money.
He was only 15 or 16.
It kind of makes me sad to listen to this because when I was playing my parents were getting divorced.
You will probably still enjoy this soundtrack.
I had forgotten about it.
Wow, I had wanted this for a while.
Also, the guy I played with died in 01.
But, not everyone will have things like this to remember.
It has 4 disks that consist of 85 songs.
Seriously, it's that incredible.
If you have never played the game, that's fine.
Let me say it is amazing.
If you have played the game you will probably remember each song and what you were doing the day you heard it in the game.
I got it off iTunes.
If you want to spend more or know a place to get the CD for less then go for it.
I can remember the parts of the game the music is from.

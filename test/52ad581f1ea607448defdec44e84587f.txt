I strongly advise using VELCRO to attach your Kindle to the case.
Kindle support advises it will cost $180.00 to repair.
They answered my phone call promptly and professionally.
I am also a registered nurse accustomed to handling costly devices.
I have complained about this repeatedly to Amazon with no results.
I am retired and watched my Kindle like a hawk.
I am spending inordinate amounts of time trying to figure out which books are nonfiction.
Also keep in mind that the Kindle is fragile and the case does not securely hold and protect the fragile Kindle.
At the same time the case provides a false sense of security.
This is tedious and leaves me with less time to read.
I like it!
I picked my Kindle up, it slid out of the case, and fell on the floor.
Customer Support was excellent.
It only dropped once about four feet and now it is worthless.
You think the case is holding your Kindle.
Now that I own a Kindle I hope never to be without one.

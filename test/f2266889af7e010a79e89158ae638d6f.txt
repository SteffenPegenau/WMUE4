They are just useless.

2.Every time my baby kicks the board, the whole thing moves back.
I was hoping this toy can encourage him to kick and reach.
So this problem is not because my son is too tall.
And it kind of heavy.
I would not recommend this product to anyone.
The hanging toys are at my babies knees.
My son's height is at 50 percentile.
There are several things I don't like about this product.
1.
I'm hoping the other feature will work better when my son can sit up.
I bought this when my son was 3 month old.
He cannot really kick it nor reach by hands.
It is hard to assemble.
I still use this toy mainly because I already bought it and put it together.
And the board is hard!

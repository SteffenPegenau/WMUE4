I am so angry at this.Logitech Premium USB Headset 350 ( 980374-0403 )
Simple, inside the headphone, where the wiring is spliced to the headset speakers and mike, is about the smallest wire I've ever seen in my life.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product.
I doubt there is a wiring number for wire this tiny.
Good Lord!
Others have reported the same thing.
There is cheap and there is CHEAP!
I just don't see the reasoning for using such small wiring as there is enough room inside the headset for a decent wiring bundle.
So, a slight tug would bust it to heck and gone.
I am REALLY REALLY NOT HAPPY here.
And, it breaks!!
It is not user repairable and I am really loathe to own something I cannot get a soldering iron to, that involves elementary wiring.
There is no "strain relief" on the wiring cable leading inside.
I doubt anyone from Logitech can explain why they made a perfectly good product so cheesy.
It'll work until it breaks.

These won't fit in my Computer bag, but they pack well in my regular clothing bag.
They have their own top notch carrying case with a zipper.The USB power is a plus, no extra cords to carry around.
Remember you're traveling.
I use my laptopas my main Computer.
The front grills are metal and seem to be sturdy.
One major COMPLAINT is: they won't workwith my little Taurus travel usb hub.
They sound very good, much better than computer.
I use them on my Macbook Pro.
just think "fluff and fold.
Very nice with the DVD player.
I don't know fault that is.Remember: You can always return them and start over $ 80 at Best Buy
When I travel they are the best option.
Traveling isn't perfect.
The speakers must be plugged directly to the laptop or they won't work.
They probably could be overdrivenlike a lot of small speakers.

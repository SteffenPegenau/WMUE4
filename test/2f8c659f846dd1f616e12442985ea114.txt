No storm troopers.
So I finally found one for sale.
Hasbro isn't making Bossk in any of the current lineup.
Just droids and bounty hunters.
I gotta be a smartass and say "Bossk".
I'm not gonna be a typical geek and say "Boba Fett".
OK. No probs.
The up shot is I got it for a third of the price of a new figure.
No cantina aliens or intergalactic musicians or weirdos who hang around at Jabba's Palace.
The downside is he isn't as articulated as the newer ones, but the boy was happy, so whatever.
No rebels.
My son is all about collecting droids and bounty hunters.
Except that Bossk is out of production.
Bossk is the Bossk.
So he asks me who my favorite bounty hunter is.
No.
He says, "Well, get me your favorite bounty hunter for my birthday."

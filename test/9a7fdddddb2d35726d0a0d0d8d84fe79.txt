I believe that I was sent a wiper that was returned as damaged by another customer.
The replacement came today.
The box had already been opened and the blade was bent in the center.
I just received another replacement in pristine condition, sent overnight UPS.
The standard mount was missing.
Amazon's return policy is excellent.
This is a good wiper blade with bad, bendable packaging.
This time a smaller, more rigid box was used.
The only other mount was too large.
They shipped to me free and reimbursed me for the returns.
The 1st order with 2 wipers had one broken plastic end and was unusable.
When I went to mount it, the mount was too small.
Having been through returning the 1st blade I decided that this one was salvageable with a plier bend and a bolt with Loctite to replace the missing pin.
The pin for the mount was missing.
I returned the item for a replacement.
Until Amazon can supply an undamaged wiper, buy elsewhere.Update: The third time is a charm.

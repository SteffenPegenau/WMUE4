To me, it reads as merely an elaborated story based on an internet biography of Elizabeth Bathory.
I give this two stars.
Is it interesting?
Is it an easy read?
Some.
Yes.
Is it worth spending money on?
It would be one star, but the simple fact that it is about Erzebet Bathory gives it another.
NO (unless its really really cheap).
Yes.
Do you learn more about the Lady Bathory?
Ugh.
This book is a NOVEL, and as such, isn't that great of one.
It almost seems like a Hollywoodized version of a book, changing details and such to make the story flow better.
And a good third of the book doesn't even deal directly with Erzebet Bathory, but of some clunky trial.
It seems difficult to make a bad novel on one of the most intriguing figures in history, but nevertheless, this is a bad novel.

Now I have 2 holes to patch.
It is pretty obvious.
I've never seen any like it.
I finally got around to mounting this.
I moved it over a bit.
Can Amazon or Jerdon please send me a good one?
I took to long to get around to installing it.
Then I noticed the holes in the mounting plate are crooked.
I am not happy.
I even had plumbed it with a level but it was way off.
I finally got it up and it was crooked.
took it down to plumb it more carefully, but made the hole to close to the other one and drywall failed.
Check to see if your holes are level before you mount it.
Mounted it again with the level and it still came out crooked.
First the wall anchors that come with it.
They spin in the wall.
Now my window for complete refund has expired.

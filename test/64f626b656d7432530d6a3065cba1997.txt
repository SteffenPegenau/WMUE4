Just like Rivendell.
I have been a fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings since I was in the third grade.
Everything exactly the same.
Tolkien's touch was beautiful.
If Terry Brooks was just a fan of LoTR, he should have been more subtle, at least, in getting ideas from it.
Just writing doesn't make up a book.
They go to Culhaven or whatever.
You can't just copy somebody else's wonderful story plot by plot and expect to be called a wonderful writer.
It has been my absolutely favorite book since I first read it.
And now, I had to read this book.
Allanon.
Story is important too.
It was odd.
What is Terry Brooks thinking of?
Except for the important magic of skilled writing.
Really, Christopher Tolkien should sue.
How like he is to Gandalf.
People who say that story doesn't matter, even though it is obviously a copy of LoTR (anyone who is mature enough to really read must see it) I must say, who cares if the author is a great writer?
Look.

Obviously a programming glitch.
Then it will advance to the episode.
I give Electric Company 5 stars, the DVD's 0 stars!
I love the Electric Company but am dismayed at this major "glitch" on the DVD's.
After this segment, it should obviously go to the episode.
The New 4-DVD set however (at least mine) has a defect.
I also tried going to the menu screen and accessing the episode there.
But no.
You think they would have tested everything out before mass distribution.
The only way I could get to the episode was to use the move ahead arrow on my remote while Rita is introducing the episode.
It skips the episode and goes to the next into w/ Rita Moreno.
They loved The Electric Company.
Before each episode, Rita Moreno makes a few comments.
It takes you to Rita, who is presenting the episode but then it passes the entire episode and takes you to Rita's next introduction.
It was so great to show my kids what I grew up with.
Same thing.

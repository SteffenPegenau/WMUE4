Faith has done much better then this album.
But I'm still not crazy about this album.
The songs on here are just so different for Faith.
So its not because it wasn't country.
Some of the good ones are "Free", "Cry", "Beautiful", and "This Is Me".
It grew on me over time.
But after listening to this album some more, I've got to where I like it more.
I just wouldn't say that this is Faith Hill's best album=o)
I wasn't too crazy about it at first.
But really to me, it don't matter if its country, pop, whatever... good music is just that, good music!
So if you do purchase this album, I would say to listen to it more before you trash it.
I think if she wanted different, she could of picked a better choice of music.
There are some good songs, but not the best.
One song that I didn't like at first but grew on me later is, "One".
Yes, it don't sound country at all.
When I first got this album, I was alittle surprise of how much different this album was from her others.

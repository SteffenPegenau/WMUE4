I wish that I could see them live very soon.
Hopewell is the band of the future.
And this is pretty cool.
It is dramatic epic rock that can be quiet and quite hard sounding.
"Calcutta' is pretty simple rock.
Hopewell is another band that has famously had some contact with Mercury Rev and Dave Fridmann.
This is definitely one of the most promising records this year.
All the twelve songs are imaginative and very striking.
They are definitely a cool new band with some funky influences.
Some songs like "Praise Twice" recalls late 1960s blues like Cream.
Hopewell is a band to check out.
This is piano based music that definitely is worth listening to.
Other songs like "Sugar In The Honey" and "Synthetic Symphony" show obvious signs that Russo was in Mercury Rev at some time.
Jason Russo used to play in Mercury Rev, and has moved on.
My life would be enriched.

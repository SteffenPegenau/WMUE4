The idea was a simple Christmas solution that would suit everyone on my list.
Once the frame arrived the first thing I noticed is that there are no instructions on how to download pictures.
Once the pictures were loaded I noticed that the quality leaves much to be desired.
My sanity....priceless...and gone.
I now have to find a way to get the pictures on the card.
Memory card reader $45.00.
I ordered 7 of these frames based on price and the good reviews I read.
Again, frustrating.
Again, frustrating since the memory card the frame needs is different from my camera and it will not fit my laptop.
NOTE: You will need to load the memory card with pictures before using it in the frame.
Very frustrating.
The frame only holds about 10 pictures and a memory card is needed after that.
Memory card $19.99.
You cannot load pictures to it directly, once it's in the frame.
Frame $70.00 plus dollars.

????
I've bought this DVD EXPECTING these features.
A complete waste of a classic.
This looks completely hacked together by Photoshop.
Lies!
It isn't a double-sided "special edition".
The features listed above are not here.
er....????
I hope somebody there is reading this.
Also take a look at their ridiculous "modern" redisign of To Live and Die in LA.
This DVD is not as advertised!
You've made the LIST.
I have a DVD-ROM player and could find no such hidden menu features.
BEWARE!!
You can clearly see where the original picture was cropped, and they cropped the laser sight.
Their package designed is half-arsed.
A waste.
MGM is a complete screw-up company.

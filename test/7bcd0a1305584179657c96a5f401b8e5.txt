Gaps in the pictures.
I couldn't get it to recognize some of the CD's that I burnt with Roxio Toast on the Mac.
I tried to find out whether there is a new version of the firmware.
I also tried to play a slide show from a CompactFlash.
Lost of color channel information.
Also I couldn't get XP to recognize the drive.
The firmware seems to be very buggy.
I am also returning the Apacer because I think these products are still immature.
I got it from Amazon today and immmediately decided to return it.
I'll stick with my laptop for the meantime.
But addonics website has a broken link and I cannot download the "new" firmware.
While it has a few bugs I have none of the problems with Addonics.
I have also tried the Apacer CP200 which is a similar product.
Probably haveing problems with Joilet extension (long names).
e.g.
Some of the pictures were displayed incorrectly.

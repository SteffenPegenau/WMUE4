i followed the reviews on this site and purchased the disc believing that that they were correct and it was a good cd.
hear the first song on youtube.
DO NOT BUY THIS DISC.
i would rank this disc a -2 out of 5.
i have looked into the bands music influence and it was supposedly based on aerosmith whitsnake and another.
i took one for the team in following these idiots reviews.
TO LET YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF PERSON RANKED THIS MY MUSIC PREFERENCES ARE GUNS N ROSES,OLD METALLICA, SKID ROW, JUDAS PRIEST,RATT,DOKKEN, ETC.
i was fooled into buying this disk.
this is a disc with only one good track which is #1. the rest of this album is complete crap.
if you have heard the first song the rest of the disc is nothing like it.
the whole album is like love ballads and something for your girlfriend only!!!!!
i would not recommend this to anyone.
IT IS VERY OVERATED.
I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS DISC.
THIS ALBUM SUCKS.

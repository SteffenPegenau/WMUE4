This was my view, entirely.
Pretty weak.
Well, this is another movie in the "losers win" genre of screenplays.
Fantasy?
Other times, they try to be successful by hitting you between the eyes with a two by four.My head hurts.
"This is too weird!"
I agree.
I just expected more, a LOT more.
Not on this planet.
The race dichotomy is very troubling.Now this movie did have its funny segments.
Like Encino Man, Weird Science will not go done as a comedy classic.
Sometimes, these movies really are funny and nicely done (Nerds, In The Army Now, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and especially The Breakfast Club).
Weird Science had a weak, weak, plot.
How to get a date?
Pretty lame.
It seems as if the goal was to allow teenage boys the opportunity to consider... what?
is what a teenager told me.
Heroism?
The exit comments of the bikers were pretty funny.

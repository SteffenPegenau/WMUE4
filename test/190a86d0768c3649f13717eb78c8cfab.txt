12 songs make it worth your time.
It reminds of deftones how they went softer.
For a band in this genre there really isn't any.
The first album was straight out death metal.
The vocalists is great, he has the availability to make his voice go hard and soft.
If you want an excellent cd that is not only well produced, and skillfully played .... add this to your collection.
Embodyment's style is unmatched which is good.
I like all songs, but the best are: Winterkiss,Pendulum, Assembly Line Humans, and Killing the Me in Me.
The guitars have are tuned just right.
The new one examplifies a evolution in style.
You still get plenty of screaming in this emo/alt/metal album.
It's the most a band can change in two years.
Embodyment has went to extremes.
The lyrics are perfect.
Liner notes are all there, unlike some bands.

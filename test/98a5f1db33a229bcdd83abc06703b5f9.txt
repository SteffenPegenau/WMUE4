there you fight demons and uncover secrets of soom world.
geez.
they're fun.
it's a good game.
you have are Marche.
final fantasy.
and destroy crystals to get back to your own world.
some kid in a little town that you moved too.
but it's fun and has a good story line and fighting system is the same as final fantasy tactics for PS.
you go to a school meet some friends, one of em finds a book, makes a wish, a BOOM!
always with the crystals.
that's it.
you're in another world.
and become an assassin or a ninja.
so get it.

(Except Rick Dean.
Carno3 was aiight,the special effects were kinda stiff and unconvincing, and the acting wasn't all that.
But, anyway.
If you're gonna see this movie, watch it in the dark.
It'll help the movie ALOT!
If you want my opinion on the SPFX, I think they shoulden't have shown the dinosaurs.
Yeah, the SPFX suck, but they're very, very fun, and the gore scenes are, well...uh, GOREY, but that's cool!
They should have shown just the shadows, or hands, or just an eye or something.
He was AWESOME in this movie!
NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING could have been done to help that movie!
I'm glad Jon Winfrey brought him back from Carnosaur 2 as a different character.)
Carnosaur 3 delivers, but in NO way like the Jurassic Park movies.
That goes for Carno2 as well, but not the original Carnosaur.
Okay, I LOVE both the Jurassic Park movies.
That's VERY cool!

Then hate him again.
No Paul.
It's so wishy washy how both characters are.First he realizes that she's untouched when she wouldn't let him get to second base.
Fast forward 6 chapters where he's furious when he hears a rumor she's slept with dozens of men.Second, she loves Paul.
So he runs to her begging for forgiveness which she gives easily.If this was a real couple, they would die by murder suicide.
No love him.
And figures out that 8 months was the engagement time she asked for and she wouldn't be THAT much of an idiot if she was pregnant.
UGH.Then there's this back and forth of will they and won't they after he basically rapes her, that really is a mess of a time.Then he thinks she's pregnant with a bastard child.
Hate him again.
No Claremont.
Then Love him.
No Nicholas.
No Claremont.
Then Marry him.
NO Paul.
Hate Claremont.

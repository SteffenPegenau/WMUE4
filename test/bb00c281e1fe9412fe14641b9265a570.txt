I DO know I really like these phones!
When I first got them, I found myself asking, "Can you hear me alright?
", just to make sure.
I always had to yell into the phones I've tried before.
I wish I had a dollar for every time I've had a person on the phone that said that to me.
"What did you say??"
I'm very happy with them and the features they have.
I'm not used to that.
Maybe those folks just got 'lemons' or maybe they're hyper-critical...
Not with these Panasonic DECT 6.0 phones.
The only weird thing is when on the phone, I don't hear my own voice coming through the speaker.
My mother and father can hear me perfectly now and so can everyone else.
I know there have been a few bad reviews on this phone but from me, nothing but praise.
I don't know.
Talking to my parents, who live out of state, was very difficult.

Perhaps they are.
It's just that they keep sliding off.
My husband laughed when he saw them on me and said "boy, did they see you coming"!
Perhaps my toes are too small.
I think, well there went ten bucks down the drain.
I suggest to try that first.
THEY STAY PUT!!!
Who would have thunk for a dollar and 99cents you could get same effect!
Can't imagine the real ones being worth that much.
I am using these "cheap"er ones now and do see some minor benefit from the idea.
I have some ball of the foot and toe issues of late and saw the "real yoga toes" on a search and decided to save $25.
LOL Well, try this...
I am reaching down often to get back on.
I remembered I had some pedicure toe seperator sponge things... low and behold...
I was going to return them but since I wore them I thought not.
WOW!

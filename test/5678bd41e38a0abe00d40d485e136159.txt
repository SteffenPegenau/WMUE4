It's THAT good believe me.
Album Version - a decent mix - rating 3/52.
My rating 5/5.4.
It's Pink - You Make Me Sick (Hex Hector & Mac Quayle Club Mix).
Here we go (i'm into club music only so my ratings may not always suit you):1.
fast & furious mix and i love it!
Noizetrip Mix - very slow and sounds R&B; to me - 1/5.5.
Who cares about the video when you can easily get a SVCD verison or better ^^ Still it's funny.Someone mentioned the Hani mix.
Junior Vasquez & Dynamix Club Mix - this is a gem!
If you like Junior's or Dynamix mixes you must buy this.
The only reason there is to buy the CDS.
I bought it only few minutes after i heard the mix.
It's not that good.
D-Bop 3am @ Crash Mix - a decent mix - sounds breakbeat, electro - sounds good but not too fast BPM, vocals seem too quiet in this mix - anyway 3/5.3.
I know only one Pink mix that i find better than Junior/Dynamix.

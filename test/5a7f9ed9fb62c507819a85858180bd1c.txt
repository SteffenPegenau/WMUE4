During the first few minutes I asked, "Is this the UNCUT VERSION?"
BUT, since I was watching w/ my teens, I have to say the language/vulgarity/absurdity was ABSOLUTELTY DISGUSTING!!
This time NOT SO MUCH!!!
I scream, "ENOUGH!
TURN IT OFF!!!
"DON'T be fooled by the previews!!!
I didn't even get to watch the end of this movie.
PLEASE RECONSIDER!!!
Then the ORGY scene came on!!!
TURN IT OFF!!!
(Independently)Their previous movies were funny, so I gave this one a chance (way longer than I SHOULD have).If I was only going to watch a stupid, mindless, funny movie with usually FUNNY actors, ALONE w/ ONLY ADULTS in the room...
Usually, I enjoy their style/humor.
I MAY have watched the WHOLE movie.
!I like Stiller and Vaughn.
A few minutes later, "Are you SURE this isn't the UNCUT version?"
(ESPECIALLY, in mixed company!)
As I said, I did not watch this movie to the END!
i watched the previews for this.... it looked funny.
No matter how much you think that Stiller+Vaughn = FUNNY...
I'M DONE!

I barely break a sweat on the 60 min.
I ate normally and lost 2 lbs.
Finally The Firm has done it.
I was impressed with how I was sweating after only a 20 minute workout.
I can't wait to see the results after 5 weeks of doing these.
ones.
I'm used to Jillian Michaels and Bob Harper workouts.
This week I'm doing the week one DVDs mixing in a workout on T/Th too though.
So far, I did the Kickstart workout plan the first week without doing the eating part.
Good luck!
I totally recommend this workout kit!!!
I still love them!
I'm in excellent shape and expect a lot from my DVDs.
I really have only 5 to lose (perfection, right?).
I have a few The Firm Dvds and have not been impressed with any of the workouts.
I love all the DVDs so far.
I thought for sure I would do this workout 3 weeks and return it.

Funky neckstrap3.
It's basically unusable now unless I want to hold it to my ear and that kinda defeats the purpose.
I like being able to charge via USB and it comes with home and car or via laptop chargers making that a big plus.2.
I don't want to hassle with returning or calling customer service.
I think it might have gotten too hot staying in the truck and the rubber gave way.
Earloop loosened and made the device unusable.2.
Pairing was a breeze3.
Seemed clear for the person I was talking to.4.
Plenty of attachments and charging addonsCon:1.
Earbud pops off too easy.
I used the headset for about 2 weeks and went back to my Ericcson that is also average.
I don't have patience for that.pros:1.
Volume wasn't loud enough for me.
I found myself pushing it into my ear to hear clearly.
I would probably still be using the headset if it weren't for the earhook loosening up and now the earpiece just falls off my ear.
Got lucky I thought I lost it4.

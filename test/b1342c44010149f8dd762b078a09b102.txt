Well, she should be.
It's a wonder why she's not a BIG artist.
This gal can really sing!
This album Becker pays tribute to her Irish roots and her grandparents as she relates in the title track, 'Immigrant's Daughter.'
Her work carries over into 'Falling Forward' album.
This can be heard in 'This is My Passion,' 'Hunger Stays,' 'I Commit' and "People Get Ready.'
She digs deep into her spiritual longing in family traditions.
So why isn't Becker one of the top performers in Christian music?
Another you can't pass up.
You're missing out on the best.
She accomplishes this in the passion of her songs.
Maybe that's a blessing in disguise.
This album was named one of the top 100 best gospel albums by CCM.
Just try one of her album and see what you're really missing.
The music is a mixture of mellow folk rock with some bluesy overtones and a little irishness.
Margaret Becker voice is phenomenal, plus her musical talents are on top.

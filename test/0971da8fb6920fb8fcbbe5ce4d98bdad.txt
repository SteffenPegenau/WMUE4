I expected better for 8$.
There are better ones out there for that price.
Somehow a small pin size hole is in the side.
However, its tough to open so the best way is to use your teeth.
I thought it would be good.
First of all the bottle felt pretty durable at first.
However, afer having this thing for a little over a month, it leaks from the side.
Its a squirt bottle style lid.
So within a week your bottle looks beat up and old.
So you have to pull up to have it in the open position.
I don't know how it started leaking, but it does.
I have no idea how this could have happened.
I take it to work and it sits on my desk all day then I bring it home and do it again the next day.
When you do this a few times the lid starts looking pretty rough.
Also, the top is tough to put in the open position.

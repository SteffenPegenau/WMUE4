At other times it takes on more of a lead role.
You'll hear great "Asia-like" guitar work from Thor Stone and incredible keyboards.
Admittedly, the vocals improve progressively throughout the cd.
Bottom line, if you love keyboards and good guitar work this is a fine progressive cd.
With an album of this sort the female vocals felt out of place.
This cd by Cromwell is amazing except for one thing--the vocals.
The lyrics are interesting hinting at epic themes.
They just get better and more complex throughout the cd.
The keyboard work is at times "atmospheric" and complements Thor's guitar work.
Additionally, the vocals are actually poor for the first vocal track.
Anyway, the vocals perhaps should have been from a male (no sexism intended).
Maybe the vocals will grow on you.
Now back to the vocals.
Same for the keys.
I have no idea why the band chose a female vocalist unless it's because she may be the brother of the keyboardist (same last names--Taeffener).

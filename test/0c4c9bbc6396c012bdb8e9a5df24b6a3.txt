I think that's a little harsh.
It's a very fun book to read.
Since then I realized that the book could've been better.
Farber's idea for writing a book like this was a very smart thing to do.
One reviewer says, "Don't waste your money."
To me this isn't useful.
When I saw this book at Barnes and Noble, I had to buy it since I was interested in learning languages.
To me the most useful information is the section about parts of speech.
His book inspired me to write mine.Brandon Simpson
This book is not a waste of money.
At first I loved it because it gave a lot of information about other languages.
For example, he could've gone into greater detail with grammar.After reading some other reviews, I decided to add more to this review.
Don't get me wrong.
I just think it could've been better.
Farber fills the book with a lot of hype about why he learned languages and not enough of HOW he did it.
The rest of the book is about his life of learning languages.

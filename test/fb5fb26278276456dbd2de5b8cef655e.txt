Give him a break!
He has a brand new style now, which started with 6:66, not 5!!!
The only thing that lacks a bit is his band.
I am sick of hearing people say that this album is terrible.
The instrumentation is not as impressive to me.
Anyone who wants him to go completely back to the old style needs to give that up.
6, 7 and 8 obtain his new style.
Ain't happenin'!
This album is very similar to 6, in my opinion.
His new style is still awesome!
This is a good album!
Y'all just need to learn how to bend a little!!!!!
Anyone who says that 6:66 is bad should not even be given the time to speak their thoughts.
Maybe the albums are not as good as 1-4, but they are very good.
No big deal!
Glenn's voice and lyrics are very good.Guys, he has changed paths and styles!

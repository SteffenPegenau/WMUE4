We bought this one that we have now at the end of August 2011.
These percolators should last years!
Five months!!!
We have only had this for 5 months.
The coffee is barely warm even when you let it sit for a while.
This is the second and last Faberware coffee pot that we buy.
If they send us another one maybe that will buy us some time so I can find a good brand.
I am going to call the customer service line tomorrow to see what can be done about this.
We can't find any other brands besides Faberware to buy now though.
The first one we had a year and that one almost caused a fire.
My husband plugged it in the wall and it shorted out.
Wish me luck in finding a good brand!
Well it turns out that we think the thermostat is gone.
The other day my husband who always lets me make his cup of coffee said - hey you aren't making the coffee good anymore.
A couple of years ago we had a GE percolator and it was great - we bought it at Walmart.

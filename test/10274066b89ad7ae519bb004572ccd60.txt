So avoid this horrible.
The clock is easy to set, but is a poor visual quality.
The light on the clock is horrible.
Don't be fooled by Homedic's description.
they are terrible.
It's a very poor quality.
they sound like static, and the sounds are way too repetitive.
And, the speakers are 9n the back.
That makes it sound like it's coming from your other room.
the buttons are not good.
the radio tunes ok, but it is a poor sounding radio.
So avoid this and get a better system taht will work better for a long time.
even worse, the nature sounds are horrible.
this is not a spa product.
Sorry, but this product is a piece of junk.
It broke after two weeks.

I normaly go for a run and use my Moto HT820 blue tooth stereo headphones.
I'm the guy who's nick name is Gadget!
Random volume changes was another problem.
even if they make me look like Princes Leah or robbie the robot!
When I saw the S9 I though it would be an instant improvement!
When the music went from track to track it made beeps and sometimes changed volume.
But what I experienced was Less than a quarter the Battery life (5 hours).
The technology did not work well with my Moto Q.
Smaller, lighter and newer tech.
I LOVE AMAZON because they refunded my money!
The S9 I had eventually stopped working.
They sound great and work very well with the Q.
Every button you press made an anoying beep.
Well I'm back to using my HT820 and Love It!
My phone is a Moto Q and I also use it as an mp3 player.
Not super comfy... feels like wearing the wrong size stethoscope backwards.

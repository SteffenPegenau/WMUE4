So I looked at the bottom and it appeared to have some dust particles on it.
Being brand new I figured they would hold even better right out of the package.
I placed it on my dash (you can only place it on a flat part-any slope and stuff falls off)!
I had been using Velcro to hold my cell phone.
I wiped the surface again & washed the pad with soap & water to make sure it was clean.
I saw these in an office supply store.
It held for a few minutes.
Back to the Velcro!
I bought two of these pads.
I think my dash is vinyl though.
Well, I wiped off my dash with a dry cloth like it says.
Anyway, the sun ruins any stickyness it had and I gave up on it.
I thought, why is this so loose?
- who has a car that doesn't have leather?
With the sun beating down on my dash, the pad became so loose that I ended up placing it on my leather passenger seat (it says don't use on leather!
Remounting it, I then laid my phone on top of it and headed for a 200 mile trip.

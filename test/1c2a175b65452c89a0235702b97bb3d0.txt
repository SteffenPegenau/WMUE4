Time till entry?
No run that we were captives to an action.
The dog died because I let her run free.
I wanted to run and tell my momma on ya'll.
I'm giving this toy's educational value five stars.
I broke.
Sometimes value is reflected in how we learn not to act.
The dog's being loose -- lack of smell - meant I was unable to give it meat.
I was given a few seconds with the pile.
There was no escape, and no run.
The dog went through the entry, changing its name.
Puddled, our interaction lacked a fluid.
Nutrition was usually left outside the service entrance.
A truck then came at very fast paces.
I've learned more in Georgia.
She was a yelper.
My fault, crazy at the end and leashed - air being left in a flat to sour - lay down to perform the angel in creamed corn I would not be hungry enough to eat.
A service entrance left the dog loose.
I soon pupped and found pain was involved.

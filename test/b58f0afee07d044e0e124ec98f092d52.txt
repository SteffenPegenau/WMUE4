Who wants more?
At least it's better than WOMAN HATERS (1934).
The Stooges and Lucy.
"Did you ever see and apple with the skin on the INSIDE?"
It should've won.
A+WOMAN HATERS (1934) is the only short on the tape that is bad.
A-THREE LITTLE PIGSKINS (1934) is funny, co-starring Lucille Ball.
A-This also includes MICRO-PHONIES, one of Curly's best.
Curly's maze of pipes is great, even though Shemp does it better in VAGABOND LOAFERS (1949).
A-PLUMBING WE WILL GO (1940) is my favorite Curly short.
This is the first short, and one of the worst.
There are great gags.
There's some funny scenes.
Spoken in rhyme.
It's got hilarious scenes and tons of fun.
This was the only short to even be nominated for an Academy Award.
D-PUNCH DRUNKS (1934) is okay.
C-MEN IN BLACK (1934) is great.
This deserves to be nominated for an award.

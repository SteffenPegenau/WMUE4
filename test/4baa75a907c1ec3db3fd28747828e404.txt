I got what I wanted, but now I can't use half of it!
Windows uses FAT32.
Anything stored over 1GB seems to become corrupted.SO ...
It's a good feeling.
Doesn't sound like much, but it makes a big difference.
Scandisk's card is, as always, very high quality.
For one, the Samsung phone can only read the card if it's formatted in FAT.
The card MUST be reformatted correctly, or my phone can't read it.
Unfortunately, once formatted to FAT, I can only store up to 1GB on it.
I had to just stare for aminute.
When I saw the card ...
There's 2GBs on a card THAT small!!
And it works effeciantly.My cellphone, on the other hand ... dosn't totaly like it.
I was very impressed with the speed of shipping and package condition.
If you plan on using the card in a Cell, make sure you know the format you Cell uses before buying anything over 1gb.

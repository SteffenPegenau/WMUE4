Bravo.
She had a little group of die hard fans.
It is a little more experimental too.
She was a little raw and a little like Tori Amos.
It's almost like a real rock record.
This album has hope and passion all through it.
Charlotte Martin is good looking too.
This is a real mature record.
Back then she was doing just voice and piano.
Stromata is like a scientific term.
We had a good talk.
Charlotte Martin hasn't really been conservative at all.
I did an interview with Charlotte Martin a few years ago.
She knows a lot about music and can play and sing really well.
I like songs like "Drip" and "Little Universe."
It's exciting stuff.
Now she has a full band and the sound is more complex.

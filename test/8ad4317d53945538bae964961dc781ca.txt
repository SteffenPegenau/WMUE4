The kitty that played Church was great!
I did miss the wendigo though!
I liked Denise Crosby as Mrs. Creed, and the kids were good.
Stephen King's book PET SEMATARY scared the $#!t out of me!
Seeing his baby face made things far less terrifying than just showing his back, or a hand (like when the hand came from under the bed) or his shadow running past.
Oh yeah, and how about the fact that the only traffic on the road seemed to be those speeding ORINKO fuel trucks?
Enjoy...
The actual pet cemetery and the Mic Mac burial ground were well done.
Pretty funny!
Really, the only complaint I have about the movie is the showing of the resurrected Gage.
Anyway, PET SEMATARY had it's moments.
Fred Gwynne made a decent Jud Crandel too.
Dad was okay as well.
I guess I just wanted to be scared $#!tless again!
I found the movie version entertaining, but not quite as frightening.
Zelda was suitably creepy, as she lurched about wheezing and cackling.

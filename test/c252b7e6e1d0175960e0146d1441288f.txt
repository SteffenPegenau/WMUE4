Good and popular writers, but their work is still very easy to come by.
Same for Bradbury, who has a very nice one-volume collection, and for Clarke and Bester.
They point out to you their writers' vision.
A good Idea.
Why buy stories you already own?For starters then.
The truth: There are better anthologies out there.Whatever your decision, do check out the first item in this series.
Hope this will be helpful to would be buyers.This book is not very interesting for an advanced SF reader.
Still, it's your decision.
Why?Writers featured in this book are Asimov, Bester, Bradbury, Clarke and Norton.
The stories in this anthology will tell you that these writers deserve to have a single-author collection on your bookshelves.
I'm the first to review this book.
Buy his two-volume collection.
It's somewhat better.I appreciate this series.
Some stories in here are classics, others are mere filler.
You won't throw your money away.
Want stories of Asimov?
Buy this book.

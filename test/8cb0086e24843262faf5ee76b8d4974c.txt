Sure, they say they spend hours practicing.
The kids in them know nothing about wrestling.
They've had no training.
We've had very minor injuries (cuts, bumps on heads), so we learn from those mistakes.
Not worth anyone's money.
But me and my frineds do it for fun.
Backyard wrestling videos are stupid.
...that it's [awful] .
They might as well be practicing with assault rifles.
They just hit each other with weapons and severely injure each other.
Sure, I'm in a backyard wrestling fed.
The kids on these videos wrestle on concrete and dirt, they use the trampoline to do backflips onto people, and, when someone bleeds, the other guy tries to open the wound further!
But, if a kid spent hours practicing football, and yet had no training whatsoever, he'd be killed.
We've never doubled an injury.
We use fake weapons (meter sticks, shoes), we use a trampoline, we do simple moves, and, if we mess up, we stop.

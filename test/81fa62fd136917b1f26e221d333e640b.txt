I loved all the actors and felt they were believable in their performance.
The other unexpected outcome of RENT: I have an AUTISTIC 2 year old that will sit and watch the ENTIRE film.
This is a huge milestone for someone who is autistic.
I have not seen in on stage and now would love to.
It's a hard one to describe.
He sits in the bean bag to watch it.
The first time we put the movie on, he stopped spinning a toy he had been playing with and walked right up to the TV.
I could identify with every single character.
In the FILM, even though they were all dirt poor, the second you came into their lives, you were "family."
He actually tries to dance when ANGEL dances.
He's interacting.
I wasn't quite sure about RENT.
That was something striking about the film and I don't know why I picked that up.
So you can see why RENT is an all around favorite of mine.
You have to watch it with an open mind.

It's as brilliant as anything else Cunningham has done, even if it does feel like a Taco Bell commercial directed by David Lynch (not a bad thing mind you).
I hope he makes a feature someday (even if it takes 40 or 50 years).
Cunningham has been over this format before (6-7 minute shorts).
And again.
It's time to graduate to something bigger Chris.
I was really hoping for more.
It is brilliant, don't get me wrong.
It's just another music video.
Don't be afraid.
I just was hoping for more.
I'm glad I didn't pay $20 for this.
I guess I was hoping for at least a 30-minute short film.
I know you can do it.
Give us a really messed up 40 minute version of Rubbber Johnny.
But I'm sure I will watch it again and again.
According to Warp's site, this thing was 4 years in the making.
Not as much dancing this time though.
Something along the lines of Lynch's 'The Grandmother'.

The image shown gave me the impression that, while not of significant size, the masks would at least be identifiable from a short distance.
But I have to say, for me.
.
I could see paying $20 or even $25 for this, but, personally, I don't think it's worth $40+.

Both of the prior reviewers gave it five stars and said they thought it was wonderful.
I purchased this bracelet for one of my son's friends, who just turned 16 and loves the theater--and I'm decidedly disappointed.
And they're really not.
Well, it seemed like a good idea and I wanted to love it.
Maybe it's me?
.
I wish I had time to look for something else.
not so much.

The drama masks are so small one can barely see them and the sterling silver feels featherweight.

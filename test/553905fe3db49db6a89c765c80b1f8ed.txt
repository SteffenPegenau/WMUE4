I do belive that that my friends is a first for the xbox.
Basicly looks like Medal of Honor.
But it is still good.
I first got this game for the ps2.
Nothing can beat halo except halo2.
Why, Halo is like the god of all fps.
now that we have that out of the way we can get to the game.
I mean I am not telling to buy this game that is wrong.
So over all is is a fun experience.
I love killing Nazis from the comfort of my own coutch(I know i spelt it wrong).
But if you can get a better game than that I would encurage you to play it.
After reading some other revies on this game I seem to find every one is relating it to halo.
But wait this game supports online play.
So after i sold the ps2 version I dicided to pick up the xbox vesion.
YAY, WWII online.
Dont buy this game for the ps2.
A game with far more realistic plot.

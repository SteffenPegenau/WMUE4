But it does have infectious beats and some stunning production.
STROBIC LOVE
And here is why:It's not the best electronic cd in the world.
Tracks 1 & 10 are key.They are really a live act anyway.
Is there better electronic/house out their?
It's not even the best on their label.
At least this stuff is getting a listen and it's not half bad.
The house purists think it's the devil and the newbies/ad execs think it rocks.
By god yes!
Should you buy this disk?
).But, "Vegas" is good for a few spins in it's own right.
Yes.
CM is a guilty pleasure; chocolate ice cream or Giligan's Island.
Don't think about it too much just put it on and go.You will be rewarded by finding CM's influences and searching deeper for better stuff (orbital, aphex twin, the orb, g-spot, simply jeff, ruby satellite system, moby etc.
And most of it will never be heard.
There are a lot of people either way too pro/con this record.

Free from disagreement or dissent.The liner notes speak for itself.
Breakbeat, House, Downtempo, and Jazz equate to Labfunk being a well pieced together free flowing form which echoes a throwback to the 70s with plenty of funk included.
Those muted horns, driving keyboards, and garage-tinged bass lines are excellent.
This album has 1974 written all over it.
This album has an attitude to it.
Gotta have it.

For a slower version of Labfunk be sure to explore Muki's Quiet Riot album.
Gotta love it.
While I can't give it a 5-star rating, it is a super solid 4.
Herbie Hancock was one of the primary motivators behind this album and is directly credited in the liner notes.
Sweet-sounding, tuneful.

I spent too much time walking around in circles for no good reason.
The game ran fine on my machine (I have a 3Dfx card).
Its a pretty good game but it does have some negative characteristics.Pros: The level designs were great, very pretty.
This is always a plus, ha-ha.Cons: Avery Brooks didn't supply his distinctive voice to the game.
First off: I would like to give this game 3 and 1/2 stars but that is not possible.
You get to run around inside the Defiant, which was pretty cool.
You have the option to play as one of 3 characters, each character has a different series of adventures.
People and things "blows up real good"; nice damage effects.
In my opinion, some of the levels were too difficult at times.
The use of the Tricorder in the game was a neat idea.
Some of the levels turned into "find the key" adventures.
Too bad!
I'm tired of that little game plot device!
Modulating phasers; another cool idea.
You do get to explore DS9 itself.

My favorite tracks are Lapdance, Run to the Sun, Am I High, Rock Star, and Stay Together.
The only song that sounds like beastie boys (which is my favorite group) is Rock Star.
They are true pioneers.
I can play the whole cd through without stopping.
And this is coming from a big fan.
Everything else on the album kicks...
It just has a different beat to it.
I know an album is good when I can do that.
The number one track Lapdance has the same exact sound as the number three track Brain.
It does have that feel to it, but it's ok because it kicks just as much booty as So whatcha want.
So why did I give the album four stars?
In my opinion they successfully nail the combination of rock, funk, soul, and R&B.
That's about the only bad thing.
I recommend this album to anyone, and the price makes it a no-brainer that you should get the album.
...before I talk about the good there is one bad that I saw.

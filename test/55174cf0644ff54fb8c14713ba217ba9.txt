right?
"I think the cover's got it right.
sucker-sucker-sucker-suck!
Now get back in the kitchen and make me a chicken pot-pie because this 'mac-and-cheese-hold-the-mac' aint cuttin the mustard, pal.
i'm turning into sting, i'm turning into sting.
i'll sell my soul.
'cuz I'm not buying one, and henry appearantly needs the dough.
'cuz you're a sucker.
a sucker.
yeah.
i'll crank this cheese out.
'how about some new lyrics for "liar", in honor of this release: "...'cause you're a sucker.
buy two.
It's all about chicks and money (dude).if you like this album, please buy it.
I'm still waiting for the punchline: "this isn't really rollins band - April Fool's you fools - this is a coverband who usually does contemporary top 40 TRYING to sound like henry and the boys - HaHaHaaah you suckers..".This must be an IQ test for the masses - the more who buy it, the lower the average rollins listener's IQ is.
So it's all a farce, a joke, right henry?

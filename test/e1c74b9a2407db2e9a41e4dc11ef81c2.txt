Well, this was that.
It's Watchmen-Lite featuring Superman.
It's not one-star bad, but it's definitely two-star bad.And puh-lease, spare me Joss Whedon telling me how great this is.
There, I said it.
If anyone were to say it wasn't, well they're deluding themselves.
Therefore if you're ripping off Watchmen you need some guy in a stupid white hat to rape somebody.
Really dumb ending.The story is a ripoff of the Watchmen.
The Dr. Light rape scene was just really juvenile and stupid.
I get it.
Hype to sell comics.
This book came highly recommended and...I don't understand why.
Really lame story.
One complete hack congratulating another complete hack.
Watchmen had a rape.
Make's so much sense!Meltzer is good at writing narration.
If only this story wasn't so awful.And the huge anime eyes were just too much.Overrated crap.
BOOOOOO.
Garbage.
Maybe because people like really lame crap?
He makes the characters almost believable.

I have done a bit of caving, and so I bought the uncut original movie as I liked the premise.
Praise be to Netflix...
The first half of the film had real character developement and real spelunking.
You had a sense of total isolation, which of course adds greatly to the atmosphere of the film.
There are a few "unlikely" plot twists that hurt more than help.
Not a great film, but 3-1/2 to 4 stars.
scenario.
Six women go into an all but unknown/forgotten cave system.
It is a good suspenseful film.
Sound simple?
It is.
Personally, I don't feel it's worth watching, but there seem to be quite a few people that do.
As I am not a big fan of horror movies, that is a very good rating from me.
Six women went in to the cave, none came out...In Descent 2, they take an elevator.
There is no more suspense than your average "what's around the next corner?"
They run into some annoying little flesh-eaters and the obligatory blood fest begins.

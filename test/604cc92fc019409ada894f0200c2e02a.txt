That's where it belonged.My advice.
Simply DON'T BUY THIS.
It worked for about the first month, then it simply died.
The Power Tank would run the astro GPS unit, power the mount and generally contribute to the experience.
I tried a new power supply - same behaviour as described by so many others.I threw it in the trash.
Something like that.
Frustrating junk.
Every time I tried to recharge it, it simply blinked off.
If you do buy it - DON'T DEPEND ON IT.It WILL fail.
Aggravating junk.
Disappointing junk.
The work JUNK is used repeatedly in the reviews regarding this product.
Unfortunately, I got involved in other things and I did not try to revive the unit until much later.
It did none of that.
This was a gift my wife bought me when I got out my old telescope and refitted it in preparation for renewing my old astonomy hobby.
Junk captures the correct attitude one should take in assessing this, but it needs another adjective.

True it's not historically correct but who cares?!?
Everytime I watch it I get taken away to a different time and place and secretly wish I could be like her.
It's hollywood!
If only there were people out there like Marc Antony to take you away....God I love that movie!
When I watch a movie such as this, it's for entertainment.
I am a huge Cleopatra fan.
I really LOVED this movie!
Fell free, any of you to email me so we can chat about this enchanting movie!
Don't expect much of them EVER!
That I could be her!
I also admit the acting wasn't all too great either but everyone needs to remember that's partially the directors fault too.
When I watched the movie I NEVER expected them to do it right.
Oh....if only it could be.
He thought it was good enough and he could of had it changed too.
I've read almost every book about her and seen every movie about her.
From the low budget they had for this movie I thought it was excellent!

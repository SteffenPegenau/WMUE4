It works great for me!
I was lucky to get 2 hrs of uninterrupted sleep.
I do not have any side effects.
In fact, I always had restless leg syndrome and that improved drastically.
I tried it myself and purchased 5mg tablets and 1mg tablets.
For the past 5 years I have always had trouble sleeping but this past year it has been just horrible.
I actually take 10mg every evening and now I usually get 6 hrs of sleep.
Well, I found out about this when someone mentioned it about helping my dogs.
I am not sleepy at all during the day.
I have less night sweats.
Yay!
I increased my dose slowly and after 2-3 weeks, I found my dosage.
for Melatonin.
I look younger because I am actually getting sleep.
I have more energy than ever.
Both my Mom and husband have tried it and they have had horrible nightmares.
I feel great.

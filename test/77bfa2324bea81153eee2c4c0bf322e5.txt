They made a large turkey and no one ate the dark meat.
Well, a year passed and my husband and I were invited to a Christmas dinner at a friend's home.
It was then that I asked to take it home.
It was wonderful.
I purchased this book after seeing Mr. White on a Julia Child show.
I said no, but noticed he was about to throw this wonderful meat into the garbage.
Jasper White is a culinary king.
At first, I just read through it and kept promising myself I would try a recipe soon.
His recipes are tried and true and have made tasty contributions to our kitchen table.
All the recipes are great.
As we were leaving, our host asked if we wanted the dark meat and legs.
Not having a clue as to what I was going to do with it, I searched through "50 CHOWDERS" and found his recipe for turkey chowder.
I couldn't see wasting all that food.
Try this book, you won't be sorry.
I have made it over and over and tried other recipes as well.

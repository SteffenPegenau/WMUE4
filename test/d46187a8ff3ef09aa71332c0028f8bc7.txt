I disagree abou this "metal" thing.
Most of the songs aren't very good and it's boring.
They're music isn't really metal, it's more rock.
And so on(...)
The only good songs off this album.
Swamped,Heaven's a Lie,Tight Rope, Entwined and Angel's Punishment are good songs.
So that makes it 5/13, which isn't good really.
This is band is usually labled as gothic metal.
This album is sooo highly overrated it's not even funny.
Sooo much better than this Comalies.
Lacuna Coil's first album,In a Reverie, i thnk is a GREAT album.
It's boring!
!I gave this album 3 stars.
Also, Andrea sounds pretty good here, which is good.
Gothic rock is what i'll call this band, but who caresSo overall, this is OKAY, but not excellent like everyone says *rolls eyes*.I have recommendations.
But i still think they should lose him.The genre.
People are always raving about how excellent or amazing this album is and saying wonderful things, when it actually isn't that great.

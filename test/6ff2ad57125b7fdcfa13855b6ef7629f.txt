It also has no door to hold the batteries in the unit's base.
Second, it's flimsy and poorly constructed.
Save your money.
This thing would better serve as a paperweight.
Fourth, it turns twice as fast as described.
The wheels that the turntable coast on are at slightly different heights, so the table tends to "flop" slightly as it rotates.
Third, it does not support anything close to 2 pounds.
There's no way you would want to keep this display on in a room unless you were hearing-impaired or really like... barbequing.
It literally sounds like a barbeque rotisserie.
As long as it was turned off of course.
A one pound weight turns at 4 rpm, not the 2 rpm as described.
Anything over one pound taxes the motor to the point where it gets jerky.
For the price, I expected a much higher-quality product.
I used a 1.75lb weight to test it and it virtually grinds itself to a halt.
This item does not perform as described in several ways: First, it is not quiet.

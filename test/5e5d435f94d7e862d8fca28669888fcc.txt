Would you give your child a daily dose of antibiotics?
It did a great job in clearing up her tear staining.
It can irritate the digestive tract.
I don't know if Angel Eyes' had anything to do with it for sure or not.
Also after awhile, you dog develops a tolerance for antibiotics.
I know that the UK and some other countries have banned products with tylosin in them.
What if your dog develops pneumonia etc.
I will never use Angels' Eyes again.
However recently she developed Pancreatitis.
I have been giving my 16 month old blonde Havanese Angels' Eyes for a few months.
I am now researching an alternative to Angels' Eyes.
But Angel Eyes' contains an antibiotic (tylosin).
?, and the you find out that antibiotics no long work for him because his body has built an immune system against antibiotics ?
My dog is now recovering and should be ok.
But I thought about.

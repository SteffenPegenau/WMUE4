Breakaway2.
If any listener liked her first two singles, he/she will love what remains on this album.The memorable, the great, and the masterpieces...1.
Beautiful Disaster (Live) (Recycled from her 1st album...better than the original)
Walk Away9.
Behind These Hazel Eyes4.
Since U Been Gone3.
Gone6.
Where Is Your Heart8.
She broke away from her old style and its restrictions and has directed her music to a more rock, hard-driven pop style.
Having purchased her last album, I had no idea whatsoever as to what to expect from her sophomore album.
Because of You5.
Her last cd was very pop... and, sadly, it had but a few good songs.
Addicted7.
You Found Me10.
I am so pleased with this cd that it almost seems necessary to leave it in my cd player.
I was cautious to buy this album, but after hearing "Breakaway" and "Since U Been Gone", I knew there had to be something different.
I was right... this album is just as the title suggests.

They brought back my favorite contestant, Amber Brkich.
Survivor: All Stars, was the best season hands down.
If you are debating on which season to get, get All Stars.
No competition.
And All Stars was by far the best.
But this particular season was very well done.
I often don't like the seasons where they bring the Survivors back because they are all like, "I played this game once before..." "I know how this works," and blah, blah, blah.
So, always open the disk upside down and that solves one problem!
Favorite one yet!
Awesome season.
So that's all my complaints and the bonus footage is hilarious.
Order it...now!
I have seen seasons 1, 2, 6, 8, 16, 18 - 23.
They also had Boston Rob Mariano, Richard Hatch, Rob Cesternino, Alicia Calaway, and Rupert Boneham!
I have seen every episode at least 5 times!
No complaints, except for maybe that they put the order of the people voted out on the from cover of each disk.

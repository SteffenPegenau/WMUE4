I remember being at Cornerstone.
I'm only 39 but I keep opening my reviews with I remember.
We were all blown away.
Thank God for the internet and Amazon.com.
And even if it is a album that gets played once or twice a year (I am a bit older now, you can do the math if you want to know how old I was in 90,) it was time to find it on C.D.
This was a world before Logic and Pro-tools.
It was Jerome and Gyro playing Him the sketches of the songs that would end up on this record.
Even Hip-hop was still young.Any Way This album has followed me around the world, albiet in cassette form.
So I'll do it again.
This is a cassette 8 track?
What you remember or what you don't?)
I suppose that I'm getting nostalgic.
And there was a couple of young Philipino kid's playing him their 8 track demo tape.
I was sitting in Ramald Domkus's (of Scaterd Few) tent.
(What's funnier?
It was either 90 or 91.
How'd you get the samples.

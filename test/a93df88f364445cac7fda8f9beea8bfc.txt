Is it their best, well that is to be argued, I do not think so.
Everybody has been complaining about the St.Anger CD, but if you remember when Garage Days came out with Jason it was a different sound.
Oh no!
Well that is what they did here.
The Black album had songs under 5 minutes.
Lars must of got a new drumset that sounds like a cowbell, after a while it gets annoying.
I give them credit for "again" trying something different.
The good: Lars druming, James intense vocals.
It is a defintely buy and keep in the CD changer but not one of the all time greats.
Load/Reload is totally different too!
The bad: Lars drumming, James intense vocals.
There are some good tracks, there are some bad tracks.
Then Justice came out and that was different from Puppets.
James is [mad] and sounds it, but with all of his yelling there is no Kirk with his solo's...what happened there?
It is different AGAIN.

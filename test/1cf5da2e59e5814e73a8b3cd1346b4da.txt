I purchased a product, I expect it to work without having to pay for more.
I SUGGEST YOU GUYS DON'T TOO.
IT IS LIKE BURNING MONEY.
It takes forever to create a playlist with the songs on the unit.I WILL NEVER BUY AN MP3 PLAYER FROM PHILIPS AGAIN.
I am guess 1 minute per song.
What the hell is that?
The software is the worst I've ever seen.
I purchased it refurbished thinking it was a great deal at $82, but was I ever wrong.
When charging, the unit can not be turned off and that gets very annoying.
I WILL NEVER BUY A PLAYER THAT USES MUSIC MATCH JUKE BOX.
It uses Music Match Juke box.
Playlist created on Music Match can not be transfered to the unit unless you want to transfer the songs again.
The software makes me rename all my mp3 files unless I pay for the upgrade.
It takes forever to transfer songs.
The battery life lasts only about 4 hours.
This has got to be the worst mp3 that I have ever used.

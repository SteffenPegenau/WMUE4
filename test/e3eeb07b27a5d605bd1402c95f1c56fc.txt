Nora is depressed, and suicidal.
It's hard to explain this book.
This book is about Nora Doyle, and her son's Jonah and Troy.
Almost like saying if your daddy is a drug dealer, then most likely growing up in that situation, his kids will be too.
This book is about generations of crap happening to the same family.
This book is worth reading and I do recommend you read it at least once.
Although this book was dark, there's lessons to learn.
It does all fit together once you get to the end though.
The boy's have a drug dealer father, who is a total loser.
Either you love it, or you don't.
Written by Dan Chaon.
This book is kind of depressing because it seems they just can't see daylight.
I mean, some people do have a sucky life.
Also, the characters jump around so much in the book at first, it's hard to bond to any one character.
This book is full of depressing adventures that are sort of believable.

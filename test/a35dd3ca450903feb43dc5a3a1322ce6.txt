I lost my son in 2000, and guess what, they were there, and so was mom.
She and I love to sing together, hymns, mostly, but now I get to introduce two of my favorite people(s).
And I sure hope Jars is too.
Ok, I know that's silly, but mom bought my the songbook, so I couldn't wait any longer.
But if we could meet face to face, Mom would adopt every one of those guys.
So was mom.
I'm sure of it.
Mom is a mezzo-soprano,I sing Contralto.
I lost the love of my life in '99, and Jars was there.
(smiles) I hope mom is around a long time.
My very spiritually 67 yr old mother to my FAVORITE group.
But they have, unwittingly, helped my faith so many times.
(crying)I've never got to see Jars in person, and now my health is not so great.
But we mix it up.
Now you see?
Now, we get the two- through God's grace together, wow.
God bless you.

And even if someone is new to the Stones, they should hear the REAL, ORIGANINAL versions!!!

I've been a die-hard Stones fan for many years and was excited to have all these great songs in one collection.
But it's hard for me to listen to songs that I know have more to them!
Forty Licks shoulda been 3 discs, it's that simple.
.
Call me a ... music geek, but when I listen the the world's greatest Rock & Roll band, I wanna hear the songs the way they were intended to be heard!!!
Disc one is okay, but disc two, not so much!!
But be advised, many songs on the second disc are EDITED VERSIONS!!!!
Just wanna let people know; fair warning .
The new songs are real good and maybe "Dont Stop" will come out as a single; Keith's ballad is great, too!
.
The WHOLE song, not some EDITED version!!!!
I hate when they EDIT songs just so they can cram a bunch onto one disc!!!!

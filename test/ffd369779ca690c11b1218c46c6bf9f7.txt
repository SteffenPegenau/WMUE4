Ok so I've been listening to santanas song for about a minute now, nobodys singing... 2 minutes... alright getting sick of music,moving on to... JArs of Clay.
)monica's "grown up christmas list" is ok, i think it could've had better lyrics.
It's got a hip beat and cool lyrics!
ANd christina... no comment.
Dido's song sounds kind of Junkie Monkey!
AND... NO WAY, I can't BELIEVE I'm going to say this!
the bsb's song ACTUALLY sounds good.
Wow these guys have great voices!!!
I'm listening to the cd right now.
Won't even talk about steps.
The song has a good tempo too!
I think Britneys song is actually pretty good!
R.Kelly, Donell Jones(he's not exactly the best), tlc, Toni Braxton, Whitney Houston.
Normally i like n*sync, but let's face it this song STINX...HARD!
( and i hate britney!
Joe's "this christmas" is AWESOME.

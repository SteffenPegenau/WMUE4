Bye Samantha, 'bye, Cindy!
Was it a miscarriage or a stillborn baby?
And Samantha was thrown to Ireland with Tor!
So she won her maiden.
What's after that?!
I liked the story line and everything.
What happened to her?
It's like she never existed!
What a rip-off!
And whatever happened to that baby Ashleigh was expecting?
In other words, how did ten years fly by so fast?
Okay, so the book was pretty good.
Oh, and didn't Wonder have any other colts or fillies between Campion and Legacy?
They don't even mention Cindy's name!
And Honor!
And if so, WHY DIDN'T THEY TELL US?
Hello! '
But where are the ten years we missed?!

I am going to buy a bark collar instead.
I am lucky that I didn't purchase it to protect myself from big dogs.
Pay the money and spring for something a little more expensive.
When I tried it on my lab he just kept barking, and barking and barking.
I wasted 13.00 dollars on this device only for it to be of no help what so ever.
NOT!!!!!!!!!
It would have left me defenseless.
Don't waste your money on this one.
The worst part is that it only lasted for a day and a half.
I do not recommend this device to anyone.
My mother has shih-tzus and it worked on those dogs.
I bought this device for my black lab puppy who had become a nuisance barker.
I read the good reviews and thought that this would be a great investment.
Completely broken!!!
It didn't even phase him.
Now it doesnt even work.

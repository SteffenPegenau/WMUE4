I bought "Results May Vary" (the previous album) as my first Limp Bizkit album.
I loved every song on the CD.
I'm officially an ex-Limp fan.
I can't even begin to describe how dissapointed I am in this latest release.
As a newly found Limp fan, I bought this new EP at first sight.
The guitar was amazing and the unique time changes really amazed me.
Wes Borland is back with the band and his riffs sound so choppy and disorganized.
Fred Durst sang well and the melodies were extremely creative and addicting.
Fred Durst just raps his way through all the crazy out of place guitar.
No more melodic tones, no more singing.
Well, I totally wasted my money.
I thought I was a new Limp Bizkit fan.
This album stinks...soooo bad.
It sounds like they have this Rage Against the Machine influence, and it's so out of place for Limp.
I'm either selling it to a used CD store, burning it, or trashing it...just as long as I don't have to listen to it or see it again.

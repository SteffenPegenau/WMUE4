Verdade Em Paz
This 1964 album by Brazilian singer Doris Monteiro is notable for the absence of songs by Tom Jobim or any of the other lions of the then-dominant bossa nova scene.
Instead, there are several tracks from second-generation composers such as Marcos Valle (four of his songs) and Durival Ferreira.

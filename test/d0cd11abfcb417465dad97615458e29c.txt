Then after a minute they take it down and someone puts up the Iraqi flag.
End titles.
In the latrine.
Under pillows.
Behind the poster of Rita Heyworth.
Arabic music.
Up...other places.
Ooh, there are some cynics out there.
Redford winches up the American flag.
Up the inmates left trouser legs.
But the film seems longer.
The catapault was obviously hidden in pieces around the prison.
Then they constructed it in er, a minute flat and er....Will the Special Edition have an alternative ending?
Behind the cigarette vending machine.
Like it, centurion?

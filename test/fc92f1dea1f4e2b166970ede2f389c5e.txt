I droup this device multiple times and it has yet to crack.
far better than the ipod's.
at first i thought it was the headphones but later found out that it was the device.
Besides that this is a great mp3 for a great price.
the sound is amazing.
it takes about 2seconds to put a song on (very fast).
this is a great mp3 player, however it is outdated, we are now in the age of colored players.
The software is excellent.
..I had this device for 6months and the headphone jack suddenly shorted out.
just transfer them straight from your computer to the device.
No sound is coming through the headphones.
alot of people complain that it is to thick (compared to the new ipod video it is enormus).
however it is very durable.
You dont have to convert the songs to any other format.
but if none of that matters to you and if the size doesn't matter to you.
I highly reccomend this product.

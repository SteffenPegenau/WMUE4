Here is a loveable cast of characters, a little off beat, kinda crazy, but believable in a strange sort of way.
Well, you are in for a real treat, so treat yourself.
.
fan, you already know you have to have this set .
is back, and I love every minute of this show.
I haven't laughed so hard since .
Alan Spenser has created the very funniest sort of humor, because it is just one tiny step over the line from reality.
Trust me, I'm a trained professional!
so what are you waiting for.
well, since I originally viewed Sledgehammer!
This is Dirty Harry with a sense of humor, the Sargent Joe Friday they never told us about and the real answer to restoring law and order.
.
Sledgehammer!
.
It's a bargain!
If you haven't seen Sledgehammer!
back in the 80s!
.
before?
And all this goes back to a time when we could still laugh at and with ourselves; before the idea of "political correctness" stole that right away from us.If you are or were a Sledgehammer!

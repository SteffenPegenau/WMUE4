The company promptly replaced it and paid the shipping.
The pump was the main selling point for me.
The controls were balky and impossible to regulate.
Finally, a few weeks ago, it started leaking on the floor.
I have tried to contact the company but the numbers I have for it are no longer working.
The dehumidifier was apparently working, but not the pump.
I think it was an energy hog.
I would stay away from this model and this company.
The second one worked OK and pumped the water out of the tank into a laundry sink.
It simply ran on high all the time regardless of the setting.
There is no alternative way of emptying the tank.
The first one I received was DOA.
I purchased the Model AD400E with Electronic Pump #45 about two years ago.
I tried to open the cabinet to see if I could repair it, but it is not designed for easy service.
So now I have a 50-pound piece of scrap metal in my basement and the humidity is rising.

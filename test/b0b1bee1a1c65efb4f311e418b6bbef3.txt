I do realize that it was made in the late thirties, and that it would take hours and a narrator to include everything in the book, but it was still a disappointment.
It will be hard to enjoy other books when you compare them to GWTW.
<- and that is an understatement!!!
No other book can make you love and hate a character at the exact same time.
What an amazing book.
So, after reading it i just HAD to watch the movie.
It left out a lot from the book, and you didn't get to know the characters as well.
I couldn't even finish it.
You will never be the same!
But if you liked the movie, you MUST read the book.
We are studying the Civil War in my sophomore American History class, and everybody must read a book about the Civil War, so i took on the challenge of reading GWTW.
And the first four hundred pages worth of actionless descriptions are necessary in order to lay a good foundation for the greatest story ever told.
Don't be scared by the size!
Wow.
Please read this book!

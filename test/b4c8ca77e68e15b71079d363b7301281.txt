I thought the story was terrible.
I'm not sure.
A great DVD, however.
Are there any?
It's horrible.
The truth is that this movie STINKS!
Oh....right.
And the last half of the movie is like a really bad Godzilla movie.All in all, not a very good movie.
It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's pretty close to it.
I think there are.
The movie alone should get zero stars.
It's nothing even near to the original.
It's definatley on the list.
The only reason why this movie gets two stars is because of the DVD.
Just a terrible movie.
Yeah, there's a few.Picture quality is outstanding.Sound quality is very good.Great special effects.Very cool extras.Unfortinatley, that's all that's good with this movie.
In fact, I heard that the book is ten times better than the movie.
Acting wasn't that great, either.
Before we get to what's wrong with this movie, I thought it would be a nice change to go over the positives first.

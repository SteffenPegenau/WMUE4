I bought this for a few reasons.
Reason 6:AND THE WIND CRIES MARY.
Reason 3:IF 6 WAS 9.
But I'd probley given it a ful 5 stars if it had MACHINE GUN on it.
Anyone who has heard MACHINE GUN knows what I'm talking about.
To me, that's his greatest hit.This is however a good starter disc for newbie Hendrix fans.
Reason 2:ALL ALONG THE WATCH TOWER.
Reason 4:STONE FREE.
It's some of his greatest from ELECTRIC LADYLAND and ARE YOU EXPERIENCED.
Reason 1:PURPLE HAZE.
But for God's (or Jimi's) sake, don't let this be the only Hendrix CD you buy.
Reason 5:FIRE.
Because if it is, your missing out on a lot.WALKMAN2527
It's just the way Jimi makes his guitar sound like a M-60 machine gun that gets me everytime.
Reason 7:FREEDOM.This CD isn't really Jimi's greatest hits.

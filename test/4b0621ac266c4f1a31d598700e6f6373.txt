I have kept going in the thus far futile hope that something will happen.
A character who isn't straight out of central casting.
("Send us a twenty-something, Birkenstock-wearing, sexually-liberated hippie.
So she stretched.
This book's great crime is that it isn't a short story.
NOW!")
Sex key to everything!"
A conversation that ISN'T "one they will remember for the rest of their lives".
A paragraph where somebody says something or does something.It honestly feels like the author had enough material and original thought for about 30-40 pages, but needed a novel.
I am that great rarity: a man who has read this book.
Any sign of depth beyond "Women good.
Anything at all.
Well, most of this book.
Anything.
Men bad in bed.
And stretched.

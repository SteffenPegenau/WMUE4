I find listening to one or two songs deviates from the perfection that encompasses Antics.I really think that if you like Interpol, even a little bit, this album is worth owning.
It is a really excellent album.
I give it four stars.
It does not, in the least, get tiresome.
I find each band unique.
The vocals blend well with the style of music.
It is not a genius album, but wonderful anyway.
I love the style of their music, guitar driven and rythmic melodies.
It is catchy, fun, and never tedious.
Interpol is just a great band, and definitely worth checking out.I hate when they get compared to Joy Division.
I am an Interpol fan, and I like their sound.
I really like both of their albums.
I have enjoyed listening to Antics over and over.
Interpol's lyrics are eccentric, but really good.
The whole album needs to be experienced as one.

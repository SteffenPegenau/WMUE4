Talk about adding insult to injury!
in a very short amount of time.
The change sent my dog into a tail spin.
She lost 5 lbs.
After weeks of worry and meds and messes to clean plus prednisone for the scary hot spot (my vet shrieked when she saw it!)
And since she had always done so well in Canidae, I never dreamed it was the food.
Severe vomiting, diarrhea, hot spots and itching were the main symptoms.
We were very happy with our choice and I recommended this food to many people.
They made this major change without so much as a sticker slapped on the bag notifying their customers.
Not a good food for us and not a good company to deal with.
Wish I could give ZERO stars.
We switched to Canidae ALS after the tainted food scare.
Canidae's customer service rep. blamed me for not transitioning properly!
I started researching and a food change was the only thing that stopped the problems.
Then they changed the formula.

Goodkind is even copying Jordan.
It has a better story...
Read R.A. Salvatore if you want good Action-orientated Fantasy.
And he's copying it very bad.
Take a Superman-Comic and you get a much better Characterization.
Read He-Man.
Story?
Ideas?
if you want good Fantasy.
Read Williams, Martin, Tolkien etc.
Characters?
Jordan is only writing for the money, which all the Lemmings (= Readers) are giving him with a big "Thank you".
None.
Yeah, right... Don't bother with this piece of garbage.
This series of books is even worse than Wheel of Time.

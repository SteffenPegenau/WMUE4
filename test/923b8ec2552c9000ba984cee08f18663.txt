It is a shame because the album is good and he deserves to get it heard.
So when I found out that JC was finally releasing this new album I was excited.
I was glad he did it that way.
They promoted Justin like hell but they forgot about JC.
When I heard the whole album I had different feels about it.
I am sad to say that I know it probably will not even sell close to what Justin's sold.
But I do think he did a great job.
I am a huge NSYNC fan.
I still have not see his new video.
He has such a nice voice but he did not really show it off.
He is so far from NSYNC right now and you would not think it was JC when you hear the album.
It is good.
I loved Justin Timberlake's Justified album.
I have to say JC's album was pretty good.
It was very different then any other album I have ever hear.
Because the record label does not promote JC at all.
First I knew I liked it but I did not like that he did not show a lot of his vocals on a lot of the songs.
Why?

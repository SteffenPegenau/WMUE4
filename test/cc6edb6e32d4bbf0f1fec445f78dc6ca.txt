Probably not.
The overall feel of this set is one of generalities,not one area of reggae music that other box sets fulfill.
It's hard to believe that this is the 50th box set from Trojan.
each approximately.
Fifty tracks by fifty artists means many different musical styles.
As such there are a lot of surprises for both the long-time reggae lover and the uninitiated.
Made up of songs from the late sixties to the late seventies,there is a broad spectrum of artists.
44,48,52 min.
Should this be your first purchase?
Songs like Suffer Me Not to Rose Garden to It's Your Thing to Ain't That Peculiar are just some of the things you'll hear.
This particular box set was chosen by the fans of Trojan Records.
The arrangements range from typical small groups to highly arranged horn backing.
Sound is good.
This is aimed a bit toward long-time Trojan/reggae listeners.
Three discs.
That said,there is still a lot to recommend here.

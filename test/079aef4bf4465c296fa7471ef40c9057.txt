.
blows me away every time.
I highly recommend this CD!!!!
The Way is so romantic about being in love, & The Way is a very good song, especially sung by Clay.
Solitaire .
Two wonderful but different songs.
.
!
Solitaire stirs up such emotion in the listener.
Clay sings it with such emotion.
Solitaire is about love lost & is hauntingly beautiful.
words fail me but I will try.
The glory note about 3/4 of the way into Solitaire .
This CD is soooooo good!!!

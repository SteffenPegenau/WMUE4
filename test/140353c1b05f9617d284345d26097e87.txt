But don't cheat yourself.
I even had to get the "End of Days" soundtrack since it had the 'new' GnR song on it.
They are worth the money hands down.
But I'll buy it even if I'm an 80 year old lady.
Until then, I guess this will have to do.
Aside from the fact that I've been almost desperate for anything Guns...
But all the songs are great.
Waiting for "Chinese Democracy" is killing me.
But if you have all their other albums, why buy this?
This CD has nothing new which is why only four stars.
Too bad they didn't have anything new to add.
Buy "Appetite" and the "Illusions" and "Lies" if you can get a copy.
The distinctive original voice of Axl, Slash's riff's, great song writting.
I mean, I have them all, including the "Sympathy for the Devil" remake that they are using to sell this thing.
If you're new to Guns, sure start with this.
I loved GnR since I heard them for the first time.
Or at least other versions of the songs (which I can't believe I said, since I hate re-mixes!)

Hasn't this been done before!?!(i.e.
It made me hate this book!
Third, the ending!
MEG isn't a novel of deep terror...
Bum,Bum,Bummmmm!!!
A giant shark glowing deamon shark is unleashed upon the unsuspecting world.
I'll give it to Alten, he tried to make Jonas's terror of the sharks real but realistically you could predict this book like a bad summer movie.
Jaws) Let me just say, bigger is not better in this case.
I'll admit, MEG occupied my time and gave me mild amusment, but come-on!
I mean what can I say?
...First, its a takeoff of a classic book (Jaws), just enlarging the villian and down sizeing the characters.
I didn't like any of the characters, none where deep in anyway.
Don't read MEG, unless your in the mood for a bad summer movie script.
oh-no!
Arggg!
Second, like I just said the characterization is horrible!

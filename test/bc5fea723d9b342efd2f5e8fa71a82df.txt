I never finished Emily's Angel.
Deveraux should never have McNaught- erized her writing.
For Twenty-Two and a Half years I have read EVERYTHING any of the three have written.
As soon as she changed her style, her books suffered.
I LOVE your writing and if I could would do it myself.
NOBODY is that BAD, "MY LOVE",.
The story was good but it was the worst book I ever read!
I think that she is THE best Author I ever Read (before she tried to change).
I was hooked BECAUSE of these two Authors (plus Johanna Lindsey).
It was GREAT already.
Well...NOT as BAD as Cassie Edwards!
I would love to read a Deveraux book written like her early stuff.
Jude Deveraux was the next writer I tried.
I began reading Romance in 1978 with Jennifer Blake.
McNaught,Coulter,Lindsey,Robards,Blake,Roberts, are some of my favorites.
Ms. Deveraux, please, Take this as it's intended...go back to , so called "little girl sentences" , etc.

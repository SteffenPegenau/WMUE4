~Kelly
The novel primarily centres on the mother-daughter relationship and how easily it can de disrupted by both external and internal forces.Paula Sharp presents a very serious and debatable subject...abortion.
Addiction.
Paula Sharps's 'I Loved You All' offers all of the above and more.
The characters will make you laugh, understand, shake your head, and gasp!I Loved You All is set against the backdrop of the 1970's Pro Life Movement while a mother is battling an addiction and desperately trying to hold on to those she loves.
The true focus is on the development and repair of relationships not providing a forum for the Pro Life/Pro Choice debate.I encourage others to seek out this book and other titles by Sharp.
Abortion.
Understanding.
She does this with class and does not belabour the issue.

if you don't have a lot of prog music or are new to the scene, this would be as good as any place to start.
are they competent?
sure.
sadly i found them pretty average prog music.
i read some reviews about this band and decided to check them out.
sorry.
no.
sad to say, the music industry is flooded with prog bands and their sweeping symphonic sounds.
yes.
don't get me wrong, they guys are alright.
but if you're familiar with the scene and have a lot of discs already, Pallas will have nothing new to offer.
nothing but copy cats of copy cats.
but the industry is saturated with average artists.
are they good?
this is exactly what happened to the "new age" music category.
do they offer anything different, orginal or above average?

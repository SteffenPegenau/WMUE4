It was too short and ended very quickly.
I hate when a movie is ruined because of test audience opinions.
Had that been the case, we would have had a much better movie.
And the dancing wasn't dirty.
It was 85 minutes of entertainment, nothing more.
But it sure was fun.
While the story was boring, it had charm.
The story was utterly predictable and dry.
The deleted scenes in this case should have stayed because they added to the story rather than subtracted from it.
That said, there was also alot that attracted me to the film.
The cast was great and the setting was beautiful.
After the movie, I viewed the deleted scenes and realized that had they not been taken out, most of my complaints wouldn't exist.
The characters weren't fleshed out enough.
The songs were modern when the film took place in the 50s.
But I guess Havana Nights was good enough.
There are lots of things in Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights that I just did not like.

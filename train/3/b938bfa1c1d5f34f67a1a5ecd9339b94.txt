I AM DISABLED AND NEED ALOT OF PILLOWS FOR MY HEAD AND TO RISE MY LEGS.
I DON'T LIKE TO SEW.
THANK YOU D GILMORE A LITTLE DISPOINTED!!
AND TO HOLD TOGETHER LONGER.
I LIKE THE FEEL AND LOOK OF THE PILLOWS, MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT THEY ARE COMMING APART AT THE SEAMS AND ARE RIPPING.
NEED SOMETING STRONG AND SUPPORTIVE BUT CONFORTABLE.
MUST ALSO HAVE THEM TO PLACE INBETWEEN BY LEGS AT NIGHT SO MY LEGS DON'T OVER CROSS EACH OTHER.
HAD TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENTS AND SURGERY 8 TIMES.
PLEASE HELP WHOM EVER IS MAKING THESE PILLOWS.
I LIKE THE FIRMNESS OF THE PILLOW.
I PURCHASED ABOUT 16.
THEY ARE AT A GOOD PRICE.
I DO LIKE THE PILLOWS BUT NOT IF THEY ARE ALL GOING TO COME APART AFTER YOU SLEEP ON THEM FOR TWO DAYS.
PLEASE HELP MAKE THEM HOLD TOGETHER BETTER.
I HOPE THAT ALL OF THE PILLOWS ARE NOT GOING TO DO THE SAME THING.
THEY DO FEEL VERY CONFORTABLE TO SLEEP ON.
!
I AM HAVING TO SEW THEM BACK TOGETHER.

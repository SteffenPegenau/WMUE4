He goes to a country of people that are only six inches tall.
He starts to want to be a Houyhnhm.
This occurs in book two.
Gulliver, the main character, takes many trips to different islands, where he learns the viewpoints of other people, on him and his country.
He is really just Swift's mouthpiece.
He does not really interact with people like he did in the other books.
In book four Gulliver meets the horse like Houyhnhms.
He begins to think that they can do no wrong.
He tells them about how his government works and they compare each other's.
All in all this is a pretty good book and everyone should read it sometime.
The next stop for him is on an island of giants where he finds a better government than his.
Gulliver's Travels is a great book with many adventures.
Gulliver thinks that his is the ideal government after this.
In book three Gulliver is brought to a floating island.
He soon learns that they are very corrupt individuals.
He is actually kind of embarrassed of his government.

Yes, I said it.
Gangsta Boo, in my opinion, can out rap Jean.
As a rapper.
I expected alot more from here.
I recommend Gangsta Boo (Both Worlds *69) to this CD.
Sorry, Jean.
But, it sounds like she is just reading poetry.
She doesn't really flow with the music.
You're beautiful as is your poetic vision, but I don't think rap is your fotre'.
I disagree with the Amazon.com review, Gangsta Boo does not have her dumbed down lyrics.
Basically it's just like her reading poetry over lame beats.
It just sounds akward.
I would much rather enjoy reading your lyrics than hearing them.
Her words are amazing and poetic, but am I supposed to believe she is hard-core?
Dare I say it... it sounds akward for both the listener and Jean?
However, as a poet, her words are beautiful and clever.
I mean, Jean would sit down and cry the way Boo would rip her a new one.

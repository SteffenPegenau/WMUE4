Did Nas really call Jay a "Tae Bo H o"?
Did Nas really make fun of Jay Z's facial hair?
There are a few highlights on the CD.
Hmm..Jay was right, you are lame.
"Rewind" just comes off as way too forced.
For example, the first single "Got yourself a Gun" is hot as is the Large Professor aided "You're the Man", but there is so much fluff on this album.
The winner, hands down, is Jigga.
...
Where should I start?
How about "Ether".
Did Nas really use sophomoric antics and call Jay Z G ay Z?
Other weak tracks include "Braveheart Party"--less said the better.
Let's face facts..Jay Z wins.
Also, lets not forget Nas' remake of the Tears for Fears 80's pop song "Everybody wants to Rule the World".
As you can see there is a lot of filler and disappointing material on this album.
Stillmatic is just a mediocre album.
Another weak song is the weak uninspired, Momento rip off, "Rewind".

What I like about Shiva Rea dvds is that you get challenging poses as well as easy poses all on one dvd.
So if you have been practicing yoga for awhile, skip this one and try the intermediate dvd.
Micheline Berry is a student of Shiva Rea.
But she isn't Shiva Rea and something was missing for me in this dvd.
This dvd is really, trully for beginners.
How do I know that?
We can only hope!
I kept waiting for her to let loose with free style movement the way Shiva does in her Flow dvd.
I'm spoiled.
What I love about Shiva Rea yoga flow is that it is like a dance and I love the creative combination of dance and yoga.
Nothing to grow into..so I returned it.
She even uses Shiva's phrases.
Well you can hear it in the way she explains the poses.
After viewing it once and doing it twice, I was bored.
Perhaps the intermediate dvd will have more free form movement and creativity.

LH can produce wonderfully violent works with action driven plots.
And frankly the sex seems excessive.
.
It's almost sex.
One 'filler' or bridge book is ok, but two?
So now I'm waiting for the Harliquin to come out and hoping that there's more plot development along with the sex.
Why can't we have sex and some plot development?
.
.sex.
At what point does the sex become obligatory?
But lately its just sex and more sex and some more sex in both of her series.
.100 pages.
Two is just ridiculous.
Most people I know read LH for the plot not for the sex.
I know Merry's a sex diety, but really!As far as I'm concerned Stroke of Midnight and Mistral's Kiss should have been one book.
100 pages.

And why can't they write decent instructions that make sense and use correct English.
I've had only one problem with it, and it is a big problem.
When trying to interpret the instructions in order to turn off the backlight, I ended up entering calibration mode.
There is no way of exiting "calibration mode" once you are in it.
They are not accurate, and so my scale will never be accurate.
This scale seems to operate very well.
That would be step number one for the manufacturer.
You will need to locate some weights and reset the scale.
The instructions are poorly written, obviously written overseas.
unless I find some accurate 10 Kg and 20 Kg weights.
I did the best I could with the weights I had at my house for weightlifting.
FOREVER.
Why can't they have an "exit calibration mode" option.
Why should I have to go to all the trouble to find or buy these weights?
To correct this, one would need an accurate 10 Kg and 20 Kg weight.

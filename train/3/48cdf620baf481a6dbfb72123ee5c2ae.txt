They emailed me version 4 and the unlock code.
Excellent dictionary.
I bought this because my old CD, American Heritage, got damaged when my disk drive went.
However, had I known that there was no pronunciation, I would not have bought it.
Unfortunately, as soon as I type in a single letter, the program crashes.
American Heritage did this years ago.
They told me that the CD in the dictionary was version 3, and version 4 has pronunciation.
This is for programmers working for a dictionary company!I gave it 3 stars, as it is a good dictionary.
It is useless.
I am sure the programmers there are cheap Indian programmers, unable to write a simple code for pronunciation.
Merriam-Webster does not have pronunciation.
It does not pay to return the item.
I corresponded back and forth, with no success.
I emailed the company.
The whole thing is on a CD.
In their email correspondence, they did not even know proper English.

7/10WWF Lightheavyweight TitleTaka Michinoku (C) vs PanteraVery entertaining.
But very entertaining nonetheless.
Great Match.
8/10Stone Cold, Owen Hart, Cactus Jack, Chainsaw Charlie vs DX and Savio VegaThis should never had been a main event on a PPV.
9/10WWF No Way Out 1998 is just a buildup PPV to WWF Wrestlemania XIV.
8/10Mask MatchVader vs Kane w/Paul BearerGood match.
8/10NWA North American TitleJeff Jarrett (C) w/Jim Cornette vs BradshawPretty boring.
6/10The Quebecers ve The GodwinnsVery boring.
Not worth your money unless you are a hardcore wrestling fan.
The Headbangers vs Goldust w/Luna Vachon and Marc Mero w/SablePretty good opening match.
Tad bit long though.
You might wanna fast forward through this.
4/10Ken Shamrock, Ahmed Johnson, and DOA vs Nation of DominationPretty entertaining.
6/10
Some high spots.
One of the best on the tape.
But worth watching.

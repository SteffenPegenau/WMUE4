There is someone out there that should be able to fix it.
The problem with mine was the compressor went out.
I found a guy that does commercial refrigeration and he said he could fix it.
If you have no cooling, check around.
It cost me $160.
I had my Skybox for about a year before it stopped getting cold anymore.
One in the top tray and one in the bottom tray to move the air better and stop the heat build up.
I was told these compressors are a common compressor used in quite a few different machines.
They are easy to get.
The guy replaced the compressor and added two more fans.
I was told it is of poor design (internally).
The sides of my Skybox would get pretty hot.
to get this done.
The heat, I am told, burned out the compressor.
I bought the Skybox for a low price when they were being discontinued so I think I'm still ahead of the game.
I was told by many appliances places that they would not touch the Skybox.

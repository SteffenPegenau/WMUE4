If you have the extra to spend, get the Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000.
If not, and you are like me, this one will do the job, but don't expect it to be that great.
It is grainy, and VERY slow... i look like I am moving in slow motion ALL the time.
I should do a video review using the cam, but you'd not be able to see me very well.
No lag time or anything.
It has an earbud with a mic on the cord.
Bright light, such as sunlight, in front of you helps with clarity a bit.
This is not worth the money.
My daughter's webcam is fantastic!
It is super clear and like watching TV.
Spend the extra and get the next step up.
There is not any microphone, but does come with a mini headset of sorts.
I've not tried that as my laptop has a microphone.
I bought this to chat with my daughter and some friends.
The webcam was easy to install, no issues with Skype (which is what I bought it for), and it works fine on my laptop.

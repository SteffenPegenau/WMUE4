The field of view is somewhat limited but not pipelike.
The image clarity in the center of the field was quite good but field curvature reduced it substantially starting about one third out toward the edges.
The binoculars seemed a little heavy for their size but had a solid feel.
The parallax alignment seems to be good.
If I do we will see how they hold up.
The optics are about average or a little better for inexpensive binoculars ($35).
I give you here my first impressions.
I haven't decided whether to keep them.
The long eye relief seems to work well with glasses.
I received the Celestron Outland 8x21 compact binoculars today from Amazon.
The focus worked smothly.
Other than that, they were unspectacular in this price range.
The diopter setting is off zero by a wide margin.
The best feature was the eye relief.
The rubber around the right eye lens was not fitted properly and probably would not be water tight.

Every one of the pieces is satisfying and has something to offer.
I actually give it 3.5 stars.
I'm glad that I got Themes because it really is quite impressive.
I recommend it.
"Chung Kuo" emanates wonder and mystery and sports attractive keyboard textures.
He is the composer, arranger, and producer.
Vangelis plays all of the instruments himself, and his keyboard work is very good, indeed.
Both of these tracks are infectious, beautiful, and imaginative.
I really enjoy listening to this collection from time to time.
"Love Theme from 'Bladerunner'" is an emotional and enjoyable track, also.
All fourteen tracks are keyboard-based instrumentals.
It's quite ambient and relaxing.
I'm very impressed with two of them.
"Chung Kuo" and "Love Theme from 'Bladerunner'" are great pieces.
I got Themes a few months ago in order to acquire a comprehensive taste of his music.
Vangelis is a very good musician.

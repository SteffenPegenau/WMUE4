Not I am getting ready to buy a Brother.
What I usually do is just print my letter head on my Brother fax so it's straight.
I print large jobs.
I bought this because I LOVED my old LaserJet Series II.
I have three problems with this printer:1.
I like my Brother fax so much, hence I am going to by a Brother 9700 multifunction to replace this.Yes, the print quality is great.
I imagine if I spent more money on a higher end model, it would solve my problems, but I fortunately don't have to.
If I print onto my letterhead which has horizontal lines, it's crooked.
And there is no way to get it to line up without several trial and erros.
I haven't had the luck others seem to have had.
Paper curl.
Runs VERY hot, which probably contributes to the curling.3.
It will spit pages off the top on large jobs sometimes and not other times.
Not straight.
I don't want to have to watch it.2.
Those I also print on my fax.
Also, same problem with lining up labels.

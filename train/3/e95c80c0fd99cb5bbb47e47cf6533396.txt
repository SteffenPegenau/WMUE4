It is right in the area where the dog would sleep.
Sure enough they had the same molding on the bottom center.
The salesperson said that people just buy a cushion to cover it.
I called Petmate and mentioned it to them so I hope they took note of it.
That would be fine if I did not raise puppies.
Overall the Vari Kennel Ultra gets a thumbs up.
It's well built and a good value for the price.
Till they are done teething they would probably eat a cushion a night!
I think it saves them money to mold the top and bottom the same.
I went to a neighborhood petmart where they had more of the kennels.
My one complaint is that they have a couple of bumps molded into the center of the bottom of the kennel.
I love the Petmate Kennels.
When I received the first one, I thought perhaps it was a factory second.
It almost looked like a molding for a handle which should not be on the bottom of the crate.
We are hobby breeders and our dogs are trained to sleep in them at night.

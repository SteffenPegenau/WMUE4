The sound quality is okay.
I don't need cool and sleak, I need a cordless that works well and feels good.
So, in retrospect, would I buy this again?
I'm going to rave a bit less.
No.
But I'd give it a B.
I suspect they made this smaller to look cooler and sleeker.
It just isn't as good as my old cordless that finally died.
Not bad.
Yes it works, and yes it's not terribly expensive.
I haven't had any other problems with it, but hey, if the sound isn't perfect and it doesn't feel 100% great on my ear, then those are big negatives in my book for a phone.
Also, it's not terribly comfortable on my ear, it's as if the earpiece is too small or something.
Again, the old phone was more comfy.
Not stellar.
I read the reviews for this on Consumer Reports and they raved about it.
So I can live with this phone fine - but love it?
This phone hasn't changed that impression by much.
I've looked at cordless phones for a while and had the growing sense that they're all kind of cheap.
Not so much.

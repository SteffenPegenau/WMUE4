I am disappointed in that it is not what I sought but it was worth watching.This is worth the money especially if you enjoy brilliant nature footage.
I wanted to LEARN something.
Be prepared to wish you had some explanations to go with them.
I only wish there was some narration to go with it.This is a GOOD film.
The images are superb.
It is worth watching for its own sake.
For what it is, I would give it 5 stars.
For what I wanted, I give it 2.
Indeed, there is almost no narration at all.
I was disappointed at first.
I was expecting a nature documentary.
The videography is first rate and engrossing to watch.
Be prepared to be engrossed by the images.
Think mainly in terms of bugs.That being said, it is still a stunning achievement.
The film is simply a montage of nature video focusing on things that are generally too small for most people to notice.
I am listing it as 3.
Shortly into the film, however, I realized that learning was not the purpose of this production.

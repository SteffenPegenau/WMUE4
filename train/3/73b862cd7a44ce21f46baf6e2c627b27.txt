The Number of the Beast has the title track and Run to the Hills, both here, but Hallowed Be Thy Name is just as essential, and it's missing.
Get Best of the Beast (2 cd version).
This isn't a bad collection.
Ed Hunter's better than this too.
Space has to be considered, I know, but Powerslave and Rime of the Ancient Mariner should be here.
Better yet, get all of their albums, these guys couldn't make a bad album if they tried.
Why not include Mariner instead of Sign of the Cross?
It's getting a bit older now, so it doesn't include any of their last 3 studio albums, but it's still much better.
Edward the Great is pure garbage.
It's a much better song.
But I'm not sure how they can consider it essential since 95% of the time it sticks to a rigid 2 song representation from each album.
Can I Play With Madness is definitely essential but missing.
Only their first album gets more than 2 tracks, but Sanctuary is still missing.
Many times this just doesn't work.
Wildest Dreams should be here too.

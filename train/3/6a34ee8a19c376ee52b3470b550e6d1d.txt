I've been dying my hair for a decade in salons and at home.
Not worth it.
So, if you are allergic, this product won't help.
However, my hair was all one flat color of black.
My gray was completely covered, and remained so (even 4 weeks later).
I've used every conceivable brand and decided to try this more "natural" brand.
First of all, it still has the dreaded ppd, which is the bad chemical in hair dye.
My hair was also more fuzzy and coarse than with other box colors.Wanted to like it, but can't.
It's a poor cousin to the more expensive mass market colors.
I had tinted lather in my shampoo for days afterward.
Flat color, more damaged hair and the same dangerous chemical.
I echo the other reviewer in saying that the color was extremely hard to remove.
On the plus side, It doesn't smell strongly and is easy to apply.
My hair is mostly gray, but started out black.
Oh, and it costs more.

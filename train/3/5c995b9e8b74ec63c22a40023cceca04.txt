In the book "Unfinished Symphony", on page 80, Spike talks about taking Melody to see Grauman's Chinese Theater.
I've seen other reviews that describe Melody as a girl of the 1990s.
Maybe not even if "Melody" took place in the 90s.
Was it the 60s?
Nobody talks like that in the 90s.
However, on page 130 (in the paperback version), there was reference to The Beatles.
It was no longer called that in the 1990s.
On page 205, Adam Jackson tells Melody how all the other girls talk, saying everything is "groovy".
Who knows?
Although I did enjoy reading this book, I didn't give it any more stars because I found the timeline rather confusing.
The 90s?
This book takes place during the 1960s?
If the ghost writer was trying to convey that "Melody" took place during the 60s, then he screwed up majorly in writing "Olivia".
Melody's "grandmother" wouldn't have been watching TV as a teenager.
It had been changed to Mann's Chinese theater by then.

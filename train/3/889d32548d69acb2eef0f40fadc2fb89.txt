Why call Richard a Wizard?
This is telling a five or six book story in eleven books.
If this wasn't the next to last book, I'd be done.
Pretty much nothing was accomplished in this book!
All we get are hundreds of pages about how bad things are getting.
Now let's waste a dozen or two pages on a philosophy lesson.
It all ends back where we started.
He hasn't used any magic in, how many books?
I think ol'Terry is just stretching this out to sell more books.
Its either stolen, there are various bad things waiting to pounce if he uses it, he's forgotten he has it, someone he loves will be harmed if he does, a piece of jewelry stops him from using it.......blah blah.
THINGS ARE BLEAK!
Ooops someone got kidnapped again, then they escape.
OK, WE GOT IT!
With all the powers stacked against them, it might be nice if all the powerful good guys weren't alway hobbled by this and that so they can't fight back.
Ooops we lost something important, there we found it again.

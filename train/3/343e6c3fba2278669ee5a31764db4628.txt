It will turn you on to a whole other series filled with magic and action.
I wasn't to impressed with The Feild Guide or Lucindas secret.
The Iron Wood Tree and The Seing Stone are good too.
Spiderwick would be suitable for age eight and up.
But the Feild Guide was good enough to turn me on to this series and I'm sure it'll be the same for many others to come.
It May do the same for you.
Want a book that doesn't take forever to get to the good stuff.
Either way Spiderwick is great and has turned me into lover of books.
My favorite was the action packed Wrath of Mulgrath.
If you want better books with a touch of the super natural read Deltora Quest Forests Of Silence.
Neither Of these are for little kids.
This is a good book sereies.
Deltora is suitable for ten and up.
It is very short and easy.
Read this.
You could a volume of it in at the most an hour.

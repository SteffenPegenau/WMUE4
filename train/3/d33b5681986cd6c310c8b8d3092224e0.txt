Also, Victoria getting kids to singa song, would that ever happen?
I mean she's all like "I will NOT tell anyone about Victoria teasing me" that's a big No-No.
I also thought the middle school book was an all time low.
I mean, isn't she not supposed to.
Not a best for Anne Mazer.
SHE WAS WEARING EARRINGS!
I mean first of all, what was up with Hannah in the cover and yearbook.
They got all upset (Which they should have, Abby broke a rule) and then they made her do some community service, and Hannah is probaly gonna help out.
And I also think her parents were too light on the punishment.
If someone used that all the time like her, they would be the one being teased!
If your getting teased you should tell someone about it.
Hell no!
All in all, I'd say a thumbs down.
And getting your ears pierced without permision... that won't change anything, just get your parents angry with you.
I thought this was an okay book.
Also she gos "Like" to much.

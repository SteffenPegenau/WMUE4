I am a Marvel fan from back in the day.
I haven't seen any of that in the cartoons.
Like, Hulk vs Wolverine and Thor.
They really need to take notes from the Justice League (awesome).
This one is good but they need to step it up a bit if they want to catch up with dc animation.
If your going to be simple give me alot of action.
Anyway, Hulk vs Thor looks like I may get my wish.
This one is like an appetizer.
Bring the old Marvel back.
I'm looking forward to the new animated features from Marvel.
Marvel should be breathing life into there characters.
This is okay.
This one is very predictable and simple.
I hope they do more avengers, but build up the originals first.
I remember reading books when Thor would go off and start yelling,screaming and thunder pops off and it was like ... yeah!

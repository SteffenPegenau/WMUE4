Nope.
I just got my V-MODA Bass Freq earbuds and tried them out using my iPod.
Very clear, crisp sound.
Tried them all and small was the only one that fit.
So I bet you think I have the wrong size silicone covers.
It is quite annoying.
I suppose if you jam these suckers into your ear canal they may not move, but that is not an option.
I've never had a problem before.
This is fabulous!
Most outer noise is completely blocked out.
No my ears are not excessively small.
However, as I sit here not moving much the earbuds keep slowly slipping out of my ears.
I was hoping from all the reviews to love these, but alas I cannot if they do not stay in my ears.
I am not sure what the outcome will be when I walk tonight and sweat while using these.
Listening to music or spoken word (book on tape) the sound is REALLY good.

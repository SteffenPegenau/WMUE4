I would recommend this singular video hands down.
Uh... it really depends on what you want.
If you're wanting to work out to try to get toned, #2 is great.
I gave this set 3 stars simply for video #2.
If I could, I would go back and just buy that one.
I have been using Turbo Jam for my aerobics, and I was looking for a set of dvds with the same uptempo workout to substitute for the days I want a change.
She's not overly sexual, so it's not uncomfortable watching her and learning the moves.
You may pick up a few moves to add to your repritoire, but that's about it.Now, the videos might suck, but Carmen is a good teacher and motivator.
For me, no.
I found the strip routines as a whole, short and boring.
I felt this all day and the next.
The rest of them... eh.
There is no comparison.
There are a lot of isometrics.
They were ok.
There was no question that I was so excited to get this set.
The question is is it worth it?

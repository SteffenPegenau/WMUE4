Ignore the naysayers.
His warm, amazing voice is in fine form here.
The last two songs are a little dark and somber.
It may not have chart climbing songs like previous efforts, but that does not mean a single thing.
The song "Just Like Love" is a classic Cetera song.
Plus, a good number of them are also longer than most songs he's done.
He sounds incredible.
This is the strongest album he's done since "World Falling Down".
I don't know know where they came up with that one.
This new Peter Cetera CD is a warm and wonderful delight from start to finish.
The album hasn't been shelved either.
As for the other reviews on this page, I have to say "Please!".
"Rule The World", with it's big power ballad opening, falls into that category as well.
A mild tempo delight.
If you are a Cetera fan, you will eat this one up.
It's the best song he's done in a while.
The negative reviews are as wrong as can be.
The songs all sound more polished than previous albums.

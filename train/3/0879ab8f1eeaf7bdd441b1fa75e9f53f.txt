WAY TOO MANY!!
There are so many effects in this DVD that you are almost yelling at your television to just show the band playing.
However, if this DVD had focused on the band the music and the lighting of the stage, it would have been perfect.
Fade in and out effects.
It has spanned the years bringing music of the future to the times of today.
I will still watch this DVD.
This DVD is proof of just how GREAT their music is.
The music of Yes as we all know is endless.
Someone, must have been just introduced to the special effects buttons.
In the Revealing Science of God, it is evident that this is going on.
I am and always will be a Yes fan.
Sparkle effects slow motion effects.
I wish it had been filmed more like The House of Yes show, where you can focus on each band member.
There are water effects(LOTS) and spinning effects.
Another interesting thing is it appears that there must be a group of singers off stage helping the band.

I love the Sketcher brand.
I was a little shocked when I opened up the box.
I own several shoes under this brand name.
Now that I know these are pastel, I can kind of see it in the photo.
They are a tiny bit bigger than they should be.
That's the only place you see color on the white/multi shoe.
I do like the shoes.
I did pick white/multi.
I've already received compliments on them.
However, the picture that populates when you select that color was poorly taken.
I probably should have ordered a 1/2 size smaller.
However, the pastel is so not me.
BTW... each velcro (there are 4) strip is a different color.
Just right for the price.
I quickly logged onto my order page and double checked what I selected.
I thought I ordered white and these were white and pastel colored.
I just make sure I wear longer jeans when I wear these shoes.
Not much, with a thicker pair of socks I'll be okay.
The style is cool and they are very lightweight.

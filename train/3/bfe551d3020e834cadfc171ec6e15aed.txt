The sufferings were simply portrayed as too unbelievable.
I am a Christian and a Catholic but my faith is not solely based on passion and sufferings.
I know very well that Christ died for me in such unmeasurable pain.
If it cannot be 100% true, then it is still a lie- a Hollywood flick.
What's the basis?
Any human subject to that kind of punishment will die sooner from loss of blood, broken bones, and other internal organ damages.
Some members of the Catholic Church said that it was the closest thing to the truth.
We must remember that Christ was 100 % human during that time and subject to physical limitations of a human being.
What's unrealistic is the way the punishment was portrayed- too harsh for a human to endure, I mean physically.
Sure.
Simply put, the movie is overly exaggerated.
it looked like you can squeeze it and get a gallon of blood.
Didn't you see how Mary the mother's towel get soaked in so much blood?
But do I really need to see it in a gory kind of way?
What truth?

The spirited "Try" exhibits a nice intro and cool keyboard playing from Leigh.
The keyboarding--provided by James Leigh--is pleasing.
The sleek "I Will Be You" furnishes a gratifying intro keyboard melody from Leigh and a refrain that is atmospheric and pretty.
It sports ten tracks--one of these being a cover of "Funkytown" by Lipps Inc.
Love an Adventure is the second full-length album from Pseudo Echo.
Love an Adventure is recommendable.
The material is in a pop rock musical direction.
My favorite songs are "Try," "I Will Be You," and "Lonely Without You."
A nice mixture of guitar/keyboard work is displayed.
Brian Canham's vocals are smooth and likeable.
It was released in 1987.
The CD insert includes the song lyrics.
The plaintive "Lonely Without You" features an attractive chorus.
The disc is almost 43 minutes.
Overall, the songwriting is solid, the musicianship is tight, and the sound quality is satisfying.

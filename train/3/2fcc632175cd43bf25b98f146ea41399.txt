A spunky song that's playful.
The first time I heard Passenger Seat, I was hooked!
I had to wait to even put this on my Amazon.com wish list!
This group is very talented, but 80% of the material on the CD doesn't reflect that fact.Bottom line: Since Passenger Seat won't be released as a CD single, invest in this CD.
How could a group that recorded Passenger Seat record the balance of these songs?
I'm puzzled by that.
Great lyrics and pleasing melody.
This is the best song on the CD and has endless replayability.
5 4 3 2 Run was my next favorite.
What a brilliant song and video.
Well, finally the day came and here's the scoop:Passenger Seat wins!
Woman's Work was my next favorite.
I'm glad I did, but only a few tracks will see the laser on a repeat basis.
Sadly, the rest of the CD was very ordinary.
It deals with a woman on the edge and on the verge.

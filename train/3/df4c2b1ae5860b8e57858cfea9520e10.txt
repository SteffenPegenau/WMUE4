Joshua Leonard was a decent Clark, though his wimpiness did grate my nerves!
His Dr. Frank is both nefarious and mysterious.
She adds a nice twist in the plot.
Jordan Ladd is not only a hottie, but also a good actress.
Lance Henriksen is always a treat to watch!
Thankfully, he redeems himself at the end.
Her Nurse Hendricks character was wicked and f-u-n!
Still, I did like the basic storyline, and some of the characters were quite original.
It has great atmosphere throughout, yet spoils some of it by being so hokey in spots!
Ok, MADHOUSE is a confounding movie to me.
I was shocked to see her bumped off so quickly!
The ghostly kid is lame, especially when he goes floating past the windows!
My biggest complaint about MADHOUSE is the lack of screen-time for Dendrie Taylor!
What a waste!
Oh well, that's my take on it anyway...

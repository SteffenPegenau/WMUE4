peace.
The camera is decent but the video sucks.
Bad quality and only fifteen seconds of video.
When it works.
Stick with just the polyphonic.
I have been happy with its features but not very reliable go with a differnt phone like a moto razar much nicer.
Overall a good phone.
The menus are one of the easiest to use you will find.
Very user freindly and easy to use shortcuts are a plus.
Im on the third one now.
The ringers are of a decent calibur but not great by any means.
Very bad real music tones.
Sprint leaves a bad taste in my mouth switching to cingular.
The thing keeps going bad and i have to keep getting new ones from sprint.
The screen has good resolution.

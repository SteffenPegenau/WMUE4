A director i like .
That wore off though and it just got gross .
A setting i liked .
Too much carnage and killing though .
Perhaps i'm getting too long in the tooth ?
Lot of actors (Shue , Rhames , O'Connell , Lloyd , Dreyfuss) approximately my age .
This looked like a good one for me .
I'm certain it was all meant to be darkly funny ?
Lots of things appealed to me .
There's more than one way to scare a cat .
i've seen a lot of gnarly as of late and it's gettin' kinda stale .
Too much killing shown .
Too bad , because my old , kinda husky self was diggin' the proceedings .
Seemed like too much of a gnarly thing to these eyes .
Lots of beautiful young women doing wild things .

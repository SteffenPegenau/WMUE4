Maybe watch once and then move on.
Passable to good acting in the Long Riders.
It seemed to lack grit.
I think a better rendition of the story of Jesse James and the Younger brothers was in the movie "The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid" made in 1972 as a television film (I believe).
I found it difficult to believe David Carradine as Cole Younger.
Investigate the 1972 version with Duvall.
Not a movie you would want to repeat several times in your lifetime.
I saw this movie for the first time a couple of days ago.
Cliff Robertson as Cole Younger and Robert Duvall as Jesse James seemed to be better renditions.
What hit me about the movie was the amount of music played in the movie.
Just rent it.....and if you really like the movie.....definitely buy it.
The Long Riders is well made, but it seems to be missing something.
The cinematography is fine.
Frank Keach was good as Jesse James, but brother Stacy Keach was passable as Frank James.
The movie is fair.

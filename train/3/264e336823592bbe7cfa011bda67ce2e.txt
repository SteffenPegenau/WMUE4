I am an open-minded skeptic, but it manages to frighten me everytime!
It actually RUINS the experience in my opinion.
Oh I heard it!
Wait was that music from the show?"
I love the main ghosthunters, they are a wonderful group of people and it's great how they react towards their experiences.
but watch it with an open-mind and you will be thrilled.My favorite episode was the St. Augustine lighthouse investigation which is on this dvd.My only complaint is the sound quality isn't all that great.Also, I have issues with little "sound effects" the editors felt like they needed to add to the experience.
But as of now 3 stars.
I love TAPS.
I know a lot of people say a lot of things, that they are fake - or their facts aren't straight.
It is very realistic.
It's like "I don't hear anything.
.

This is actual ghost encounters.
Change those flaws, and you got yourself a 5 star dvd.
This goes beyond ghost movies/tv shows.

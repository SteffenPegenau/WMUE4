I know what your saying, "Maybe it was a natural discoloration.
In the future I'll stick to the ones I slide my feet in.
No it was sticky.
Funny thing is I own a pair of these same boots.
That is until further inspection I noticed there was a stain on the boot.
I fixed it and decided to try them out for a day.
After inspecting the boots further I noticed one of the buttons was hanging on by a thread.
They even secured the other button that I didn't know was loose.
Cost me $4.
They are a nice but.
Got them for Christmas from my sister.
Ended up having to take those to a tailor to fix.
Long story short I sent them back.
When I opened the box I was excited.
Well I got halfway through work and didn't realize one of the buttons came off.
I did have a problem with the buttons being loose on those as well.
Before leaving that morning I checked to make sure the others were okay.

Also, I heard from my classmates that this book isn't as Mac-friendly as they had expected.
For example, the text in front of me says the following:"Save the changes to this page and leave it open for the next exercise.
And even lamer, on the next page it says:"The document ... should still be open.
If not, go ahead and open it now.
Please.
I totally agree with the post here titled "Cutesy and Wordy."
"It's full of stuff like that, which I don't really want from a book.But if you can tolerate that, I think it's a pretty good book overall.
But the Author is really annoying.
The book itself is pretty good.
I happen to like the H.O.T.
(Hands On Training) Series.
I did find several mistakes that slowed me down a bit, but if you're intelligent enough to realize that there might be mistakes, you shouldn't have too many problems.
The text is littered with winking smileys.
I will wait right here.
;-)"Lame.

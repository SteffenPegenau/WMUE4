I was really disappointed -- partially my own fault -- because I bought this album after seeing the CMT "Crossroads" TV show with these two.
.
.
.
And Ricky Skaggs .
.
Don't get me wrong the record is a good one, but I wish the producers had put the good songs from the TV show on the CD.
I like them both.
But the TV show ran a setlist with "The Way It Is" and "Uncle Ben" and "Old Valley Road," and the versions of those songs were great .
I didn't read the song listing before I bought, and those songs aren't on the CD.
I bought the CD so I wouldn't have to watch that TV show to hear the songs.
I can't think of any reason not to.
Bruce Hornsby's solo work is incredibly strong, and his piano playing with the post-Grateful Dead band, The Other Ones, made me like him even more.
.
.BUT .
anyone who likes bluegrass like Ricky Skaggs.

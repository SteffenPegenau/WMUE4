Since Amazon hasn't listed the performers, here they are (by track numbers) : 1.
Not the strongest title in this series, the music on this CD is a bit too frenetic for background music, too obscure for casual fans of Latin exotica.
John Buzon Trio, 8.
Spectacular cover, by the way.
Richard Hayman, 11.
Hugo Montenegro, 13.
This CD is certainly enjoyable in measured doses, but 14 straight tracks of ping-ponging stereo bongos and timbales can be a bit wearing.

I would have liked to have known more about the salts than just their names.
I also would have liked to have some of them finer ground.
It goes really well with some things.
It tasted awful.
Eurasian Black Salt isn't black.
Pure ocean salt it no surprise either.
It's also a good salt.
I have had Himalayan Pink salt before, so no surprises there.
The smoked salt was as a good surprise.
I've had Sel De Guerande before, so no surprise there either.
They make the food gritty.As for the salts themselves.
More like sand colored.
It was a pleasant surprise.
I haven't had Hawaiian Red salt before.
I'm at a loss as to what to do with salt that has huge grains.
A good salt.

IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY USED A CASSETTE TO RECORD THIS ON CD.
SHOW ME THE WAY DID NOT SOUND AS GREAT.
BUT NOT BAD.
BUT AFTER THAT IT WAS OK.
OUT-OF-PRINT THOUGH.
IT WAS TAKEN FROM DIFFERENT CONCERTS.
I GOT THE MOBILE FADELITY SOUND RECORDING OF THIS ALBUM AND THE CROWD SOUNDS LIKE THERE INSIDE A BULIDING INSTEAD OF OUTDOORS.
ONE SONG HE HATED TO DO IS (DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE DO).
BUT IT IS NOT FAKE.
THIS ALBUM COULD HAVE HAD MORE ATTENTION TO IT.
THEM ARE MY TOP SONGS.
I WENT TO A PETER FRAMPTON CONCERT IN 1997.
IT'S OUTSTANDING THE ONE TO OWN.
THIS ONE REVIEW SAID SHE SAWE IT LIVE.
I LIKE, I WANNA GO TO THE SUN, I'LL GIVE YOU MONEY, LINES ON MY FACE AND DO YOU FEEL LIKE WE DO.
THE FIRST 2 SONGS YOU'LL NOTICE DROP OUTS.
A LITTLE RUSTY.
THAT IS THE MOST REQUESTED SONG AT EVERY CONCERT.
IT WAS NOT ALL RECORDED IN ONE PLACE.

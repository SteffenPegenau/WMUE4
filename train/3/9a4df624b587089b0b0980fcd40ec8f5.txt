I liked the dinosaur scenes.
I never really connected with King Kong.
Many of the action scenes were so quick and bumpy that they made me motion sick.
Although many people die, there isn't a lot of blood.
They had some times where they were trying to develop that relationship, but I never really connected with him.
It had some good parts.
Maybe it will be better on the smaller screen.
I was a bit disappointed.
Therefore, I didn't really care when he died.The biggest problem in these two was the first.
Jack Black was perfect for the role of "Carl".
Here are a few things that lowered the rating for me:1.
I really liked the character "Jack".
I came into this movie with high hopes.
That certainly didn't help me enjoy the movie.2.
It's really hard to enjoy a movie that makes you feel sick when you watch it.

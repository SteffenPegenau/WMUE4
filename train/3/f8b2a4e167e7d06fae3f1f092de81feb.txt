With all the things you can do in the game a 9 for some people for others a 8.
The games OK.
I thought that was just OK.
Psst, please!
I prefer the real McCoy.
COD4 is a 10, this game?
I guess these GTA honks don't get tired of punching anyone for no reaason or killing them without a thought.
Seems like a rent to me.
The lead character is a Bosnian refugee, why?
No way this game is a 10.
It's fun for about a day to do that.
It's like one big demolistion derby.
A week or two to rent it and that's being nice.
Graphics aren't in the least Next Gen or is the gameplay.
Flying at night is cool and it's that virtual world, but the multiplayer is lame, guns aren't very pronounced, shooting and driving aren't perfect in any way, it's not streamlined.
People thought San Andreas was great.
Going to a strip club to get a lap dance, maybe the little pimply kids buy it for that.

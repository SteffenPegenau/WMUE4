Remember how pathetic Meryl Streep's Susan Orlean was in the end?
She is the friend of a FAKE PERSON who lied to her.
The previous review is full of bunk.
The family of a fictional person?
TITOR.
WAS.
She knew John Titor personaly... *rolls eyes* JOHN.
But it's good fiction, kind of like Orson Welles radio War of the Worlds, in a manner of speaking.
ahahahah!hey pamela, ever think that the book-maker doesnt want to deal with you b/c he thinks you're lying?
how pathetic do you have to be to believe a lie like that after YEARS!?
...crap)johntitor.comTHIS BOOK IS A WORK OF FICTION.
A. HOAX.
ahahahahah.
Now maybe if the REAL Titor or the real family comes forth, now we're talking..Ever see the movie "Adaptation"?
Yeah, that's Pamela lol (...wait, does that make me fat nicholas cage?

It will not work with the new light saver type of lamps.
Just a note, that this remote seems sluggish.
The reason I like this one is because it doesn't just turn the light on and off, but has the dimmer.
I do need to press it a couple of times, but it works, dims, turns off and on the lamps.
This is a replacement to one I have owned for about 5 years.
It would turn the lamp off and on, but the dimmer didn't work.
So, now I can use it with 2 lamps separately.
So, after searching everywhere, I found this one.
I have another receiver.
It's much better than having to walk across the room and lean over furniture to turn the light on or off.
My old one was great and I never had any problems until a few months ago.
Also I have 2 lamps and it stopped working on the second lamp.
The lamps are in different rooms, but I can operate them both with the remote.
This one comes with only one receiver, but the remote can operate 2 receivers separately.
My old one was not.

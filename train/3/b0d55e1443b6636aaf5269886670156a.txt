I would find a cheaper one somewhere.
I am giving this steamer a neutral rating because a: it is made in China.
Does it do what it's supposed to?
Would I buy it again for the price I paid?
c: this model is way way way too expensive for the lack of features.
I've made perfect shrimp and corn on the cob.
The process is quite simple... heat water and add items above the water so to cook them without washing away the flavors and nutrients.
What can I say about a steamer?
You bet it does.
Do I regret buying this one?
No.
No.
In summary, if you want a steamer that works but lacks some great features (like a water level meter) and don't mind paying for the convenience of free shipping you will be served well by this steamer.
Yes, a person can do this in many ways without spending money on yet another gadget but oh this gadget is worth paying for.
b: there is no recipe book for those of us who have never used a steamer before.

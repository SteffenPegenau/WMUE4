I decided to try again.My next herb kit is in there right now.
My first round of mixed herbs went pretty well.
I got this garden for Christmas.
I think I harvested a little early and took to much off at first.
I'm going to have to start over again!
Also, something was eating my basil.
There are a ton of them everywhere.
Little nats or white flys are everywhere.
Not doing so well.
However, you need to follow the directions for harvesting.
I did get some nice herbs and enjoyed cooking with them at the beginning.
Everyday I would find little bite marks on it.
Some of my plants did not look so good after awhile.
I tried to spray them with an herbal spray but it killed the nats and and injured the plants.
My garden never really looked like the picture.
They must have come with the plants.
I rinced them all off but they are stuggling.

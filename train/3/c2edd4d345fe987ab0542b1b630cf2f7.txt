Do you fear death?
And yet, some powerful questions to ponder about.
Why are you here?
", this may be a great start-up.
Easy read.
Actually a bestseller.
(Finished it in one sitting).I felt it was a bit simple and perhaps it is because I read so much of the like of Tony Robbins and such.
But for those starting this journey of "why am I here?"
and "now what?
And a lot more questions to ponder.
Simple book.
The book goes in, in a form of a story, to show that why doesn't need to wait for "retirement" to do what they love, their Purpose For Existence.
If you do it now, you will realize that you don't need much stuff to make you fulfilled (and perhaps you can get paid to do what you love) and then you don't need to fear death cuz' you fear it only when you are not doing what you love.
Are you fulfilled?
The Why Cafe: A very simple book.

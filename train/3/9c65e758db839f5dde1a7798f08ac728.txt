Check them out.
From what I've heard there's actually supposed to be a longer director's cut edition planned and a lot of footage was removed from this version.
No montage or anything.
Two great films.
Maybe go back to sci-fi since he created Alien and Blade Runner, two films that are superior to this one.
Everything seemed kind of rushed to me.
Maybe when the extra footage is added it will get a 4 star rating from me.
Another good release you should pick up is Skinny Puppy's Greater Wrong of the Right Live.
I think he trained in about 30 seconds before getting in an actual fight.
However, I do have to say I wish Ridley Scott would do some stranger films since he's done two epics already.
Specifically, the training sequence with Neeson's character.
I was suprised with this one since I had heard such bad things about it.
I expected it to be a complete trainwreck but it wasn't.
Sure, it has some problems.
Kingdom of Heaven is a very underrated film so pick it up.

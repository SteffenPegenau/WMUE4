I might also point out that even though I am reviewing the "Thermaltake" model, all the mousepads that look similar to this are made by the same cheap chinese company.
Also, the led lights were sort of distracting.
then, after only two months it up and dies on me.
never really liked the mousepads anyway.
ended up with a cheap "WowPad".
it works).
even let me keep the broken one.
called amazon and they shipped me out a free replacement.
first mousepad arrived broken.
it fits nicely on my keyboard tray thing and hasn't broken on me yet!
my "fixed" mousepad came in to take its fallen heroes place.
So now I have two glowing LED mousepad things.
the one that arrived "good" started to only show one or two colors.
(one of the connectors on the USB cable was not making contact, a snip here some soldering there, Presto!
again works for 2-3 months before it too came to an early demise.
it is just different branding.

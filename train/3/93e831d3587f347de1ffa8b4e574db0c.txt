Its a funny trend to have big names come in and win the belt within a few months: Christian Cage, Sting, and now Kurt Angle.
RVD is soon to join the ranks of TNA.
Senshi?
I do think its a good move.
The matches are endless if they choose to play there cards right.
RVD vs AJ Styles?
Too bad TNA is turning out to be WCW circa 2000.
WWE is in a rut and people are getting sick of the company.
Sting?
Samoa Joe?
TNA should grow more talent like Styles, Samoa Joe, and Fallen Angel instead of stars like Tomoko, Basham, The Steiners, Dudleys, Road Warrior Animal, Angle, Sting, etc.
The Fallen Angel?
TNA is a great company for fans who long for the era of WCW VS WWE.
Do you sign a deal with TNA and automatically get the world title?
TNA should take over as the #1 company but has yet to do it.
Everyone claims to hate ECW but it gets the same ratings as TNA on Thrusday.

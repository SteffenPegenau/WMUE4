Rent or buy this film if you're interested in seeing great actors at the top of their game.
It was obvious that turning the book into a film was a challenge.
It almost makes it.
His intensity as an actor never fails to amaze me.
He's a fantastic actor, but is never believable for a moment in this role.
Her subtle and underplayed role is nothing short of heartbreaking.
If only they had found someone other than Hopkins for the lead.
You must see this film for the outstanding, right on the mark performance of Ed Harris.
I haven't mentioned Nicole Kidman because I am still not sure she was right for her role.
The acting however is extraordinary.
Equally brilliant is Anna Devere Smith as the mother.
It does have flaws however.Not the least of which is the miscasting of Anthony Hopkins.
Nevertheless she does a commendable job with a difficult part.
"The Human Stain" is very watchable.
The story is interesting, and holds one's interest for the most part.

This board is stiff and takes off like a rocket.
Its the most real BB ever produced.
Handles big surf with confidence and speeds you out of the pit in Safety.This board ripps.
I am a larger rider?
This one is the finest EVER produced.
Jarring ride.
ITs really fast and will rip the top off on rollos and cut backs.
Because it is stiff it does not rotate as well for spinners like a non-stringer board.
Depending on on your style, conditions at your local break and preference in tails.
It works for me.
205lbs and 6'.
Its shaped like no other board, wide and stiff.
As soon as you drop in your gone.
I have owned several different types of BBoards.
The hand grips on the front are the best.If your serious about riding big waves, get this stick.
Worth the bucks.

This collection ROCKS.
Fetish is a nice collection of tracks dealing with the subject of sex.
This re-release adds "Black Leather" (live).
She has an album "in the can".
While "Fetish" & "Baby Blue" (not the Badfinger song) are fine new tracks, Joan needs to get an full album of totally new material out.
She has a new look and an even harder edge, but is still a great songwriter and performer.
Only "Wooly Bully" bores me.
She has never avoided this subject before and doesn't here.
I can't wait to hear Black Leather (Live).
But it could have benefited from the songs "Just Lust" and "Torture" also.
I already have this CD with 1 less songs from the Joan Jett Fan Club.
Joan was a pioneer for the female rocker.
All the fans know this.
She has a very strong fan base but radio seems to like more feminine women with acoustic guitars.
why leave those off?
It's not needed.
She just needs to find a distributer who will promote and distribute her.

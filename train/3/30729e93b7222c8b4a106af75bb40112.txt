It is a good mixer, but there are many other good hand mixers out there, some for under $10.
This may not mean they are of poor quality, just that they are overpriced.
I bought this for my wife.
I was expecting a whiz-bang item that would do every amazing thing you could think of.
This mixer is another example.
Will a $10 mixer do the job?
Out of the box it was really just another Chinese appliance.
Sure it will.
If you want to pay more because the label says 'Kitchenaid', be my guest.
I'd advise you to shop around a bit before spending big bucks for this.
Is this one worth $70?
Ho hum.
Who knows, this may even have been made in the same factory as the cheapies!
All the reviewers who loved this item have convinced themselves that it is.
For those of you who have been mesmerized by the 'Kitchenaid' label, take note: Most of their kitchen utensils are made in China.
If it didn't say 'Kitchenaid' it would probably sell for less than half of what the 'Kitchenaid" does.

I got rather sick because I didn't eat enough prior to taking the vitamins.
You just have to really eat.
Those who know anything about B-Complex, understands that certain B vitamins are geared towards helping your body create energy.
It is possible that I have to complete the whole bottle, wait a littler longer, before I feel the effects.
I will say that I'm not sure if I'll buy these again.
You need to really eat.
These vitamins are harsh on the stomach.
I am going to try other B-complex vitamins after I'm done with this bottle.
I've been taking these for a month now.
The bottle does say, 'High Potency' and that it is.
They are half gone.
I'm not talking about just a snack or a small meal.
I'm taking these pills for energy purposes.
I didn't rate it a 3-star due to this incident.
I rated it 3-stars because I haven't felt any of the positive effects.
It's not the product's fault though.
You HAVE to make sure that you really eat.

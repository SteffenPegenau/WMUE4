But that's just me.
After using my EV for about 2 years no mike sounds as good too me.
The Audix sounds muddy.
I plan on using it as a back up, just in case something goes wrong with my EV.
Very disappointed after reading such good reviews.
Thanks Amazon for your fast service.
Maybe just a tee little bit cleaner, but not much.
Don't go by this review it may be the right mike for you, it's just not for me.
Some may like the sound of it.
I've worked with the highs,brought down the lows,mids, still the same.
Just got this mike 3 days ago.
But then again to each his own.
This mike is made very good.
The sound is not as great as my Shure 58.
As far as sound goes, I'll stick with my EV N/D767a.

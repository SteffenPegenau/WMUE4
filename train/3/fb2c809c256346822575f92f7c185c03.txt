Is it completely lubricated and ready to go as shipped?
Is that standard for air tools?
I saw someone wrote that they just dip the head in oil.
Again, I just don't know.
This will hopefully be a great tool but newbies beware.
Yeah but, for instance, the lubrication instructions say:" Disassemble gearing and lubricate components."
That's it, no elaboration.
Maybe they don't want you to do that yourself?
Now I'm sure that some of you are thinking "Whadaya want?
Can't use it without one.
And the thing doesn't come with a connector.
You push the button and it goes."
I don't know.
There is a safety manual that is just that, a parts schematic and a Product Information booklet with 2 tiny pages in English.
I've been a DIY guy for a long time and I decided to go nuts and get an air ratchet for the first time.
Maybe I'll try that.
I guess there must be some sort of secret brotherhood of air tool users because, as G. Johnson said in his review, there ain't no instructions.

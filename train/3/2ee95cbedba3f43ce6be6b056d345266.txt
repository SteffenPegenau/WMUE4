Smaller toys, LT is ok.
Nice color2.
It came with missing and defective parts.2.
We have it in our game room.4.
It doesn't take up too much space.
Once you get it together, it seems to be pretty sturdy.5.
The edges/corners of many pieces require extensive trimming/sanding.
Good size slide for a toddler, compare with other similar products out there.3.
One of the replacement part that we received was 3x worse than the original part we had.Would we buy it again??
Little Tikes' customer service is slow but nice.Cons:1.
Probably Not.
Pros:1.
They are not smoothed out or nicely trimmed at the factory, potentially dangerous to toddler's knees, hands, or elbows, as she/he climbing in and out the unit.3.
We purchased several items from Little Tikes, not too impressed with their QC, larger/complicated items seem to be more problematic.
If we gonna buy something like this again, we most likely would go with Step2.

Sorry, I don't get it.
We returned the Vue to purchase this one, the Platinum... still I can't see what all the hype is about.
After all the hype about Keurig single-serve coffee makers, this Christmas we decided to take the leap!
The problem is...
This one's going back, too.
I will say this, after brewing our first cup -- it was smooth.
These machines make weak, flavorless coffee, even brewing Starbucks coffee in them.
I suppose the fast brew time is responsible for this... Not enough time to get any flavor!
We went for the Vue first, as being able to control strength and also having 5 cup sizes to choose from seemed worth it.
We were excited to get this $300 coffee maker home and see what it can do!
It is really WEAK!
Disappointing!
My dad loves his Keurig, so I just know I will love mine, too... Eh, not so much.
What good is an expensive, albeit convenient, coffee maker that brews mediocre (at best) coffee?
No flavor to speak of, even on the "bold" setting!

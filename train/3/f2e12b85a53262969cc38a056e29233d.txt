Next time I buy a bike though, will be from a store where it is already assembled and I can check everything out before purchase.
This is a Great looking bike.
I only get 12 gears instead of 18.
I had to install two new inner tubes because the ones that came with the bike both blew out within the first hour of inflation.
The front brake is useless, so I just removed it.
Well, I can live with just 12 gears, it is more then enough for me.
The agravation saved will be worth the extra cost.
The front brake is garbage.
I am fairly handy and did my best in tweaking all items.
And I was quite careful with the overall inflation process.
Now for the bad.
It does gets me around on short trips, and like I said, it looks great.
It arrived in only two days with the free shipping.
The front wheel wobbles.
The fit and finish is about one can expect for a hundred dollar bike.

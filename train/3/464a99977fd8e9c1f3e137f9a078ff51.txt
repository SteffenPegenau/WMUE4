.
I put the five not so much becuase of the book itself but rather because of what I thought it would contain.
That I think is why americans like it so much.
I have read the book.
I found little of that there if any really and I was very dissapointed.
I am only eighteen but I have mixed feelings about the book.
First of all I plan on majoring in religious studies and the original reason I read the book was to read about zen.
It changed me to the extant that a well written book changes anyone but it lacked faith.
The objection I have to this book isn't the actaul story because that does make you think which is something few books seem to do for me but rather the fact that you can find it under zen buddhism in a library.
go for it if you can't decide.
then again I am an american too so who knows?
it is ineresting.
I would rather have it under philosophy.
maybe.

Please think about it Amazon.
I am very disappointed.
I ordered used Panasonic KX-TSC14W 2-Line Corded Speakerphone with Caller ID from Innkeepers Telecom on Nov 25, 2010.
It functions like a $10 phone.
Of course, I did not expect to get a brand new phone either.
It stated that the condition was like new.
I will not buy anything from Innkeepers telecom again.
It does not come with ac adapter.
If the seller does not have it.
No caller Id, no time, nothing at all.
Without it, the phone has nothing displayed on the screen.
It is over a month now.
That was not true.
Maybe Amazon can help too.
I wrote an email to Innkeepers Telecom to request for ac adapter.
I checked with Panasonic.
I still do not get a reply.
Even the instruction says the phone comes with ac adapter.
please states so.

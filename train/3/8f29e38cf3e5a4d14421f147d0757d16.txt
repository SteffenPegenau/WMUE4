The lyrics on this song are very memorable.
3 Stars1.
"Flow" is another highlight.
The lyrics are good, Sade's voice has not changed at all, and the production is alright at best.
The sound is the same throughout then entire album.
"Lover's Rock" by Sade is not a bad album.
When I listen to an album, I like to experience different feelings, different moods.
The album's title track is nice as well.
Thus album's lyrics have variant subjects, which I appreciate, but the tempos of the songs were basically the same, and that made this album slightly difficult to listen to.I would'nt necessarily recommend this album to people.
Flow3.
It's on the mediocre side, but it is enjoyable.
The album as a whole is good.
By Your Side2.
I'd recommend it to Sade lovers, or big neo-soul fans.
King of Sorrow5.
My beef with this album is that this group made no attempt to switch things up.
Somebody Already Broke My Heart4.
Immigrant
"By Your Side" is this album's only release, and it is a nice song.

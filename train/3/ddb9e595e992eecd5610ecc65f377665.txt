Even in meditating.
I gave it a three review because it was not my cup of tea.
Trust me...for the price, it is so worth it.
I just didn't walk away saying "now I know what Mindfulness is" and more importantly "how to practice it".
The parable method of telling stories really makes it impossible to put the book down.
I am more of the kind of person who needs step by step instruction.
Way better than wasting the money on a movie.
Don't get me wrong, it has lots of examples.
It was fun.
If nothing else it is entertaining.
I have read other Hanh books, and they are very much written the same, so I don't fault this book.
Enjoyable.
Each 95% exactly the same as the previous.
It is personal preference.
I gained great insight randomly from the book.
I read it all in one night.

And then, the noisy trompete of Albrici ring brutally the bell in a flamboyant and majestic sonata !
The musicians are phenomenal !
Too disoriented and dark.
We have to wait for the sonatas of Becker and especially the sonata of Meder to open our eyes.
A crescendo full of diversity and surprises !
Trully you'll find cold darkness there.Be prudent !
The latter is remarkable.
First, we have to endure ten minutes of the most annoying pieces Musica Antiqua Koln have ever recorded.
This sonata is so attractive and so powerfull!
Than again, an episode of cold darkness.
Even the viola da gamba sound like clear violins.
A masterpiece to dicover.
Too perplexed !On the whole, I was deceived.
I am still wondering what was the purpose of The Great Goebel in recording this music.
It'chilly but well done.
The sound is deep and rich.An other Cd of Goebel that let me perplexeed !

I know what I am talking about because I have hundreds of dvd-r copy's from them.
I bought two of these titles because I thought the first dvd-r disc had something wrong with it.
Nope, they are both the same.
I have hundreds of dvd-r from this same supplier and yes, I have about 50 that have sound problems and out of those 50 about half of them have picture quality problems.
These films that are not even up to TV quality are not restored prints that I am talking about.
Not all films from this supplier are like this.
However, this print is not good.
But be forewarned this is more than lousy print.
Such a shame.
Love the storyline!
Amazing actors who do a marvelous job!!
I believe in building a video library and this title should be in anyone's library if they love 30s & 40s film!
I am speaking of titles from the 30s & 40s.
The point of this review is to say, great storyline, even better actors!!!
You must have this title!

There's only a couple songs on the CD that have the fast beat, but none of them keep it up through the whole song.
Unfortunatly, Blink has gone a little to MTV.
This album really reminds me of MXPX's Slowly Going The Way Of The Buffalo.
Did they forget how to do it?
The one flaw is also the reason I gave this album 3 stars.
More radio friendly than punk.
They've gotten really good, and their drummer is amazing.
I think it's great.
Blink's not my favorite anymore, but they are still up there.
What happened to the fast punk beat?
I look forward to their next effort.
I love the whole album.
I have a feeling it'll be a lot faster and more energetic after all the flak they'll get from this album, kinda like NOFX's Heavy Petting Zoo.
Check out the drum roll on Going Away To College.
I think Tom and Mark are really trying to make more money than to stay true to their original sound.

Pretty easy to put together.
Not a very big deal, I can sleep well anyway.
It has something to do with the glasses.
They couldn't just replace the glass.
Amazon had to send another fan so I can take a good glass out of the box and return the second fan back.
Well, in the end it worked out w/o too many head aches.
Only 2 things I can complain about.
The Amazon customer service was very nice and efficient in solving the problem.
Nice looks.
One of the glasses came broken in pieces.
Is not a bad buy for the money.
When I touch the glasses and hold them firm, the noise stops.
Second complain I have, it's a bit noisy on the low speed when it's quiet in the house, during the night.
They paid for shipping.
Item arrived in time.
Overall, I'm happy with what I got for the money I paid.

Oedipus should look something like her.
The story of Oedipus is not a bad story.
I think while he was doing that he would pass out from pain.
You have to know all the relationshiops or it will be hard to follow.
But, hey it is just a story.
It just seems that in the story Oedipus may be able to realize that he is related to his mother.
For example everyone knows what happens in the story.
It is one that everyone needs to read because it is a classic.
Has I said earlier it is not a bad story.
I don't think it should take him near has long has it did.
The play has some parts that can be disturbing, for example, picturing him having kids with is mother, raking his eyes out.
It can become a little bit confusing for some.
I don't think very many people could do that to themselves.
There are to many relationships to follow.
Don't go into this story with high hopes.

I would say TRY IT ON FIRST!P.s.
But this tank runs small I guess because it's a large and it feels like it's made for a little girl.
But jeez, I don't want you to buy it bigger and be like "OMG!
It's too big!
I doubt it though.
Well, every other time it's worked.
Normally, I like my clothes at least a little loose fitting.
My title explains it all.
It's so cute though!
I bought the matching pants in a large too and they're slightly smaller as well.
Oh well.
It just doesn't fit.
I wear size 9 jeans, which is average but not fat, if that gives you any idea.
I'm not a fat girl or anything so it's not that.
I wish I had gotten a little bigger size!
I usually just buy Large in anything other than t-shirts.
That girls a liar!"
Maybe it was just mine?

He is an embarrassment to physicists.
It is a little hard to understand but the plot is interesting.
They make fun of science.
This book is just about a teenager named Bobby who turns invisible one day.
They don't talk most of the time when they should.
She then asked a guy on the streets if she was taller than the person next to her.
I wouldn't recommend this book to any of my friends.
I feel this book has its ups and downs.
Then Alicia tells her family and so Bobby's and Alicia's family work on Bobby.
So then she knew Bobby was naked.
But I do not get the father of Bobby(the main character).
Then what is weird is that people believe Bobby is invisible when he tells them.
Then 2 days later he meets a blind girl while his parents were in the hospital.
The man said there was no one.
I would say this book is okay.
Bobby then said he was invisible.
When Alicia(the blind girl) felt Bobby and thought Bobby was naked.

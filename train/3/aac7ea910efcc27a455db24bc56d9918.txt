Games Inc does mention made in China.
The 1980's deck was beautiful.
I would not have bought these had I known the image quality, regardless of the feel.
This deck I bought VERY DISAPPOINTING.
There is NO GLAZE, so the cards seem very cheap.
So, if images were better, might be happy without glaze.
No enjoyment to look, and meditate and focus upon these cards.
I had these cards in 80's.
VERY DISAPPOINTING.
Poor quality cards for Tarot.
These were made in China.
I have been looking for these, Golden Dawn Tarot Cards for a while, so I was glad to even find them.
Images do not extend over entire card.
Feel good in hand immediately.
HOWEVER, WITHOUT THE GLAZE, THE CARDS PICK UP VIBRATIONS VERY QUICKLY.
I wanted another deck, since that deck is gone.
The colors are weak and dull.
So it is a trade off.
The images are smaller, on the card.
For the lower price, just ok.

I bought this book and thought it ok and interesting.
Many tanks very young.
Photography only average.
The quality of aquascaping is often poor, many of the tanks have a 'fruit stall look' Some are truly excellent though... Terry Siegels is fantastic, Richard Harkers an inspiration3.
And it's very big'.I bought it , and enjoyed it, but there are better books.
Technical information not complete in my opinion.
What does tank number 1 from GARF look like - I don't know?2.
Long term stability is questionable5.
It is not all ultimate aquariums though...1.
All US.
not really.
Some are very good, some bad and some tanks you don't get a decent whole tank shot.
There's no bad tanks, but ultimate?
Minor point if all the tanks are interesting enough, but often 'here's a jolly nice SPS tank which has been running one year quite well.
Not all tanks especially good.
Fossa and Nilsson's photos of J Sprungs tanks are the best I've seen
Lists not always fully revealing of setup.4.

But I wish that an author who could write more like Mitchell could would write the sequel.
Well, I read GWTW a couple of months ago, for fun, and I LOVED it.
They act more like people now.
I am going to write my own sequel to Gone With the Wind.
GWTW was addicting and I spent days and days thinking what happened next and why Mitchell didn't make a sequel.
Well, I couldn't buy it, but I read a couple of pages out of the Amazon preview, and I HATED it.
I read it over 5 times and I consider it the best book in the world.
I know that Riley isn't Mitchell, but Riley isn't even a very good author.
I will have to buy it and read it anyway, though.
Scarlett is just aweful.
Well, I was doing a project, and I discovered that GWTW has a sequel!
Scarlett is just the name of the main character and it sounds so boring.
Gone With The Wind is a metaphor.
Also, the title is horrible.
None of the characters act like they're in the early 1900's.

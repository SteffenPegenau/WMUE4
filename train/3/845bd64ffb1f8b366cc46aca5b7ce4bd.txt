I like only a fifth of the songs.
(1/5 of the songs i have.
Aka.
Rihanna, SOS: The song is okat but have should have ended a minute ago.
Chamillionare, Ridin': This song has so many pros and cons from me it is hard to review.And so on.....
Now has been making hit CDs of hits songs since the '80s.
To Long.2.
2/5 of the songs are bad.
I'll explain:1.
When i got it and downloaded it i realized i only like a few songs.
Sean Paul, Tempature: The song is a good dance song but what the heck is he sayin'?3.
Amazing....
1/5 of the songs are garbagde like that kieth urban one
But 20 years later is is still goin' strong (like jeopardy) or is it fading away (like the simpsons)?As a preteen i like new music and all i have to say was this album was all hype for me.
This album is okay.

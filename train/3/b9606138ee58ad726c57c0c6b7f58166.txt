Uninspiring music.
She's 5 stars.
This is like Lenny was radical when he was younger, and now he's accepted and the music is mainstream.
I have an interest in Andrea, though.
You can tell; it doesn't sound like this is a band playing with Lenny.
Doesn't make me think.
My hot female friend, Andrea, lent this to me.
I liked the first song, and the rest is downhill from there.
I really find this a waste of money.
"Lenny" is 3 stars.
It is from another time.
It's just kind of boring.
I don't know about this.
Lenny played all the instruments, and it sounds it.
This is like middle aged rock.
I have no interest in this disc.
The music does nothing for me emotionally, either.

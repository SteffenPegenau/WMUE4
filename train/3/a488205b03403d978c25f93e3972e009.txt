That old spark is gone.
Was hooked.
My thought, after watching the first disc was, 'No wonder Carell wants to leave.
Very disappointed in this season.
It's just falling flat.
The first episode I saw was in Season 4.
All I know is I'm not laughing.
Leave before this ship sinks!
I came a bit late to The Office.
What happened?
Something is most definitely missing and I can't quite put my finger on it.
I don't know, it all feels very contrived and... well.. scripted!
Saw a few more, and ran out and bought seasons 1 and 2.
'Bummer :(
The acting isn't the same, the interactions aren't the same.
It truly is one of the funniest, cleverest, well put together shows I've ever seen.
Bought seasons 3-5.
I'd put it up there with my other favorites: Seinfeld and That 70's ShowThen came Season 6 and... blah.
Waited anxiously for Season 6, re-watched seasons 1-5 a few times.

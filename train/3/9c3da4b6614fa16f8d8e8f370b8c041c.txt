Instead of seeing the actual killing, most of the time you just hear the grunts and screams.
I'm hoping there's a sequal to this since they left it open for one.
I'm just sayin it was ok.
I too bought this thinking that it was Rey Misterio.
I didn't hate it nor did I really like it.
Anyways, this movie is sort of Wrestling meets the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
I hope the sequal is better too.
Cool cool.
Thing is, most of the action is blocked out.
Otherwise, I'd just rent it.
Very poorly done, most of the plot doesn't really make sense.
This movie definately could have been done better.
Needs to be lengthy.I say, buy this movie if you are collecting movies of wrestlers.
Then, I thought it was his dad only to learn that his uncle had the name.
And the time on it isn't very long.

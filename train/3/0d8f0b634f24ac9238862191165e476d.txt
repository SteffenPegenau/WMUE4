The first toaster was very slow to toast, also.
If you looked at it while it was heating, you could see that the outside wires never turned red.
If you set it above a 2, it burns.
I don't know about this one yet.
We needed a 4 slice toaster and I checked several places before settling on this one.
Wish I had bot the cheaper one at Wal-mart or Target.
Since they usually have top quality products at the cheapest price, I didn't shop around for the price.
I just plugged it in to check it out.
For the money, I think it's a rip-off.
From the beginning, it only toasted the inside half of each piece of bread.
I bot this toaster at Sams.
One side worked properly, but the other side (the far left slot) only heated up on one side.
I returned it and got another one.
Unfortunately, Sam's was considerably more than purchasing it online.
I haven't decided whether to return it again, or just live with it.

Make a game that is LIKE football really is.
ESPN 2K5 was the best ever.
Example.
If you are gonna do that at least steal some damn features.
Don't get me wrong, I had my beefs with 2K5 (injured players, impossible passing) but the gameplay felt real.
And can I get a halftime show with real alumni like when you first turn on the game?
One word, realism.
If anyone in real life actually did a spin move like the ones in NCAA 06, can you say torn ACL?
EA 's like, if you can't beat em' buy em out.
Spin moves.
Oh, and custom soundtracks.
I like the new features.
I love college football, but this needs some work, but that goes for EA football games in general.
The NCAA 06 is good but needs an overhaul, improved graphics, and please fix the gameplay.
I hated to admit it, being a Madden fan from way back in the day.
Can someone please have EA Sports make a realistic football game?

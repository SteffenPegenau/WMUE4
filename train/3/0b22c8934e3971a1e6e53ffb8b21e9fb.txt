But I might.)
What about it?
(I doubt it!
"Crumby" and "Phoney" were seriously over used to the point that it made you sick in the stomach.
Holden was so feed up with people dying, that he wished that he could wait by the edge of a cliff, and when a kid comes running out of a rye feild, Hoden would "swoop down" out of nowhere and catch the kids.
To me this book seemed entirly too whinny and used too much compulsive slang.
I did catch the under lying things in the book.
But it did make me laugh sometimes, I'll give it that.
I know what you are thinking, "what about the symbolism?"
Like for starters, what "The Catcher in the Rye" means.
I seriously disliked this book.
Okay, some day when I'm old and gray, maybe I will get why this book is an all-time master peice.
I'm not denying that it was a humourous book at times it was just too "loose".
(The topic swayed from thought to thought).
But I just don't understand why people think it so great.

In terms of body piercings, I rather like navel piercings, considering them decorative.
(See below.)
There are two girl/girl sequences that are lacking in this regard.
Most of the breasts appear to be real.
I really dislike the circular and flattish kind that I find grotesque.)
I consider the best Penthouse dvds to be the gold standard in soft core.
There is a general absence of tattoos and the kind of body piercings I dislike.
Full frontal and rear exposures generally are pretty good.
However, I consider tongue, nipple, clitoral and labial piercings to constitute self-mutilation and find them grotesque.
I don't care for a lot of tattoos.
This is a pretty good effort by Peach.
(I really don't mind breast implants that have a semblance of normality to them.
With Peach you generally know what you get and don't get.
Peach has done better than this one.Personal preferences: I prefer normal breasts to fake ones.
Peach comes in second followed by Playboy and Vivid.

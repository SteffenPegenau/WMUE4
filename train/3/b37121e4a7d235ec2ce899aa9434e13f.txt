However, I dont understand how everybody is saying how they were "on the edge of their seat" with this film.
I gave it 3 stars not because its a horror flick, but because the acting was decent.
C'mon, backwood hick redneck comes to fix your car in the middle of the desert, clear out of nowhere.
To me, it was fairly predictable.
We get a bit drawn in to their experience.
With all of the hype this movie got, I expected some clever twists and turns, uncharacteristic of typical slasher movies.
Been there, done that.
O yea, no surprise there.
I dont know, I just dont get it.
But as far as the horror goes, what horror?
As far as the characters go, yea we relate to them.
I was dissapointed.
Instead, we got a half-acted drawn out generic slasher.
Maybe some twists in some spots, but overall, predictable.
Most of the time, everyones crying,running and hiding.
I was not the least bit disturbed by any of it.

Certainly room for a 4th installment.
Boring villians.
Dull action scenes.
Caine is good.
Hathaway is a good Catwoman but is in the wrong movie.
There will be more Batman movies.
Prison scenes go on forever.
Bruce Wayne is boring after awhile.
Movie overrelies on mood music.
Bale is too arrogant and smug to play psychologically tortured.
Maybe they won't be pretentious and dull like this one.
Same thing happened to Miichelle Pfeiffer.
Bane is just an obligatory bad guy.
Freeman is unnecessary.
Surprisingly dull.
Or maybe another reboot.

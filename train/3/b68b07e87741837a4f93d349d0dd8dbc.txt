Scene change or transition?
A different, more complex ending requiring Tiffany's knowledge might have made this a four-star movie.Tiffany's song over the end credits is a nice touch.
Surface-to-surface suicide piranha squad?
Check.
sound effect.
Super-macho hero?
The "Making of" and "Bloopers" features add something to the whole package.
The whole movie is completely unrealistic, of course, but that is the whole point.
Cue the "Whoosh!"
The piranha special effects are hilarious and effective.
Check.
However, the ending is a let-down.
Turn off your brain, relax, and just go with it.
Three stars for being fun and taking the piranha monster-movie genre to a new level.The characters are competent and believable enough for this movie.
"Mega Piranha" is a lot of fun to watch.

That which ignites the nostalgia in you..and that which your kids will one day roll their eyes at.
It seems that the negative reviews are proving the point of the movie.
Everything a movie should be.
See it and appreciate is as an homage to the rotary phone.
The new, young, glossy and glitzy will steal the attention of the majority almost every time.
Or the record player.
It's entertaining.
Unless you charge a lot for it and pin a fancy name to it (ie, Sweded.)
It's fresh.
And Mos Def, to boot.
Plus, it's got Jack Black and Mia Farrow.
Who I happen to think is highly underrated as an actor.
And the oneness that emerges from the joining of the two.
Or whatever it is that clings to your memory as a part of the iconography of your generation.
It's unique.
Or the 8-track.
This funny, thought-provoking movie succeeds in having me longing for the simple, sweet, innocence of old, whether it existed in reality or not.
The merging of the old and the new.

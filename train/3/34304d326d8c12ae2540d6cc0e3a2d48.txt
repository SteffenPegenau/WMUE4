Method Man?
Hardcore rapper Method Man?
All in all, Kelly is capable of being one of the best, but she's in desperate need of some good material.
Tracks like "She Wants You", "Mirror, Mirror", and the song with Gerald Levert and K-Ci are all about cheating, trying to get with someone when you have someone and stuff along those lines.
She continiously runs over the same topic of her man cheating on her.
All the guest appearances do not mesh well with Kelly.
She has an enoromous range.
With Kelly?
Puh-lease.
Kelly blew up on the strength of "Friend of Mine", (which was about a friend taking her man) that song was remarkable, but enough is enough!
But her music/writing is pretty boring.
They would sound better with a Mary J., not Kelly.
She tried to pull off the R&B/Hip Hop thing with some of the songs, but she not one of the artist who could do both, hence Mary J. and Faith Evans.
K-Ci and Gerald Levert got raw soulful voice.
As vocalist Kelly's is great.

Maybe.
It is obviously giving us many strong messages but not, I fear, terribly effectively.
Or it seemed so.The film was a good idea, not realized.
The star-transit scenes especially just don't work.
It was featured maybe 10 times!
It had beauty and striking composition and often effective music/video coordination and then ... strangely, is unecessarily repetitive.
It is not finished!
The very high rating given this DVD sold me on it.
I am disappointed to have bought it.
It is over-rated, I think.The film needs editing down to 1:20 or less.
Once was plenty.I might feel I'd gotten my money's worth if I'd rented this DVD.
And a good many scenes are repeated twice, three times, even.
It's a close call.
I mean, how many times do we need to see the great arch at Arches National Monument?
I wish I had not bought it.

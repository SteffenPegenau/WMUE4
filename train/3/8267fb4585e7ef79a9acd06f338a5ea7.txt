Ashlee Simpson has never made an impression on me.
Just okay again.
However, 'I Am Me' shines a different light on Simpson.1) Boyfriend - Edgy, but boring.
6/10.2) In Another Life- Decent.
I also believed that her voice was absolutely horrendous.
8/10.11) Say Goodbye.
7/10.73/110- 66%: ** 1/2 - ***
6/10.7) Burning Up- Lifeless and not her style.
Her voice fits her style of music, but still is not impressive.
4/10.8) Catch Me When I Fall.
6/10.3) Beautifully Broken- Mellow and sweet.
7/10.6) Dancing Alone- Just okay.
When 'I Am Me' was released, I gave it a chance and it was semi-worth it.
Cool and flowing.
8/10.4) L.O.V.E.- Fun, yet boring.
7/10.9) I Am Me- Grungy and cool.
During the 'Autobiography' era, I had much dislike for her music.
7/10.10) Eyes Wide Open- Grungy and edgy.
7/10.5) Coming Back For More- Good.

How sleazy.No, I'll continue to wait for the announced (years ago) MGM sets.
I suspect that this is the work of this same company--apparently they've just re-packaged these "sanitized" versions, trying to trick us.
When asked about this, their rep was evasive.
Of course, they don't reveal this.
AL
Again.
Don't know for sure, but the fact that the "product description" above has no description of any kind makes me VERY suspicious.
There must be a reason, but what could that be?
Hello?!
What in the HELL is going on?
I've tried every which way to contact MGM but they refuse to respond.
NETFLIX has them listed--but not for normal rental!
This mystery just goes on and on.
I watched half of the first episode, saw immediately that it was not the original version so I demanded my money back and they very reluctantly did so.
I got burned once by a Canadian outfit which offers 3 thru 7 in 2 boxed sets that are made up of all the censored/edited episodes.

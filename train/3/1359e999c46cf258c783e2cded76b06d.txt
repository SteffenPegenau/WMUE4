Seriously...move on.
And this is not the place for it.
If you want to review either Carrie or Bo's single, then there is NO need to mention the other one.
Again, stop voting!
5 stars is PERFECT.
You only make yourself look bad when you come and write a review on a CD you obvious do not own.
This goes for all the 5 star positive reviews too.
Your posts will be deleted eventually anyway.
Voting ended weeks ago.
They are not competiting.
(It would be sad if you bought a CD of someone that you mention you hate.)
Move on to something mor erecent.
I find it hard to believe that 100% of Carrie and Bo fans TRULY feel their single is worthy of 5 stars.
American Idol ended in May.
No one is competing any more.
Get SOME kind of life other than your bitterness over who lost, or gloating over who won.
Everybody STOP.
The season is over.

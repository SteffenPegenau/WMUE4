Anyway my friend lent it to me during a boring speech about ma and horses and mama mia, obviously he was kind of tipsy... nobody was really listeningSo i asked my friend for the game.
He lent it to me and when i started i was amazed by the graphics!!
Guy still talking... Now brought in a painting of horses.
This Mario game kicks ... Oh look tea... bye have to go now need to drink tea...GoodBye
The reason i gave it 3 stars and not 1 was 'cause it made time pass pretty quickly.
Oh good noodles hmmmm... Now the guy shut-up.
But the game was very confusing...
Ok, i first played this game during a Chinese New Year Banquet which was amazing...
I love peking Duck...... And those Crab balls... hmmmmm.
Still talking.... Oh look Pork pause game... hmmm good... anyways I got pretty disoriented in the first level unlike i did with Super Mario advance 2.
The game was bad...
2?
Thanks.
Can i borrow Super Mario Adv.
that guy was still talking...

Hmm......*** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for The Passion of the Christ ***1.
I only see a man got tortured & tortured again then crucified in bloody violent ways, finally died.
DVD Featurability: VERY WEAK3.
The whole movie script is spoken in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitle; however, quite alot of scenes seem missing subtitle.
Period.Be honest, say if the man in the film is not Jesus, would you rate it the same?
Picture Quality: EXCELLENT4.
Yes, you will see how Jesus suffered and died, vividly to your eyes.
If not, because he's not Jesus?
Nothing.
Period.
Sound Quality: EXCELLENT(Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 1-Oct-2004)
Film Rewatchability: LOW2.
Do not expect any delete scenes, extra features, casting, or director's commentary.
This seems a documentary film to me.
Basically the film zooms into the final 12 hours in the life of Jesus.
I don't see Christ but brutal violence.

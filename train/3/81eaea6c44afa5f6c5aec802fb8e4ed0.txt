I remember getting Wicked Sensation many years ago when it was first released.
This is a pretty good debut album from Lynch Mob.
George Lynch certainly doesn't disappoint when it comes to his guitar skills.
"She's Evil But She's Mine" and "Through These Eyes" both sport nice and catchy choruses.
Worth a listen.
Some of the songs that I like are "Sweet Sister Mercy," "She's Evil But She's Mine," and "Through These Eyes."
Wicked Sensation is pretty cool.
The album's musicianship, songwriting, and production are satisfying and tight.
There's a total of twelve tracks included on the disc.
Oni Logan does an efficient job with the vocals, also.
It's a little more rougher-sounding than what guitarist George Lynch did with Dokken.
All of them are listenable tunes.
Mick Brown (from Dokken) handles the drums.
There are some nice guitar riffs and solos throughout.
Wicked Sensation is in a straight-ahead hard rock musical direction.

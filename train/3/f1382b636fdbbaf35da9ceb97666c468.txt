Well you go to that other word, get a quick definition and you have to see: something else.
I bought this to get an all in one for college use.
I need a thesaurus, I use my phone instead.
That is what a thesaurus is supposed to be.
All and all the price is decent but I would not recommend this set.
Kind of thought they would be bigger actually.
The dictionary is pretty good but I would have prefered it in a hard cover.
You look up a word and all it tells you is a quick definition and to see: something.
Vocabulary builder is kind of neat.
Kind of kicking myself for not getting it bigger, more the size of a kids text book over a romance novel.
The tesauraus isn't even a thesaurus but more of a bad dictionary.
That bugged me.
That is my biggest issue with this set.
Spend a little more money and get better ones and a REAL thesaurus!!!

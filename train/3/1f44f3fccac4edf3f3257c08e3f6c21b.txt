its a bit late on directions and or gives directions for no reason.
then it has to recalculate.
so i recommended it to my friend as a gift for his wife.i placed the order for him.
can get frustrating.
i paid more just for the device by itself from Best Buy than what my friend paid from Amazon and it included 2 extra accessories(GPS case and stand)!!
its not that bad.
no complaints.
you find yourself arguing and fighting with the device at times.
!
perfect size.
this is not all the time though.
i received the package early from the shipper.
i got my wife one from Best Buys and its all right when it works right.
example, tells you to exit here after you pass the exit and tells you about an exit thats not there.
good deal with the 2 added accessories from the shipper.
it is simple and easy to use though.
not big at all.

Wanted to find something to do some better carving so i got a flowboard.
you need steady incline as well as room to carve/turn.
This board does not allow much for straight riding.
Its a great concept and works for the most part.
I would only recommend this board to people who are looking to carve specifically, Think of this board as a snowsled.
I still give it a three though because given the right road this baby will do wonders.
Full circle brought me back to the boards.
I got a long board.
Loved it.
This is not a casual riding board.
kinda picked up where i left off from.
Just not too many my way at the moment...
Sector 9.
I grew up, moved out and such.
You do the rest of the work.. Its a heavy board.
It feels great carving given you have those conditions.
I skated on the traditional 1980's board and was ok.
it goes down hill only.

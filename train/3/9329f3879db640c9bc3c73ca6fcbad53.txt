Yes, there still isn't any place for a gay man in the service...but all is not lost, he will still have his chance to save the day.
No, of course not.
The two actors playing gay were a touch awkward with each other, though very handsome.
A nice thought.
Except one scientist who resigned from the military, coming out as a gay man in the process.
And the Earth.
Both actors are very mascluine, not parodies, for once.
Will anyone listen?
So it depends what you like.
Two meteors are heading towards Earth and one, the sneaky one hiding behind the first, is on a collision course with our Planet!
The acting was fair.
I wished fervently for more obvious intimacy between them, after all they are seriously involved, right?
I only wish they were more comfortable with each other.
Well, I liked the story idea.
Well, at least an attempt is being made to have a heroic gay couple.

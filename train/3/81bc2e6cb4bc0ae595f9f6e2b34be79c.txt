Packing was two sheets of brown paper.
Also 4 of the 6 magazines had a pellet left after taking the 10 shots.
Some of the pellets stayed in the empty milk carton I was using as a target, so not overwhelming power!
They arrived seperately from the gun etc.
We'll see how it goes with the rest.
Must be the location these are coming from.
Out of the original packaging and rolling around a box you could put about 8 of the product boxes.
This time not so much.
Product arrived like many others have described.
Usually the packaging is very professional.
The gun is a brand new Crosman 357 the carts Daisy.
I took my time between shots.
I gave them a 3 not because of Amazon's packing but because they do what I assume they are supposed to so that's average/good.
I got 60 shots out of the first and only cartridge.
This is most unlike Amazon.

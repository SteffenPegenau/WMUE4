Also, S.W.A.T.
The team should have won together.
As a Police officer I generally give Hollywood a handicap when it comes to Cop movies and how they protray us.
The plot here is far from 100%, and it was not in line with the tactics, nor the action of the film.
or E.S.U.
Officers across the country what Backdraft did for Firemen.
It does not do for S.W.A.T.
I will say on the bad side.
The individual Officer who saves the day at the end of this movie was not the way to finish it.
The weapons, and devices are state of the art.
(Emergency Services Units) are all about team concepts.
However, on the up side it has some great action.
See you at the movies TC
It will keep you entertained if you ignore the plot.
It is great to watch the team in action, and the wit of dialogue between characters is very good.

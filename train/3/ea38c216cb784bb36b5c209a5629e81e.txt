I really enjoyed this picture.
I was really enjoying the Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde character!!!
I also enjoyed Mina's Vampire character.
Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, Wilhelmina Harker, Dorian Gray, Tom Sawyer, and Dr. Jeckyll.
You have the usual plot of who is trying to be a saboteur, who can you trust, tease of a past love affair, and some good action.
Watching him change, and this big monster actually be heroic!!
!
Connery is Quatermain.
She was so lady like, even after biting someone's neck!!!
The movie is really good, and it really surprised me.
While this movie is not great, you get drawn in.
You will find yourself rooting for him big time.
To truly appreciate this movie you had to have a love of literature.
Loved her!!
This movies brings together some very unlikely heroes to help save the world from a madman that is planning the destruction and take over of the world.

It hurts to watch this episode.
Seeing Xena beheaded is over the top.
To die is one thing, but the way she dies is just sick.
Xena and Gabrielle should have walked off together like Hercules and Ioalus.
The blame falls square on the shoulders of the Executive Producer and Lucy's husband, Rob Tapert.
Both Lucy and Renee gave 110% to this 2 part episode.
At the end they ride off together on the same horse.
Seeing Gabrielle all alone was more than I could bear.
I'm a loyal Xenite and have been for most of the series.
He made the decison to have Xena die.
I have seen all 134 episodes numerous times.
All the special effects were fantastic.
But the plot falls short of our expectations of how the series should have ended.
If you love Xena and Gabrielle like I do....watch "When Fates Collide" as your series finale.
This series finale doesn't work for me.
It's much easier on the heart.

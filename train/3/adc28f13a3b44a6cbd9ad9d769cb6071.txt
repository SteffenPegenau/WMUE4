That's enough said.
***New Age Outlaws v. Legion Of Doom World Tag TitlesAbsolutely a classic match.
It was a good opener but Vader wins.
Max Mini's team wins the match.
**Max Mini, Nova & Mosica v. Battalion, El Torito & Tarantula 6-Man TagFunny as anything but it was horrible action.
****1/2Shawn Michaels v. Undertaker World TitleBOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Yet very fun.
Rock wins when he cheats because he puts the knucks in Shamrock's tights.
I don't care if Austin won this was still a great Rumble.
It is not as good as people say it is.
This was the Legion Of Doom's greatest match ever.
***for how funny it was.The Rock v. Ken Shamrock IC TitleThis match is very overrated.
Kane screws Undertaker and Shawn retains.
Foley comes out as 3 different guys.
*****Royal Rumble MatchA great Royal Rumble.
Goldust v. VaderVery boring match.
New Age Outlaws retain.

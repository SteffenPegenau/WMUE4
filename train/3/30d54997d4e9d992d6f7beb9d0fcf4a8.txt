The music remains a highlight.
I hope, if there is a sequel to made here, that Richard Roundtree gets more screen time.
The action is not bad.
Shaft.
Had to be amazing right?
Williams, not a bad actress, is wasted here and basically ignored.
Before you buy this, go see the original, now on DVD.
It is over the top, but is pretty dumb.
Samuel L. Jackson.
Several other excellent reviewers have talked about it, but I never really bought it.
Vanessa L. Williams.
Samuel L. Jackson does his usual super job and is still the coolest man in movies.
The original Shaft is amazing.
Funny, cool, and the real deal.
Singleton is still reaching to find that potential we all saw with "Boyz in the Hood."
The plot (with a Christian Bale doing a lousy impression of his American Pyscho character) is fairly weak.
John Singelton.
Dan Heyada is really funny.
Wrong.

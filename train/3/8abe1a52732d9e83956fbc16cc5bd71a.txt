The particular pas de deux featured from the Prince of the Pagodas is not actually included in the video so I don't know why it is on the cover.
"Le Corsaire" Fonteyn and Nureyev.
The choice of dancers and ballets leaves a lot to be desired.
I found the picture on the video cover misleading.
The collection includes: "Spring Waters" Bylova and Nikonov.
"The Prince of the Pagodas" Bussell and Cope.
"Swan Lake" Makhalina and Zelensky.
"Nutcracker" Collier and Dowell.
"Manon" Penney and Dowell.
"A Month in the Country" Makarova and Dowell.
I have seen better performances of some of the ballets by other dancers.
"Spartacus" Mukhamedov and Bessmertova.
"Le Corsaire" Asylmuratova and Neff.
The choices were okay, not great.
"Don Quixote" Havey and Baryshnikov.
"The Sleeping Beauty" Kolpakova and Berezhnoi.
"Romeo and Juliet" Ferri and Eagling.
"Swan Lake" Cooper and Ambler.
Overall, this collection feels more like a promotional video than one of historical or artistic significance.

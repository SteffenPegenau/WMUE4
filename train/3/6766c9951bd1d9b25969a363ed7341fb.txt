It's 2000 for pete's sake.
I just bought a similar device that allows me to fast forward and rewind.
Not possible.
This is a very nice looking product, but it comes up short on a number of key areas in MP3 mode.
1.
It also displays MP3 artist/track info, the only problem is that it is a major pain to move to different albums.
Holding the fast forward button down causes the unit to advance to the next album.
I would have kept it had it allowed me to fast forward and rewind while playing mp3 tracks; the mp3 label info display wasn't all that important to me.
For example, let's say we are listening to an MP3 track and we want to rewind it a bit.
oh well, it too shall be returned...
Especially with the sticker price, they should be ashamed.
It is not possible to search throughout a song.
3.
No MP3 label information display.Philips can do better.

I alude to my main complaint (I consider it a major one!)
I agree on both counts.
One other lesser complaint - The specs describe a 12" depth.
But... Come back to the price, and it's not a bad buy.
Reviewers mentioned a great gel pad and a need for Loctite.
Overall, this is a nice looking product for the price.
I did a lot of on-line research before I chose this tray.
Too early to tell how it will perform over time.
Technically that's true.
I might have chosen differently had I known.
Also, the instructions are as bad as others say.
in the title - The product specs say the tray is metal.
However, it is mounted on 14" slides!
It is definitely not!
Nice looking, but not very strong plastic.

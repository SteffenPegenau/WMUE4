That really happened.
That particular person also mistook Sesshoumaru for a female but I can forgive her for that.I'd love to buy the rest of the series, but I'm pretty darn sure that I can live without it until the prices go down.
Are you sure???"Yes.
One day.
Very bad.
:*Opens first page* "That girl looks really mad.
Who is she?""Oh!
*gets head bashed in by me*And even!
I ordered the first two of the series.I was pleased with the fact that they were a pretty good length, but I'm still reeling over the cost!American dollars are bad.
(confusing isn't it?
(Trusted ones mind you.
)I have shared it with a few of my friends.
Sooooo expensive to replace!
)They had a lot of reactions ranging from:*yoink* "I'll see you after Japanese" *runs off clutching book muttering 'My preciousssss'*To:"Oh, they aren't very good quality drawings, are they?"
Am so broke *droops*.I love the story very much however, and Inuyasha makes a most adorable villian/good-guy.
He's a guy???

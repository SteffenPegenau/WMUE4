She's excellent with witty dialogue.
!
There were several aspects of this book that annoyed me.
Now just the usual track all the time, we get to go to New Orleans!
Christina for one.
I liked the change of scenery.
She's bratty and obnoxious.
Having said all this, they are chosing to end the TB series.
I also liekd how the racing scenes are written.All in all, it's get's 3 stars.
There's also some cool character interaction as there is in all of Dickerson's books.
I don't like how Karle Dickerson portrays her character.
Not the best in the series, but I've read far worse.
And she whines all the time.But, positive things.
This really saddens me and I'd hate for that to happen.
Please don't end the TB series!!

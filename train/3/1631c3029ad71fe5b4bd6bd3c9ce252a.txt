It's not a documentary on the habits of wolves in the frozen wastelands of Alaska.
etc"', gimme a break.
You either loved it or hated it.
The acting was awesome and I thought the ending was spectacular.
3 words.
Watch a PBS special for that.
While it's definitely not a 5 star flick like the aforementioned Jaws, it at least deserved 3.
For those of you reviewers who actually took the time and effort to write in "wolves don't act like that, and etc.
Very bold on the directors part.
Personally I enjoyed it.
It's interesting to me that a movie can have over 100 5 star reviews, and an equal if not more 1 star review.
"It's a movie!"
Entertainment.
All I can say is, most people I've spoken to enjoyed it.
etc.
I suppose you're the same people that waste our time arguing that a Great White Shark would NEVER leap out of the water onto a boat or chew on an oxygen tank.

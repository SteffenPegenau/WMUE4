compared to spiritual machines, this is complete garbage.
now, by no means is this the worst OLP album.
i could have lived without these songs.
i go to the shows and buy all the albums and enjoy every minute of it.
i know what OLP is capable of and this doesnt even come close.
really, this record didn't need to be made.
naveed, let's face it, totally [stinks].
i can't say that for the past three albums.
they're not that great.
honestly, i'm a huge fan of OLP.
if not, you'll live without it.
about 4 of the songs are super mediocre, very odd for this band.
everything else sounds like everything on the radio.
however, this is extremely easily the second worst.
there is really only one impressive track on this, being innocent.
if you're a fan of radio music that sounds exactly the same as everything else, enjoy.

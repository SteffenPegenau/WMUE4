The art files are installed in the wrong place by the installation program!
Wait a minute.
So...I purchased a new ATI Radeon video card.
This is fixing an installation problem.
I updated drivers.
It still didn't work.
It still didn't work.
Then I found the document on drivers on the support site.
First let me say that this was a pain to get working.
I bought it and it didn't work with my system.
But the store I bought it at would not allow software returns.
Ironic that religion could have that much effect and says much in our religiousless liberal society, but that is another topic.Overall, I like the game.
Adding religion and Great People is a big deal and seems to change the game.
Bad...After getting it finally working, I've enjoyed the game.
Yes you have to update drivers, and then move some files around.

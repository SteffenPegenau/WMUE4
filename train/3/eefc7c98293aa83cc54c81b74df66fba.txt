Nice crisp sound output.Cons:1.
Long cord.
Good ambient sound blocking.
If you wear them without any music playing, it feels as if you have cotton stuffed in ur ears.2.
This puts some pressure on ur outer ear as the headphones fit quite snuggly.
Cheap3.
solid contruction.5.
They are adequate.
The hollow spot at the center of the ear cup that is supposed to cover ur ear is small, about 1 1/2 inch by 3/4th inch.
Sound is a bit flat for me.
the bass wasnt deep and the trebles werent sharp enough.
Extended use causes a bit of discomfirt.2.
Nice carry pouch.4.
I need to play around with the equalizer to see if I can fix this.
Nothing great, I wasnt blown away so to speak.About the headphones being too small, hmm dunno, I found them adequate, yes they are tight, but I having them looser would make them constantly slip from the head.Pros:1.

That one is a lot better.
If you haven't read No Way Out, try that.
Also, the characters are too Two-dimensional.
This books is not as good as I thought it would be.
In addition, there was really not much suspense in it.
I also felt that Dylan's character was overshadow by Carson Brook's in every way, from looks to power.
After all, Dylan is suppose to be the leading male character and should be better.
They went through half of the book without so much as a kiss or a romantic thought about each other, yet all of a sudden, they can't keep their hands off each other and fell madly in love.
First of all, the relationship between Sabrina and Dylan is too abrupt.
Doesn't seem real.
Though usually I really like Andrea Kane's books.
Too much focus on the characters' dialogues instead of action.
Is it suppose to be like that?
It lacks both romance and suspense.
All in all, this book was a little disappointing.
Either way, I didn't like that.

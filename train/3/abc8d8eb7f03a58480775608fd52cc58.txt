I take the all over the place now.
No.
So, so I need this set?
They do say,"colors may vary."
I might have been upset if I had a son.I like the set though.
)They are cheap though, and I use them all the time, so it gets a few stars.
We tried!
I have a daughter.
Mine are bright pink.
This one is safe, but don't expect to poke anything (not even roast potato!
It is hard to get forks right I guess, dull to be safe, but still useful.
All the time.Just a note- my other toddler flatware fits in the container too.
The fork- pretty mediocre.
I think the shape works well.
Do I use this set?
Thus, I don't have to worry about the right flatware being clean.The spoon is deep enough for cereal with milk.
Not at the same time, of course, but instead.
I bought them for a road trip.
They stay clean and separate from all the stuff in the diaper bag.
Yes, you could use a plastic bag for the same purpose.

I was most disappointed to find that the near 6 minute mix of Industry's "release Me" was the soft house mix and not the vocal cut of the hardhouse version that dominated the clubs in New York City.
Independence (4:00)
Could have been a perfect series of hard to get tracks, if only it wasn't overloaded with mostly 3 and 4 minute versions, and only a couple of long versions-and the disc doesn't even run an hour.
Feel the good times (3:53)10.
Track times:1.
This great series suffers from one big problem-a very limited number of 12" versions.
As long as you're good to me (3:53)6.
Spend some time (5:09)12.
Tres deseos (3:54)9.
I don't wanna lose your love (4:29)2.
Same thing in reverse (3:57)8.
Somebody else's guy (6:25)5.
I wanna give you devotion (6:28)4.
Release me (5:46)11.
From down tempo old school 80s to house of the 90s, this one is filled with diva vocal (even Boy George).
3 is family (3:32)7.
Turn it up (3:44)3.

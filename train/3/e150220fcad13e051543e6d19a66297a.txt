Nanny loves the boy she cares for, she has a loving family and she worries about money.
AAAAAAHHH!!!!
The authors deal with a real issue (the shallow soullessness of some neglectful parents), but the prose is mediocre.
They know two ways to express emotion: drawn-out spelling and sentence fragments.
"I waaaant it!!"
"You have.
No idea.
These are used enthusiastically throughout the book.Nanny herself certainly has better parenting skills than the family she works for, but I kept waiting for her to show a greater depth of character as well.
"NoooOOOooo."
But she falls in love for shallow reasons like Mrs. X, she values all the expensive trinkets her boss does (she just can't afford them), and she shows Mrs. X's same inability to be direct and stand up for herself.
She never does.
HE'S KISSING ME!!!!!"
What I do.
I kept waiting for a resolution or some wisdom gained that just never came.
After hearing good things about this book, I expected better.
For you."

!Again, a pleasant read right before bed.
And she had to take a whole year off from life to become ok with this?
I enjoy "light" books right before bed, and this fits the bill.
Helped me sleep like a baby.
But.......... Elizabeth Gilbert........... Get Real.........
And they certainly do not have the luxury to run off to Rome then India then Bali for a whole entire year!!
This woman went through what type of hardship?
A light-hearted story to stop your own busy mind and focus on someone elses life.When I really think about this book, it makes me gag.
That's it????
And not only that, but it seems like she's been suffering for several years because of all this.Is she for real?
Then breakup from a different guy?
I enjoy the author's personality throughout this book.
Does she understand that people suffer through much worse than what she's been through?
A divorce?
I read all types of books.

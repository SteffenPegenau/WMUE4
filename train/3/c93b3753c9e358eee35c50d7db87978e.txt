He takes you into the process of what a struggle it was to make some of these pictures.
He even goes on to why Ewan even took the job.
The very interesting thing in the book in the Filmography.
You find out everything about what gossip that happend on the set to the things done off the set.
I pick it because of the great pictures.
It gives ratings, year, production company, cast and crew.
Robert Roy McGregor.
The writter interviews some of Ewan's friends and school mates.
I like this book.
Talk alot about feature movies.
There is 8 pages of pictures.
The writter goes into the history of McGregor.
Especialy A Life Less Ordinary.
I liked it.
All in black and white.
The writter looks at most of his important movies.
It was different from the rest of the Ewan McGregor Books.

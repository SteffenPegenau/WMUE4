It EATS UP your batteries.
I do have one MAJOR complaint, though.
It's fairly user friendly.
it's my first digital.
I'm still not positive that i would recommend it to my cousin who wants one.
A case would have been nice, too.
I'm seriously considering sending it back because of that reason.
But that's my fault for not checking.
Actually it's pretty good, i guess.
If you are on vacation, you might go thru a pack of batteries per day.
I would say that this is a decent digital camera-not great, but not awful.
Also I was disappointed that there was no panoramic feature.
Other than that, I guess it's okay.
This camera is not too bad.
Maybe it's b/c I'm learning the camera and therefore, using it a lot.

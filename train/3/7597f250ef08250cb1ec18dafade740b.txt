If it sounds familiar, it's because it was also sample by Jeru on his solo debut, and Ghostface on Daytona 500.

Picked up this rare CD single in the Fall of '94, as a promo for their upcoming album Coast II Coast that dropped February of 1995.
The track was produced by E-Swift, and contains a sample of "Gimme Me What You Got" by Le Pamplemousse.
Not the best Liks song, but still a hard-to-find CD single.

The CD single tracklisting:1.
(Album Version) (4:49)3.
What's unusual about this single is that E-Swift samples "Nautilus" by Bob James, but it's not listed as one of the tracks sampled.

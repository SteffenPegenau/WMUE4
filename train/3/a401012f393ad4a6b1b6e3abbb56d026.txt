I can't afford to keep replacing these things.
These things are incredible.
Love them...but doubt I would pay full price for them, because I don't use them at work.
First it was the left side.
Why?
For the price I paid, I've never heard any earbuds like these.
I'd like to see how good these are in a plane.
Changed to 3 stars because the durability is not very good for sitting at a desk, apparently.
Bought a new set and now the right side has gone out.
Because one of the damn headphones keeps going out.
Definitely recommend these at the Gold Box price - if you're a baller, pick them up at retail price.NEWI've had two sets of these now.
I can't use them at work, because they completey isolate your ear and music (which makes for a great listening experience).
I picked them up through the Gold Box deal (check it often, I've seen them in there twice now) and holy crap.
So frustrating.
I use them at home.

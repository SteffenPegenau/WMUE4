It could of been alot better.
and I want it to last longer than.
Pick it up and take a read.
The fights were way way to short for there own good and the book tried way to hard to constantly bring back a dieing or dead plot.
True eye candy.
The art is great.
THE FIGHTS!
Fighting all out over the streets of gothem.
I fall.
I think they should of cut out the whole DC and Marvel cross over part to make room for what people picked this up for in the first place.
you win.
I hit you.
I wana see LoBo and Wolvy fight to blood and gutts glory!!!
First off.
But the story line was confussing and dull.
Put don't get your hopes up.
I don't really want to see the new hero try to bring balence to the two worlds.
You hit me.
Your not gonna see The Hulk and Superman leavling mountains or bat-man and Cap.

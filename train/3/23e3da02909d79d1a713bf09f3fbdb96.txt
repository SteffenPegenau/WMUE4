Was this movie birthed from Mew's vagina itself, blessed by the great God Arceus and then knighted by Mewtwo himself?
Pokemon is awesome.
I refuse to allow the man to bring me down.
Will buy a used copy.
Even then, I would only pay forty dollars at most.
REEEEEEEAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLY?!?!?!?!
I just want to relive my childhood without having my wallet sodomized.
No, the problem is the price.
Apparently so.
Whatevs.
REALLY?
Don't get me wrong, I like pokemon, but really?
If this movie was a man I would jump it in a dark alley and have my sweaty way with it.
Is that so much to ask?
This is a load of miltank crap.
This has nothing to do with the quality of the movie.
WHat is with selling this movie for over a hundred dollars?

I guess what I'm saying as a 16 year D.R.I.
If you're more into punk, I would say this would probably be the last D.R.I.
If thrash metal is your cup of tea then you'll love the low-fi sound comparable to a lot of bands on this label at the time.
record and not in a good way.
fan the production on this is like no other D.R.I.
's 3rd full length.
trying to be more of a metal band and stray from social political lyrics that Kurt Brecht is known for writing.
record you'd want to get.
I personally think the production of this is too muffled and what makes this a medicore record.
Lyrics on songs like "coffin" and "go die" show D.R.I.
try to market themselves as a "crossover" band fusing punk and metal.
Again, I'm a 30 year old more into punk/hardcore and songs about telling your "fans" to "go die" is sorta rock star-ish and stupid.
This is D.R.I.
This is where D.R.I.
The songs average 1:30 - 2 minute and decent song writing.

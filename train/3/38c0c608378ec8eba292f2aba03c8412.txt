I'll keep reading the reviews.
I've had it over a year & have yet to have a photo that I want to enlarge more than a 5x7.
I find myself using the older 2400 when it's nearby.
So when my husband suggested I upgrade & he use my 2400 I went for it.
I liked the Fujifilm enough to go with another one.
The colors & definition just aren't there.
The colors & definition was awesome.
I knew that my beloved Nikon FM was just too slow to keep up with all the baby pictures I wanted to take.
Another Fujifilm??
I was given the Fujifilm 2400 as a baby shower gift in 2001.
But I keep window-shopping for an upgrade.
I'm not sure.
I got the A210 and was disappointed.
I do still carry the A210 in my purse all the time & use it very often.
But the MP's weren't there for great enlargements.

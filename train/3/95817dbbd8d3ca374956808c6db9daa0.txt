Like all horror franchises, at some point we must abandon previous plotlines and just pretend the other films do not exist.
Theres one scene where a character is flogged and tortured while his buddy watches from a window across the street.
Im not saying Inferno does not have its moments.
Hence we have inferno.
As it is, its simply average.
This is classic cenobite punishment.
However, these moments cannot make up for the sense that something is missing here.
Reminds me of Coke and New Coke.
This film could have been a whole lot better if it had some soul.
The lack of cenobite mytholgy here is disheartening.
The DVD format at least makes the film look nice visually.
It does.
so after bloodline, i'm left wondering how they are going to resurrect pinhead this time.
We all know what happened to New Coke.
I suppose this was meant to be somewhat of a new beginning or departure for the series but it does not deliver the goods.

It is a great idea, works great at first, but the major problem is it is not waterproof (or should I say fluid-proof.)
Pee routinely gets on the motor area, which is not protected at all from moisture.
As other posters have mentioned, I have taken apart the fixtures multiple times to clean them out.
We are on our 3rd(!
My cats are normal-sized female cats, spayed, but they cannot keep their pee in the litter area.
on these "free" cats, it pains me to say.
)mega litter box, (and our last!)
Great idea, poor execution.
The motor then quits.
Sometimes I'm successful in getting them to work again, sometimes not.
I love our cats, they can stay, but the stupid, way-too-expensive "automatic" litter box is out!
Lesson hard-learned.
We have 2 cats.
We have wasted over $450!!
I'M DONE!

the writing is just a bad, it sounds like they filmed some of the scenes in a tin box (the police station) and how old is that detective?
The chase scene at the end is great.
did you ever notice that they only have one car in the movie?
Everyone drives the same car!
it's so bad, that you end up liking it!
and he's going out with her?
This movie is ONLY for people who like bad hollywood movies, and i'm not talking about something that just dissapioints you!
Also, the music is the most eerie thing i've ever heard in a movie.
Wow!
And yet, the strange thing about this movie is that once you watch it, you have this strange affinity for it.
The acting is horrible (except for Fuad Ramses's line: "... an Egyptian Feast!!!")
I'm talking about something that is just bad all over the place!
if you enjoy bad movies, this one is definitely for you!
it's always there.
Yikes.

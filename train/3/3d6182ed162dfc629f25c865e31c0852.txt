I'm shocked at all the 4 and 5 star reviews.
But it's the truth.Worst track: Blak Pudd'n3 stars.
And that's the problem with this album.
"Weak" has always been a beautiful song.
It was written by Brian Alexander Morgan who wrote many of the album's songs.
Her voice is always at the forefront and for good reason.
But hey.
"Right Here" (Human Nature Radio Mix) is also amazing.
No two people have the same tastes.The girls can obviously sing.
If you want my opinion, don't get this album just download the singles.
Yes.
I was honestly using the skip button a lot on Spotify.
However, the props mainly go to lead singer Coko.
But between the tracks you obviously have to fast forward through are some great midtempos and ballads.
There was just too many boring upbeat tracks here to hold much interest though.
There's too much new jack swing filler that takes away from the album's charm.
Sad?
The original not so much.

That's the best aspect of the music on this CD.
This album falls short on all accounts, unfortunately.
!
There's gonna be quality, no doubt.
OK, Joe was on a roll from the start in 2001..alas, it has ended.
Why re-record it?
But he can do so much better!
It's still good--hey, it's Joe B!
Come on, Joe!
And what's with the duplicate recording of "Around The Bend"????
Every album heretofore provided a new twist, better songs, better playing, whatever.
He's taking it easy on this CD...well, OK, Joe, enjoy your little breather.
Now get back into the studio and really let it rip next time!!
And like some of his other fans, I wish he would do more straight-ahead blues and play his heart out.
He already recorded that song on one of his earlier albums, and it was fine.
I thought this CD was a little heavy on cover tunes, but one of his own, too?
His tone is KILLER.
But on this album he's just too restrained--boring at times.

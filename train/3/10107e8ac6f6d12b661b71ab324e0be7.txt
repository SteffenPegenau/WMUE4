He ruined the vampire secret and exposed the world about their nature.
Akasha (Aaliyah) wanted him to be her prince.
All of the vampires wanted him dead, except for one.
I'm sure this movie was nothing like the book, I don't know because I haven't read it.
Who cares?
She ruined the Death Valley concert to get to him (good job!
terrible concert!).
The scene where Aaliyah was in a tub full of roses, it was hot!
Considering the element of the movie, I didn't know vampires could sing.
He sounds just like him, it's amazing... After many centuries of absorbing dust, Lestat the vampire finally decided to get out to become a rock singer?
There was one moment though that was memorable.
It was good enough for me.
Bad taste.
Aaliyah fans may be disappointed with the small amount of screen time Aaliyah had.
Now I know rappers aren't the only ones ripping off other artists, for example, Lestat (Stuart Townsend) is ripping off Korn's lead singer, Jonathan Davis.

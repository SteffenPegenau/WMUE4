IT IS NOT TO BAD AN EFFORT.
ON THIS RELEASE THERE IS NOTHING ADDED IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM.
BUT AT LEAST WE CAN BE GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE SOME MORE ELVIS ON DVD.
TYPICAL OF PARAMOUNT, WHO SEEMS TO HAVE A DISDAIN FOR ELVIS.
A CIVIL WAR MELODRAMA.
THIS IS ELVIS' FIRST MOVIE.
HIS ACTING IS AMAZINGLY GOOD FOR BEING AN AMATOUR.
AFTER ALL IT IS A BLACK AND WHITE FILM.
ELVIS LOOKS OUT OF PLACE WITHIN THE STORY-LINE.
JUST A TRAILER.
WHICH IS AWSOME IN OF IT'S SELF.
THE TRANSFER IS CLEAN BUT IT COULD BE BETTER.
PARAMOUNT EVEN PUT A PICTURE ON THE COVER OF ELVIS IN THE 60'S!.
HE SINGS AND MOVES AS ELVIS IN 1956.
JUST SEE WHAT CRITERION DID FOR "THE BANK DICK".
THIS WAS AN HISTORIC MOMENT IN POP CULTURE THAT SHOULD'VE RECEIVED A LITTLE CARE.
HOW LAME IS THAT.?

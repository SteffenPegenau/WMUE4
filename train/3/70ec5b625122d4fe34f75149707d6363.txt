So I say stick to this talent, and save the spirals and acid trip stuff to the other guitar guys who play slower, and can't play as ferociously as you.
Lightning fast fingers that never let up.
Very loud, and loud is good!
Don't you get tired, Joe?
So insane!
What a joke?
Oh yeah, plus they can't whammy like you either.
So too much!
I get tired just watching you blaze on every song.
At least the sound quality of the concert is great.
You are WAAAYYYY faster than other guitar players.
Dizzying.
Just up and down for them.
You rule with your high pitched whammy SCREAMS that sound like rockets shooting thru the sky.
My eyes need a rest.
so I'll give it 3 stars for this alone.
But this band, they just play so FAST.

Although it sure does help when they hit assembly language instructions in chapter 3!That's why it's so confusing when you hit the exercises in the back of each chapter.

The text seems okay for a intro.
into the subject.
and the answers really didn't come from anywhere in the book.
I am sort of in between all the other reviwers on this one.
Where did these come from?
Very little of it can be answered by reading the book, the teacher of my class was only able to answer the questions due to experience outside of the field.
And sorry to anyone required to use this text!
Sorry.
Most of the answers start with "it depends on .
Most of the questions are trick questions and this isn't a way to teach, but it is a way to confuse the reader.
There is enough information to teach a class and I assume it _is_ designed for someone with little to no previous knowledge in computer architecture.
I guess I'm reviewing the book in the same way the book reads.

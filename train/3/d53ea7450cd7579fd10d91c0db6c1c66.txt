But all i do is button smashing.
They block moves in a realistic fasion.
Its so stupid, all of the cars are bouncing around like pimp mobiles.
I like the way the agents were designed.
anyway, its fun for what it is.
(only like jumping off wall and kicking someone).
The focus thing is overrated, helps alot when firing a gun...but their are hardly any special fighting moves that you get with using it.
rent before buying.
And to sit down and try to figure out how to do just this doesn't really work out either.
Not to say that some of it isn't fun.
Its better to get in on consol, even if graphics are better for pc since the game is for hitting buttons.
The driving parts of the game is soo [messed] up.
I really haven't learned how to compine buttons together to make awesome combos that i planned out.
The kung fu moves are the most fluid and realistic i have ever seen.
Not much sniper work involed.

THe Alone remix is simply a classic.
Pick this up if you enjoy well played metal.
The first 9 songs are from the Skydancer album, which was DT debut.
Mikael Stanne takes over vocal duties and more than fills Friden's shoes.
The last 4 songs are amazing.
Classic.
Some might say that it all began with At the Gates(probably the best band ever).
The most surprising thing about this album is the vocals.
Well, look no further.
These songs re well executed with some very excellent tracks.
At the Gates was more thrash/ death metal than melodic death metal.
This CD was the beginning.
Have you ever wondered where the likes of Soilwork, Opeth, In Flames, Arch Enemy, and Children of Bodom got inspiration.
Anders Friden heads up the vocal department(if you've been living in box for the past couple of years, Friden fronts In Flames).
Others are just filler.

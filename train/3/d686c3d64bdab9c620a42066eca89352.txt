go ahead buy it.
Well I gave it 3 stars for graphics and simply the name ZELDA.
the days went by to fast.
don't take my word for it.
then u have to get them all over again.
She was taken by skull kid and you went after her.
what happened to her.
You didn't even get to find out what the true meaning of the game was, which is!
and you lose all the stuff u begin with.
It would be great if the story went like this.
It has great graphics and everything, but what a waste.
This game was great game, I have to admit it.
the story line was boring.
you were transported to another world to save Navi.
you found Navi, but she was trapped.
But always remember, the 2nd game in the series is never the best.
but the rest was a waste of good potential.
Navi.
but not as good as the first.

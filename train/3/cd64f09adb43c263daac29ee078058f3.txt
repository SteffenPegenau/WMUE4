I can't believe 4 songs are edited.
I saw nothing.
I put it in my car and drove off.
Very deceiving and disappointing.
Not that it's bad though.
No option for the unedited CD?
Not here.
Why on earth would her label do this?As for Avril herself, I thought she was coming around to a more mature sound.
I went to the store and picked up a copy of this CD.
But the edit issue is just wrong!
Before I purchased this CD I looked everywhere for a clean or edited label.
What gives?
Then I noticed on the phrase " I'm the mother fing princess" is edited.
After noticing this after just the first 2 songs I turned it off.
Of course I can't return it if they do release an unedited version.
Song one starts out great, catchy and upbeat.

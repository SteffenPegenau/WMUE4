Pump me up, baby!
Now those songs kicked!
You know!!!!
There is no emotion, no feeling, no vitality to this record.
I loved the passion and intensity of the first album.
I want some "ROOOOOAAAAAAAARRRRRR!!!!"
This album is such crap compared to the first one they did.
--Kelly Magovern
Gimme some PASSION again, Jonathan!
Gimme some "Ball Tongue" and some "Clown."
You know what I'm saying?
And why does this recording not come through like the first one.
Word up!
This one is just a bunch of synth garbage.
I felt no energy from this album.

Is it amusing?
Misleading.
Is there a message at the end?
Yes.
Nothing wrong with that, but I hate misleading packaging.
Yes.
But is it this amazing, fantastic, best movie of the year that everyone is saying it is?
Is it entertaining?
A big, fat lie.
Not really.Is it the "feel-good" movie it claims to be on its packaging?
At least it's nowhere near as dishonest as the packaging for "World's Greatest Dad.
And that's a big clue as to what it knows about itself.
You have to be prepared for "depressing".
Yes.
It will not appeal to people who are looking for a feel-good comedy.
No.
See all those people smiling in the photos for this product page?
"Sorry to rain on parades, but I thought fair warning is needed, after seeing all those glowing reviews.
It's an OK movie, and you'll probably enjoy it (as much as such things can be enjoyed).

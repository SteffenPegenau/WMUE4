It is EXTREMELY loud and really can not spin fast enough to work as an actual "pottery wheel".
The tools are nice.
First of all, it takes 4 C batteries.
Add to that, that it is EXTREMELY messy.
The mess afterwards took about 1 hour clean up, as my daughter had clay on her hands and it got everywhere.This is a great gift if you never need to actual participate in helping to make something.
I am thinking of buying one for my sister in law's kids :)
.
so not so great for us.
.
Clay itself is nice.
Mom and aunt needed to deal with the end result .
My 7 YO could somewhat make a cup with the help of her 20 year old aunt.
so grandma felt good about buying a great gift.
The wheel itself is pure junk.
.
Paints are nice.
Now if you can imagine how much power you get from 4 c batteries, that is what you get.
My 7 YO thought it was the coolest thing when she opened it up .

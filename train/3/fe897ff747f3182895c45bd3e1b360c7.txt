It conveys chaos, maybe, but not fear.
What?
The Thin Red Line, despite it's long running time (similar to this film) is much more effective in letting the audience develop a connection with the main characters and in showing why they act.
In this film, they mostly all die offscreen.
How many of them had families?
We Were Soldiers simply shows men getting slaughtered and trying to remain patriotic/hopeful until the end of the flick.
"American Heroes" ... guess that sums it up.
I see the war as a wound we refused to let close.
this movie tries to celebrate the blood spilled in this pointless struggle.
When they're on screen, they usually perish while jumping from a huge explosion.
The Vietnamese commander is about as distant and trivial as possible.
More time is spent trying to establish an emotional connection with the CO's Wife.
And that's where this movie goes wrong.
How many NVA soldiers died horrible, slow, bloody painful deaths?
and what a TERRIBLE score.

none the less, i popped in a couple of pieces of toast and set it for 7 - darkest setting.
i grew more grey hair just waiting for it.
So i pull it out of the box and the sucker is huge.
took for-ev-er.
and all of it gets hot: top, bottom, sides, and especially, the glass door (which should have been a 'duh' but i'm very empirical).
Now I know i saw it at the store, but it was beside other behemoths, so it didn't look as big as it is.
it's very shiny - ooo!
we bought this puppy to replace a very old B&D straight-up, two-slice, toaster oven.
really.
it didn't really fit.
Maybe i'll look at jewelry.
i burned my little fingers.
Judge Wapner, three o'clock.
<<sigh>> so much for my shiny new toy.
it burned the thinner piece, but did a good job of toasting the other.
AND - the d*** thing gets really, really, very hot.
so we're returning the beast.
It's 19.5 inches wide and 14 deep.

.
If, after being paralyzed, Maggie was shown going through the fear, depression, anger, etc.
.
Frankly, this movie has no story, unless one considers life's tragedies to be little more than a prelude to giving up and death.
If Maggie had fought her way to the top in boxing, then used her celebrity and knowledge to help disadvantaged kids .
What is the story in that?
that would be a story.
.
What story is there in a cowardly coach that criminally kills her and then disappears .
.
that comes with such an injury, then finding new meaning in her life when what had been her whole former life had been destroyed .
especially after seeing his priest then knowingly defying the Church?The best I can say is that this is a movie that never reaches its potential.
So what?
It doesn't even make a passable case for euthanasia.
Anyone can give up; many, maybe even most people, do when confronted with major setbacks in life.
.
that would be a story.

"I met my looooooooove at a funeral .
the rhythm and percussion on that song is so cool.

Pretty straight-up songs overall, nothing too wacky or extemely interesting .

Love the spastic breakdown in the middle before the song recovers again.Note: This is coming from the point of view of a fan who really loves UH-OH and the Heads' NAKED, unorthodox views according to many reviewers on this site, so take my opinion with (at least) a grain of salt!

the big exception is "Crash."
For me, "Crash" really stands out.

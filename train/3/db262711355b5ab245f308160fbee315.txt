Even though most of his albums are sub-par beats and production wise and theme wise, Canibus is still a mad tight emcee.
Its way off.
I think his flows about weed and woman are weak, and sometimes he ego trips.
His is an ill rapper who gets no credit or respect.
He would do well to hook up with a tight producer, even a mainstream one.
His lyricaL flow is sometimes amazing, sometimes so-so.
The tightest track are: 33 3's,Gybaotic,Mind control, Last laugh, the rest are all right, some are forgetable.
Mind control is still pretty tight.
Its always hit or miss with this guy.
I would still recommend any canibus album to rock at least a few times.
But I like this album better than hip hop for sale.
His themes are okay, they have never really been that great, but they allright.
He is hell bent on ripping emcees and being angry, and that's cool, but he needs more.
It's just his direction.
If he stays true to his lyrical skill he can never sell out.

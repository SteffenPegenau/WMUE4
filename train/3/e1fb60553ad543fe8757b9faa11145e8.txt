Watch is just like it looks on the screen.
I was scared it might damage it if I pulled too hard.
It actually measures 37mm from the winding dial edge to the opposite edge.
?
However, I don't know where the measurement thing came from.
I didn't like that as careful as I tried, it still left an indentation on the edges.
Where is the middle position??
It's much easier if the right instructions are in the package.
Only takes half an hour to adjust the time.
I knew this upon purchase.
I've had timexs before and yeah it takes a licking but keeps on ticking.
However, I did have a jewelry needle nose plyer in the house.
Smaller than I wanted.
The flex band was not very difficult to adjust.
I bought this as a gift for my daughter so the band is too big.
The '3-position crown' is not easy to adjust.

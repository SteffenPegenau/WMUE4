Yes, and then I fear it will be hilarious.
There's a breathy little girl singer in here, who can occasionally summon some power and tinkle on the piano on some catchy numbers.
Slllick.
You bet.
Good product?
That about sums it up.
There is a photo in this album's booklet of the artist herself sitting lost and bewildered on the studio floor while behind her, handlers put what looks like a 60-piece orchestra through their paces.
Great music?
Then, the expensive producers take it and make it very digital and very slick while the hollywood strings punctuate right along.
Soon to be dated?
Pro tools slick.
Um, well... it's so slick it might slip out of my memory like butter.
And hey, at least it isn't obscene filth like much of this kind of thing is these days.
Digital slick.
But it's fun for now.

I would recomend this book to people who have a lot of patience.
What I disliked was the detail that the author went into.
It good to go into detail, but not so much were the reader has trouble understanding.
What I liked about this book was the dialogue.
He may have introduced too many too soon.
It made it feel like you were actually there having a conversation with the characters.
I liked the book, but it wasn't one of my favorites.
It was how a black man was convicted for something that no one could prove he did.
It you dont like it at first, give it a chance.
I also liked the plot of the story.
You may have to reread some parts to fully understand it.
Overall I think this book is a good one.
I found it hard to find out what characters he was talking about sometimes.
You might like it after all!

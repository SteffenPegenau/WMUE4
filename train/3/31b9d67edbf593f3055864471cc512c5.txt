To each is own.I need a wall calendar with glossy photos and great info about the show...that's just me.
I swear I haven't even used the calendar after a couple of weeks.Get it if you're a fan and you really wanna know what's it like to have this product.
The calendar has so much information it's not even funny.
But the fact that it's a desk calendar is not so great.
That they should make.
First of all I love CSI.
And the way it looks is disappointing.
Like whoever put it together didn't give it much thought.
So when I ordered this calendar I thought I was going to get a wall calendar.
It looks and feels cheap.
Every day of the week it has new facts about the show and the world of CSI.
That's fun, I like that.
Instead I got a desk calendar.
I don't like having to tear off the next page to reveal the next day.
Or better yet see what it looks like in a store before buying it.

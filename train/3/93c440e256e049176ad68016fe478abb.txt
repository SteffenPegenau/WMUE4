But thats all it was... cute and sweet.
If you can get it on CD.
Its a sweet book.
And the story was sweet.
I read alot of young adult books.
But its not the amazing piece of literature that people are making it out to be.
I was happy to see it was honored by the Newberry Awards, as that usually leads to an unusually good book.
If you read it, you will be entertained.
So when it was recommended to me by several people to read this AMAZING book called "Pictures of Hollis Woods" I was more than happy to find a copy.
I was very dissapointed considering how much praise I had heard about this book, it didnt seem to deserve it.Dont skip it.
If you dont, it wouldnt be a tragedy.
The characters were cute.
It was well written.
However, I felt that this story was rather lack luster.
The reader was excellent.

For the ladies that thought they'd finally have a hot guy to workout with...
You can combine them when you get stronger.
I'm really happy with my purchase.
And the music is a bit outdated and silly too.
haha.
Stick with it and get more like it if you get bored with the same old easily.
It's nice that there are 5 days of workouts.
This dvd is truley an awesome ab workout.
And I do.
These things don't bother me though as long as I get what I wanted out of it, which is a great ab workout!
It's a scam.
Here are the reasons that I didn't give it a full 5 stars... You have to fast forward to get to the other workouts.
The guy on the cover shows you how to start a position and then you workout with a group of people... he doesnt even join them.
Anyhow overall this was sooo worth the money!
Also the people look silly in their swimsuit/tights get up with ankle socks.
You cant just "skip" because it's not an option.

Should be a simple fix.
Excellent built-in security.
Configuration is amazingly easy.Mine came directly from Sonicwall with a screw loose inside the case.
I have mine setup in a site-to-site VPN configuration between a remote office and a primary local site.
If you get one in good condition, you won't be disappointed.
I went round and round with them just to send me the product I paid for.
3 stars overall.
It wasn't simple.
Even Cisco isn't this hard to deal with.
I've been very pleased with this device.
Consider extending the warranty to have access to upgraded software.
1 star for the support under warranty.
Instructions are simple.
They send me a replacement overnight to replace their damaged product.
I finally have my replacement but getting them to fix their manufacturing error wasn't what it should have been.5 stars for the product.
It was like pulling teeth.

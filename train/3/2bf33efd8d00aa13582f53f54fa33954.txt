However it does fit and is correct for the vehicle according to Hayden.
I purchased the Hayden 2671 fan clutch from Amazon because they had the best price by far and it is a name brand product not a generic.
I am installing it on my 2001 Toyota Tacoma v6.
I hope that means it is better made than it appears.
It seems to be very light duty.
I buy a part for a japanese vehicle and it is made here.
The description from Hayden states OE fit and appearance etc..
I have my doubts about it's longevity.
Time will tell and I hope I am wrong.
Also I wanted to mention that it is Made In The USA.
The original lasted 141,000 miles and I will be very surprised if this lasts half as long.
Nowhere near as beefy and as heavy duty appearing as the original.
How ironic.
It is lighter and smaller than the OE.
Go figure.

Did I mention these headphones are huge?
My husband kept telling me to turn the volume down.
They are going back.
My mistake.
Wow.
As I mentioned, the sound is great.
No doubt the large size helps produce/enables this sound.
They are light and comfortable so if you don't mind looking like an idiot you may not be bothered by the size.
I've never seen such big headphones.
They take up both sides of my head.
I wish I had checked the size before ordering.
These things are huge.
Still, I can't get over the how big they are.
P.S.
Sound is great but they are just too big.
Contrary to another reviewer, these headphones are definitely noisy to others nearby.
Just received my headphones.

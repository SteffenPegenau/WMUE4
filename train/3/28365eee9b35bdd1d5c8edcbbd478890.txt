There is a bad point though....the time element.I've noticed a lot of film are overdone!
Can't you see that's not what they wanted to do with this film.
Around the two hour mark I was waiting for the film to end.
ARE YOU BLIND!
Each film had it's own agenda!
While this film wanted to make a poetic statement.Everyone is saying the film wasn't REAL enough!
People have been comparing "Saving Private Ryan" to this film.
Ryan true was probably more realistic.
I just couldn't take it anymore!
I saw that Malick was getting over indulgent.The film was taking on more then it could handle.
And in many cases a BORING one!
But still a film people should see.
An all star cast and a great novel make "The Thin Red Line" the unique film it is.
WHY?
Maybe they feel if they make the movie long they have a epic masterpiece on their hands.What they don't realize is all they have IS A LONG MOVIE!

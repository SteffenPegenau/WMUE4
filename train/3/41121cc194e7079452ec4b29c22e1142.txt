The laser was replaced.
Okay..I rented another one.
I think'll need to lay out some extra $$$ for a quality DVD player.
After about 3 months I took it to be repaired.
Same thing.
When it works the picture is great, the sound is great.
It was a Christmas present in 2000.
Now I am getting distortion on DVDs that I own that played all the way without a blip the first two or three times.
It would not load.
I do not play DVDs constantly.
Fine..that was on Samsung.
Plus, it is short enough to fit in the space above my VCR.
It has features that I would never use.
Now about 3 months later it has started again.
Maybe one or two a week, so overuse is not a problem.
I noticed scratches on the disc.
Within days I had the skip/distortion/freeze up problems like I see so many others have had.
So in a nutshell you could get one that works properly, but you may get a bad one.
First off this is my first DVD player.
It started about 2 weeks ago when I rented "Unbreakable."

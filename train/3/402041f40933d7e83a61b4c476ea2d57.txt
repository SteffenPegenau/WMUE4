So, mile 3 is a big disappointment.
I am relatively new to Leslie Sansone WAH series.
it's more comfortable than i expected too.
*Didn't care for the interaction b/n cast, espec the whole water and towel bit.
This was my 3rd purchase.
Yes b/c it adds more variety to my at home dvd collection.
I want 3 intense miles and then a cool down.
They should have stopped taping or done it more than once and edited it better.
*Like that it's 3 miles--so it can be a short day for me.
Could have incorporated it better.
*Don't like that she hardly uses the belt.
I don't mind Leslie's chatter but this aspect was annoying.Would I still buy it?
*Like Leslie and her upbeat personality*Don't like that mile 3 is too low in intensity.
it's like all of mile 3 is cool down.
*Like using the walk belt.
I was really looking forward to more resistance work and whe barely had us use the belt.
I LOVE LOVE the 5mile fat burning DVD.

But other than that, this book was so so.
There were so many times when I found the book would make me drop to sleep.
But I must agree with other people who have read this book.
I really thought this book would be one that I wouldn't be able to put down.
but from there on, it just isn't all that great.
Boy was I wrong.
That just proves that people really shouldn't judge books by thier cover or author.
It really isn't meant for people under 14 or 15.
I just wish I didn't have to force myself to keep reading.
the end however, is very cute.
However, to be on the positive side, when a man tells his story about Briar Rose in the book, it get's very interesting.
I found this book to be quite boring (especially in the beginning).
I also thought I would finish it in like, 3 days.
I really expected more from this author.
I bet it's really good!"
When I bought this book, I figured, "Oh, it's by Jane Yolen.
Some of the content is very disturbing.

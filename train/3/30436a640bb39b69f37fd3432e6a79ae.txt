It takes some time to put together and you have tO be careful cause it will break.
They had all kinds of beds, with dressers for under $600.
I would suggest looking for a rooms to go outlet.
My mom bought it then decided it was too big for her room so I got it at a discount :).
It will probably break if you do.
If u plan to stay in one place for awhile it's a pretty good, but if you move alot I wouldn't recommend it.
The grit braces of the headboard (sold seperatly) didn't gO all the way to the floor so it will only fit snug against the wall with the bed against it.
First off you have to understand this is boxed furniture like Ikea or Walmart.
All in all it's just ok.
It hold the bed great though.
And that stuff will last.
It was hard to get the drawers to line back up, but it did eventually after some tweaking.
It is all plywood type material.
It won't disassemble and reassemble easily.
But I didn't fully disassemble it and loaded it on a truck to get it home.

I can't begin to imagine the horror of it.
I was not aware of a 2nd atomic bomb being detonated in Japan.
This one not in Hiroshima.
The flash burns, some with flesh pulling off.
Got to wonder how much of this radiation is in our drinking water and soil, none of which was contained at the test sites I'm sure as waters do flow to other sites.
No wonder it took the United States so long to help the Jews during the holocaust that claimed so many lives.
It does not detail that event.
Eyes hollowed out.
"Hiroshima" follows the lives of a handful of people that survived the A-Bomb.
Fires.
Thirsty but barely able to open their mouths to take in water.
Vomiting.
They were too busy in their own version of the American holocaust against Japan.This book mentions a second atomic bomb that was dropped on Japan.
Just mere mention.
Toward the end of the book, it accounts various bomb-test sites of both atom bombs and hydrogen bombs and the testing countries.

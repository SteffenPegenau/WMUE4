And you're still sitting there chewing on that first handful of popcorn.
Imagine this: you buy a ticket to a movie made by one of your favorite directors, costs you 22 bucks, you fork out money for popcorn, a coke, some granola bars - or whatever - and you came super early to get the best seat in the theater.
Haven't even touched your coke.
Maybe not.
Maybe one of his best.
It all happened so fast, it was hard to tell.
A plot starts to unfold.
You're out of money and here they come already, Hoovering up the aisle...
It's looking like a really great piece of work.
What flashed before your eyes was maybe some the greatest 16 seconds of film you've ever seen in your life.
The lights go up and everyone leaves.
But one thing's for sure: you're out of money.
Very quickly the place fills up, the lights go down and the movie begins.
But the movie ends.
Your seat hasn't even warmed up yet.

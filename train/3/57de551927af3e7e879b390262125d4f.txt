The flashlight is very handy and utilitarian.
The head should not twist so easily as it does.
I like the reliability.
For the price, it's worth every penny.
It's a waste of batteries.
It's bright for the size, especially in total darkness and you can adjust the beam.
It was after a few hours that I noticed.
I must have dropped it several times on a concrete and no problems whatsoever.
Many, many times the head twisted making the light come on.
Now, here's one problem that I have with it.
Other than that, this flashlight is excellent and the quality and materials are superb and it's made in usa.
I I usually carry this flashlight on my belt (under my clothes) in the nylon sheath it came with.
It's tough, water resistant, etc..
If you don't plan on carrying it in the sheath then this shouldn't be an issue, still maglite should solve this problem.
Nice feature and so is the candle mode.

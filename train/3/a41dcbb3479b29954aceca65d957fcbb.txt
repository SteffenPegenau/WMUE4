Is it worth the astronomical cost for replacement blades?
LOTS of little bits of stubble the so called "advanced" Fusion left.Is it a good razor?
AFTER shaving with the fusion.
Results?
No way!
Yes.
Not really.
I tried it.
It does provide a close shave, with little irritation, even going against the grain.
Cons: It is no better than a Sensor Excel, Mach 3, etc.
Pros first.
Is it better than competitors?
Blades cost a FORTUNE (won't be buying any) and, regarding their claim that it will provide the closest shave ever- after shaving with it I stropped up (that is, sharpened) my straight razor, something I use perhaps once a year for kicks, and shaved with that.
Gillette sent me one as a promo.
Rather than rinse the lather off the razor, I wiped it on a white cloth.

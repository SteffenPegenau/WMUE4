I have to say I like the Mintek a lot more.
The VHS player is very good and has not given any problems.
It really has never given us any technological problems.
The Mintek is able to play ALL data, most video, and even a PAL DVD from Italy.
This Sony Combo is very picky on what DVD's I put!
But I am saddened to see that Sony dosen't allow so many kinds of DVD's.
:(.
Around the same time, we had bought two DVD players, a Mintek ($40) and this Sony ($200.)
Although, the reliablility level is very good.
Also, we have had experiences when this DVD would freeze in between parts of movies.It does play DATA MP3 CD.
Thanks and God Bless.
But the Sony, which costs way too much more, is not even able to play any of that.
If you are someone who watches only DVD's and VHS, than this is for you.
I would reccomend this to someone who dosen't use data CD's with , AVI or any type of media file.Also its good for DVD's which are either WORLD or NTSC region.
(Which thats a good feature.)

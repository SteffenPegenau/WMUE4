One more thing, someone mention that the can is a little small, just get a 13 gallon instead of a 10.
I have love all of my Oxo kitchen products, except this trash can.
If tried putting rubber no-skid mats under it, didn't help.
I contribute this is the brushed steel.
This is one very pricey trash can, so I expect it to be just short of perfect.
I've owned this trash can for over a year and haven't had any rust spots like other reviews mentioned.
So, it is being replaced.
2 other issues with the can - 1.
Finger prints, dog nose prints and every little drip shows.
It always looks dirty.
2.
In my last house it annoyed me, but we just moved into a new house and it is scuffing up the wall.
You really have to get the bag tight around the top of the liner or it slips out of the mechanism that holds the can in place.
My biggest complaint is that it slides backwards every time you use the foot pedal.
I don't like to have to dig the bag out of the can.

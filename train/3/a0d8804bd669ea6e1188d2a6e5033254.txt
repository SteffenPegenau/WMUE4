These shoes are a bargain.
These shoes are better than I thought.
They are super comfy too.
I just purchased these shoes needing a replacement for the Bostonians that I have been wearing for more than a year now.
They can pass for dress shoes alright.
I do like their comfortable sole and the rubber has much better traction and less noise than the leather soles I am used to.
They fit well but don't allow much breathing and my foot got really overheated.
They still look kind of cheap, but have held up really well for 8 months now.
I have only worn them once so I can not attest to durability, but I would doubt that these last more than a few months and I am curious as to how well these will respond to shoe polish.Update 12-14-10.
They look cheap compared to the shoes I am used to wearing.
I think owe Stacy Adams an apology.
They look a lot better in the picture than in person.
I am on a budget and didn't want to shell out too much money for a pair of shoes.
OK.
I am sorry.

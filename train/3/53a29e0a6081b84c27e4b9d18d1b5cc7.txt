This one, while it might appear to be otherwise, is not for everyone.
The jokes are offensive and many gags are not for the squeamish.
Obviously, Waters' movies are not for everybody.
Dear old mom is a murdering psychopath!!.
Did you expect anything less from John Waters?.
This oddball film is no exception.
I think that pretty much says everything.
You hear that, you know your not gonna get a normal, sane movie.
This is a John Waters film.
The movie is twisted and hilariously demented.
I think you will too.
If not, then you get a great performance by Turner, who hasn't been this good in eons.
You wear white after Labor Day, your in big trouble.
Not by a long shot.
Kathleen Turner delivers a knockout performance as a suburban housewife with a great husband and family(Sam Waterston, Ricki Lake, Matthew "Scream" Lillard).
But, this happy homemaker is no Mrs. Brady.
Many scenes I exploded in laughter.

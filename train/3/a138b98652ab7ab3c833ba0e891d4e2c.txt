For those of you with a short attention span, & little or no imagination, stick with the Kubrick version.
If you enjoy reading, do read the book.
Best of all, read the book, & watch both movies.
For true Stephen King fans, the Kubrick film is a pale shadow loosely based on the novel.
While I am a huge fan of Jack Nicholson, the movie quickly degenerates into a too long chase scene with Shelly Duvall screaming shrilly & constantly.
This is a great horror movie for those of you who accept hack & slash tactics as scary.
Of course, for a proper rebuttal, all 3 must be compared.
Unfortunate, but true.
Make up your own minds.
Even the made for TV series,(while much more satisfactory), is not quite the same.
Only fair you know.....BS
Totaly helpless, in spite of the fact her child's life is in danger.
Any attempt to follow the book is lost at this point.
It's right up your alley.
There comes a point where you have to cut something, & sacrifices are necessary.

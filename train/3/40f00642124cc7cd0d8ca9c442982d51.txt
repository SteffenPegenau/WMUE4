I played it for about 12 hours total.
The game seemed to be building to a decent story albeit not that original, but that didn't bother me.
That's it.
A little too much for me.
I played this game over a weekend.
This game is too similar.
It seemed that after every other battle they were introducting a new aspect.
I didn't think the linearity issue would be that big, but it was indeed a huge detriment to this game.
Your imaginary character would be "pushed" down a "rail" and you had to shoot your targets.
It's much different.
When I was growing up we had games that we classified as "on-rail" shooters.
You're pushed down a single path and battle enemies.
Obviously I didn't play the WHOLE thing.
There was no exploratory aspect whatsoever.
This isn't the Final Fantasy I grew up with.
The battle system was extremly in-depth.
Perhaps Square should consider going back to their roots next time.

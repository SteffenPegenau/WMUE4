Then I dont really think you are a Son Volt fan!
But if you can tell me that this rates right up there with the first 3 Son Volt cd's?
Let the flamers begin!!
I think you might be a huge Jay Farrar fan.
I just hope if I wait another 7 years, That I get something a little better then this.
Besides Jay being the only original member, Where is all that great pedal steel guitar?
I'm getting old!
I'm sorry, but thats how I feel.
Thanks to all.
(Thats great) But you are not a Son Volt fan.
I tried my best to love this cd.But I can not.
I think it's a Jay Farrar solo cd & they decided to use the Son Volt name to sell a few more copies.
I waited 7 years for this.
But I'm not deaf yet.
I'm sorry folks.

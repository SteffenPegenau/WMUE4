ANyway, if anything, download O Holy Night.
But I bought the entire album and honestly I had trouble with most of her other renditions of American favorite Christmas Chorals.
I found myself thinking come on Mahalia .
.
.
.
.
Her O Holy Night is one of the best I've heard.
.
speed it up .
get it going.
Some she and the band just didn't seem to get the right tempo.
She does it the best I've heard.
Same slow awkward tempo.
And maybe the digital enhancement made it audible but sometimes Mahalia appeared to have an African American accent or lisp or something that sounded a little odd and distracted me from the song.
But throughout the entire song she didn't.
.
come on.

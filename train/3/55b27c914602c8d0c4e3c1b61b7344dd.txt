It has it's moments, but there aren't enough of them.
It's okay, not great.
Sometimes the movie is a little fun & kinda sweet.
Maybe an R-rated one, as this is PG-13.
However there is rarely any heat generated between him & Messing.
As he is paid to do, being a hired man.
I liked the subplot concerning her little sister (who's the one getting married).
Dermot Mulrooney is hot (as usual) as are some of the british male cast.
There's actually a scene with them in the bathroom where he's naked & she's not.
I supposed they are supposed to be awkward or something, but it really falls flat.
He says & does the right things.
This is a so so movie.
I think I saw sparks between them in one scene & that's all.
A rental, not a purchase.
The british friend is very brash & althought sometimes funny she almost seems to belong in another movie.

[3] Recovery CD's: Doesn't ship on a different CD.
Its hard to understand them.
I would say chaos.
Don't forget to remind that you aren't their client for product enquiry.If you can afford few bucks more:[1]buy one with Intel Motherboard.
The spec seemed amazing from price-performance.Here is my opinion:[1] DVD Full Screen playback - excellent.
Recently bought S5400NX.
Be prepared to give your contact info, even for product enquiry.
[6] The above two points might be because of the ASUS technology(mother board and CDROM drives).
Worked fine with Arcsoft's ShowBiz (shipped), Which is again very minimal version.
[5] CDROM Noise: access to CDROM makes noise.
[7] Support: International support center.
You can copy it to a DVD, But only once lifetime.
[4] Mouse freeze: When you install any software, the cpu shows 100% and the mouse freezes.
Uses disk partition.
Takes sometime for mouse release.
[2] DVD burning: Failed many times with DvdToCopy.
Flawless.
[2]buy one with DVD+/-RW support.

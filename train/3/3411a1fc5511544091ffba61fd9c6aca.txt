There is pretty-sounding keyboard playing throughout.
"Dreams of Freedom" is beautiful and soothing and one of my favorite instrumentals in general.
The talents of guitarist Howe and keyboardist Sutin combine to make this piece of work a pleasant listening journey.
It is a recommendable piece of work.
Words to describe this album would be smooth, elegant, serene, soaring, ethereal, and relaxing.
The music is in a New Age musical direction.
Even though I like all of the pieces, my favorite composition is "Dreams of Freedom."
The disc is just over 45 minutes.
The sound quality is nice.
Also, there are no vocals, but there is percussion work.
Actually, I rate Voyagers 3.5 stars.
Howe provides tasteful, soaring guitar work on "Telepathy."
Voyagers consists of ten tracks.
Voyagers--from Steve Howe/Paul Sutin--was originally released in 1995.
"Sonar Call" furnishes keyboarding that is enveloping and graceful.

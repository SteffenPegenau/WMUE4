This movie pretty much stains the names of horror flicks everywhere!
And the whole sex appeal thing?
It has it's ups and downs.
It's an okay movie.
No disrespect to the people who liked the movie.
If not go see it anyway.
If you like all that teenage, kinky sex thing.. go see this movie.
If you wanted a one line summary you got it.
And the way they changed his mask... DOWN-RIGHT DISGRACEFUL TO US DEVOTED FANS!!
But really, think about it.
There were some good parts.
Jamie, I'm sorry but your movie (NOT MOVIE'S!!
I don't want to give it away...!!
And the ending..
HE HAS EVEN BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN I THOUGHT!!!
That preety much ruined it for younger veiwers.
)just didn't get me goin' the way the did long ago.

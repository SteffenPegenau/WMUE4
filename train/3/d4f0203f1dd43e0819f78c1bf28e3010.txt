It was scary...
But a Lot of unexplained stuff.
I totally could watch this by Myself, and be Okay.
I LIKE the Video On Demand!
Good Job AMAZON!
Probably was better on BIg screen- I saw it via VIDEO On Demand/TIVO.
Blockbuster is $4.99 to rent, and this was $3.99 and I Had it downloaded in under and hour.. and never had to leave the house.
Second Of all the reviews I saw Of this said "dont watch it alone".. etc.
Live Tyler is GREAT in it.
!
But not that scary and sometimes predictable.
It leaves You Hanging.
First Of all the Movie is Very DARK.. You cant see anything.
Worth the price though.
I will rent more movies.
Why dont they use more Lighting?

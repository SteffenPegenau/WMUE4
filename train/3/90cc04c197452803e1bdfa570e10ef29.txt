Boring ballads about love.
She has some awesome dance tracks.
However, the rest of the album is filler.
Shes right there with JLO and Ashanti.
Upbeat dance tracks that will make you move.
Christina Milian doesn't have the best of voices.
Peanut Butter and Jelly, while a silly title, is still hot.
I do like Christina Milian.
Girls who can kind of sing, so when she tries to sing ballads, her voice is very thin and breathy and makes some of the songs unlistenable.
Its fun, and one of those tracks you always gotta dance too.
One is her sexy, funky side.
It would help if they were at least good songs.
First single Dip it Low is hot, sexy, and undeniably catcy.
Second single Whatever You Want is even better.
The other is sexy and boring.
Her dance tracks are killer.
Christina Milian has 2 styles on her album It's About Time.
She just needs to stick with those and forget those boring, droppy ballads.

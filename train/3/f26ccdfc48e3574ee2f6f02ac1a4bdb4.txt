It was almost as if the story didn't have a plot!
That was the plot.
I didn't like it.
She clearly has potential, she just needs a better story line to work on!
However, I did skip through some pages of pure non sense blabbering.
This book was an ALRIGHT one.
There were too many characters.
It wasn't a horrible book, but it surely isn't one I would recommend to spend your hard earned money on.
This book is seriously over hyped.
It was just running on whatever.
No build up or background as to who they were really or how they built their relationship.
I do commend Teri woods 3 stars for a great effort.
Quadir and Gena fell in love overnight..he bought her lots of nice things, took her out alot and ran the streets.
I Don't recommend this book.
I read alot of books and some which are great and some which are alright and those that I don't finish reading.

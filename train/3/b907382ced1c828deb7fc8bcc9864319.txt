2.You usually have to wait a day to find out what your song is.
4.You have to lesten to 1 station.
5.Sometimes, Sony won't have the song you want.
This is a lot worse than it sounds.
3.The "mark" button is very easy to get pressed while in your pocket.
Make sure to check this before you buy this.
Without this you can't know what song you marked.
3.Very compact-fits in your pocket well.The Cons!
1.Long battery life 2.Again, it's a really good idea.
Bye!Bradley
It broke after 2 weeks.
If you do not install the Emarker in the order the instructions say to, you will have some major problems!Overall....I think you should wait for a new and better model.
1.The keychain is low quality.
6.Only some of the songs have clips so you can recognize your song.
7.There are many stations you can't choose to have as your station.

8.Major Problem!
The Sony Emarker is a good idea, but it needs some flaws worked out first.
But first, the Pros.

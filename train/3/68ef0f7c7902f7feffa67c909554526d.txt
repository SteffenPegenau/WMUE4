After seeing the first NOES, I was eager to see the sequel.
Although the ending is weak, if you understood the plot it's possible for part three, because he never actually took form in the real world-his actions were Jesse's.
Although a little slow moving in the beginning, it picks up soon enough, gotta let the plot develop.
Dark and gloomy atmosphere surrounds the movie, which is good.
The best scene is at the "party".
After reading all the reviews here on Amazon.com, I was a little hasty to watch it cause there's nothing worse than a bad horror movie!
Effects are good for its time, even today.
But this movie is seriously good, not classic.
Killing scenes are good and different, a bit.
The only real disappiontment was the ending.
I could rewatch it many times as well.
The plot is pretty good not just a rehash of the original.
Freddy says some cracks and dialogue.
I even laughed more than once.
Not a classic (never really tried to be one, it's not the worst Freddy.

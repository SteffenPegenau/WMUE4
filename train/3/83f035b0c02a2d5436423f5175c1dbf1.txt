5starz, ez!
This isn't a bad show.
Jaded heads will talk about how phish peaked, and it's been all downhill ever since 90/93/95/97/Big Cypress.
2nd set starts well.
Buy it for Moma and the first 45 minutes of set II.
Thought about going for 1 star to counteract all the mindless 5-star [cough] reviews [cough] on this page.Here's the rundown.
46 Days > Possum, Oh Kee Pah > Suzy are all strong, without too many strey notes.
The encore is brutal.Recommendation:Ignore the hype; this is not "the one."
Aside from "Dinner," the first 45 minutes are mostly forgettable.
But it isn't a particularly good one, either.
Whatever.Truth, as always, is in the middle.
The first set is hit or miss.
Fanboys and girls will eat it up.
Maze, Fankenstein are hollow shells of their former selves.
From that point on, though, it's fairly disappointing as several would-be climaxes fizzle, failing to live up to potential.
Moma>Free is a genuine highlight.

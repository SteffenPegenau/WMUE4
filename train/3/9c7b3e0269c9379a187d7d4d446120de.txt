Then it started hanging up in the feed dog.
I think I'll get another KENMORE!
I'm going to put it in the shop.
Have a good Day All.
The first few months it was a beautiful thing.
I'd be sewing along on a beautiful embroidery piece, then next thing you know it's hanging up and making a mess of your embroidery.
I'm fifty-seven now.
Quite frustrating!!!!!
!I guess mine was made on a Friday or the end of a month.
It just doesn't do embroidery.It was given to me when I was nineteen years old.
Then I'm going to give it away and buy something else.
I checked the needle, feedog,thread.
I checked the bobbin casing, I don't see amy thing wrong with it, other than every time I get into a project, it hangs up.
I Do have a Kenmore Sewing machine that was one of the first ZigZag models.
I sure have a lemon.
That thing will sew through anything.

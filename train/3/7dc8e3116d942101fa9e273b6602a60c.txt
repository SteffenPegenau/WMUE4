Only the songs that that sound less computer generated, and more insturmental really shine.
Full moon tries so hard to impress, but fails.
while this formula is less than successfull on the fast paced jams, it's even worst on the ballads.
Full moon is to electronically driven.
Slightly.
Then somewhere down the line it loses it's touch.
I won't lie, Full Moon is very appealing.
Halfway through the third song i felt dissappointed, and annoyed.
Brandy inlisted Rodney Jerkins to produce most of this album, and that was a mistake.
There's something about the songs that draw you in, feel you with confidence that this is going to be a great ablum.
Is that a bad thing?
No.
The machine created beats fail to trully offer a level of funk that you'd expect.
Is this album bad?
It's sad.
Gone are the innocent, slightly funky, always enjoyable songs of Brandys past efforts.
Now we hear a more mature, grownup woman.
Full Moon offers few good tracks, and much useless garbage.

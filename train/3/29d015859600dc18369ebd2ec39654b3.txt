Needless to say right now we've given up and I will be calling customer service tomorrow.
"turn it off".
The side that requires 4 batteries does not slide out.
She was afraid of it yesterday when we gave it to her.
When we were showing my in-laws it got stuck and kept shaking all over the floor.
Yeah Right!
Other than that it was fun for the adults while it lasted.
Today she's gotten a little bit better.
We got a kick out of it, but the batteries died.
We've spent 2 hours trying to replace the batteries on Elmo's left foot.
So after 1 day of play we need to replace them.
I got this for our 2 1/2 year old.
No problem!
She kept saying.
We've used screw drivers and everything to get them out.
That's why I'm only giving 3 stars because I can only change the batteries in 1 foot and not both, and for such a short life span.

I think it would be more at home as a 45 minute episode of "The Twilight Zone".
We want answers...at least for the key elements.
It's not really a horror movie though.
Obviously cost was a factor as the evil-doers are essentially shadows that take the human form, but leave their clothes.
We want facts.
It is also fraught with questions, none of which are answered.
I fear it won't have much of an audience.
I suspect the filmmakers would say something like, "it's up to the viewer to decide".
I caught this on HDNet about the same time it was released in a limited number of theaters.
"Vanishing" is yet another take on Armageddon with more than a strong hint of religious overtones.
This leads to frustration.
Baloney!
Light, real or artificial, can save you.
In spite of more questions than answers, the movie has its share of tension and spookiness.
Still, in the city of Detroit, only 4 or 5 people have survived, but who knows.

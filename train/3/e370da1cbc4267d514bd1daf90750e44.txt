Not to mention Massie ended every sentence Cordelia said with much.
Poor writing much?
I'm writing a Buffy novel at this time, and I find Oz to be the easiest character to pinpoint.
(Giles is the hardest because of his depth) Also, Cordelia does NOT hang out with the slayerettes.
Come on authors, short responses, doesn't talk much, lacking in exclamation marks.
So very not cool much?
Rude much?
'Nuf said...
Can you say never?
Oz isn't that hard of a character to get down.
I don't think so much?
The characters were all out of character (even when they were under the 'influence').
Come on, when have you ever seen Cordy come running to Buffy practically shreiking for assistance in her problems?
Can you believe that much?
Oz talked too much.
Even in the third season (this is the point the book took place) she totally ignored Buffy and her friends.

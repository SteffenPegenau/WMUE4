I gave this book 3 stars.
That there is hope out there.
Sixteen, with the world at her fingertips.
She tells of the adults who refuse to see the truth, because they are not strong enough to handle it.
This book is a one day read.
This story is told by a friend of Lisa's, Besty.
So, if you like 'journals', read this book and jump into the life of Lisa.
She's going slowly insane, but no one will listen to her pleas.
Books like this one are, "It Happened to Nancy", or "Go ask Alice."
A good book for teenagers who may have a friend or who are that friend that needs help.
A story about Lisa.
She tells of how Lisa's little group of friends do everything to help her.
It captures you, none the less, because of the characters.
This book is written in that tradition.
The conclusion to this story gives a ray of hope.
I was interested in the story, but it was short and sometimes too wordy.

Yes.
Depressing?
Well written?
Anyway, I don't hate Beth.
I think I lost a little interest in the book after they found out what happened to Ben.
A good read and I don't regret it.
I can't say I could be strong for my other children either so I can't judge her.
But as a mother, I feel it worthy to know about the horrors of the world so I read and become more aware to the point of paranoid at times.
Yes.
You can't blame a child for these things but as he got older he should have tried to be more understanding of his parent's heartache.
It got a little boring to me.
And Reese just pissed me off.
I don't think I could survive a child of mine being taken.
This story truly is every mothers worst nightmare.
The mistake she made could be anyone's.

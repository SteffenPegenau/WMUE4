It has it's flaws, like every other movie.
Natelie Portman did a fair job.
Ewan Mcgregor is very good at his part.
Over all this is a prety good movie.
This is an okay movie.
In my oppinoin Episode 2 is better.
Neither is the acting.
But Jake Lloyd?
But come on, it can't be exactly the same, when it is baseddecades earlyer.
The story is not the best in the world.
Still, I think some of the acters did very well.
( She is much better in episode 2.)
The dark side has not completly formed yet, sothis movie can't be as entertaining as the old ones.
I never liked his acting from the first time I saw Jingle all the Way, much less in a Star Wars movie.
Jar-Jar Binks is very annoying!I think him, and Jake Lloyd ruined the movie.I think people were ecxpecting this to be more like the old ones.

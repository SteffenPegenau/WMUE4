Just to see if it was better than the globe design that I had had for 3 years.
This design was alright, but I really like the Artesian Globe design the best.
I probably would not purchase this design again.
But it doesn't quite come out like the picture.
First, it splashed water all the time.
My cat actually drank from this one, like she did the globe design, but this one had some problems.
I reviewed it as well.
I could never get mine to sit square on the bottom--it always tilted a little.
I bought this tabletop fountain at the same time I bought the Artesian Globe water fountain.
It needs some kind of mechanism to hold the tower down to the base.
This one has a great picture and looks really cool.
Third, putting it together was a new experience.
And it is hard to get the base of the rock tower to sit perfectly into the bottom.
A couple of times the cat was drinking from it and it toppled.
Second, I had to add water to it every day.

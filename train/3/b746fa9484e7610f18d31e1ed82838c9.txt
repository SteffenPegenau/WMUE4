i hold joe in extremely high regard up there with the greatest rock guitarists ever.
the cd simply bored me!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i fully understand the reviewers that rated super colossal not very high.
Sorry.
!
i am a huge fan of joe from the beginning.
maybe im very picky but when i played the cd it didnt make me think that i will want to listen to this over and over.
yeah the music is pleasant enough however i did not feel a wow factor that i expect when i buy a joe satriani cd.
i have every cd dvd and bootlegs, have seen him countless times since 87 and he blows me away every time.
we all know that.
i was psyched when i read all the 5 star reviews.
****************************************its nice too see what huge fans joe has.
i dont see that it is necessary to beak down the cd track by track yet again.
im sorry to say this people.
joe is an incredible player.
that is not the issue.

Little Ann is a smart dog.
I like Little Ann because we seem alike.
My favorite part is when little Ann got lost.
The way that they discribe her in the book she sounds pretty.
Billy's other dog is Old Dan.
Little Ann is so small, smart,and vicious.
Old Dan is serious.
I liked this book.
We seem alike because we are both visious.
Old Dan is bigger than Little Ann, but he is not smarter than her.
I am going to be telling you about my favorite part.
Old Dan and Little ann are both red.
I am not small, but we still seem alike.
My favorite character is little Ann.
I wish my dog was like Little Ann.
Little Ann is also more playfull than Old Dan.
I really like Litte Ann.

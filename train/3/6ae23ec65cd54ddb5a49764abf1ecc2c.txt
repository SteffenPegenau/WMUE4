'Robot Man' is one of my favorite rockers.
'Longing For Fire' is nice.
Keep On Rocking!
But next: 'Live's Like A River' is average.
Look, Scorpions are the best rockers, but this album absolutely not my favorite CD, and it never will.
But 'Evening Wind' and 'The Sun In My Hand' really suck.
Not worthless, just nice.
'Living And Dying' is nice.
When you hear it for the first time, it aint bad.
'In Trance' is a very good number.
Listen it more then just once and you start liking it.
But it'll make you bored.
'Dark lady' rocks, but it's better in live.
'Top of the Bill', the beginning is spectacular, but the Chorus is very disapointing.
'Night Lights' is a instrumental song, and I thought that this is typically Ulrich Roth.
I thought, Roth could better stop song writing.
But he's getting better at the Virgin Killer and Taken By Force albums.

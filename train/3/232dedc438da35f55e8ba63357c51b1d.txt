Or buy the "Here on Earth" soundtrack, 'cause that probably has track #3 on it.
This is an okay first album, but she'll probably need to work on quality and her voice for future albums.
P.S.
I thought tracks 1 & 3 were the best.
Sure, some songs should be about love-but not the whole CD!
The rest, however, I could care less for.
I mean, really.
She does have a good voice and sort of sounds like Mariah Carey but she is definintely not up to Mariah's level in the music world yet!
I think it's 'cause all of her songs are about love.
There's something wrong with this CD.
It makes the CD seem kinda mushey or something.
If you only liked the tracks 1 & 3, then you're probably better off buying the singles for them instead.
(I'm not trying to diss Jessica Simpson, by the way).
I don't know.
: Okay, I'll admit it.
So, unless you absolutely LOVE Jessica's music, then I really wouldn't recommend this CD to you.

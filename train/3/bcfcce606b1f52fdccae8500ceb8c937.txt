The music is great but it is not without its flaws.
Stealing Society's lyrics seemed silly as well as She's Like Heroin.
It sucked.
Also, you did get to hear Serj sing for a little bit as well.
Plus there weren't any music vids from Hypnotize!
John did talk but that was only for a short amount of time.
It sounded the same as the audio side did in my stereo...all in all, the dvd gets a 1 out of 5.
I didn't hear anybody else except Daron!
What the hell was that?
4 out of 5 on the audio.Now, on the dvd side.
Just thought you should know.First of all, I will review the Audio side.
You can disagree all you want but that won't influence my opinion.
Then when I saw the Recording of Mezmerize and Hypnotize.
Enhanced audio...I couldn't tell the differance.
I'm not under 13.
Overall Score: 3 out of 5.So there are my thoughts.
Only two music videos?
That's about it.

Better get some good writers for the next one.
:(
I don't want to throw any spoilers out there but the storyline wasn't what i expected and not in a good way, it was truly terrible.
Graphics - awesome.
Sound/Music - off the hook.
This game is for true FF fans just to have and experience otherwise it might be a waste of money.
I didn't play it I lived it.
But I can truthfully say that FF7 was probably my favorite game of all time.
And come on Square, how are you gonna let me finish this game in 18hrs with my characters on levels 48,47 and 46????
Gameplay - very good.
Sorry Square but this one is probably the worst FF i have played.
Now FFX2.
Storyline - terrible.
I'm comparing this game to FF7,8,10 cause those are the games i was mostly into.
SO let me start off by sayin that i'm not a hardcore FF player.
coulda had more playable characters.
The storyline killed this game.

I have them holding the figure up.
But, they did survive.+ side: Solid figure.
Much better than the 2 Spiderman and the 1st movies Green Goblin.
I found 3 in 4 cases.
It's all in how you pose the tentacles.
(Have the tentacles behind Doc and it'll stand).
(...), it's really great.It is short packed; but, not all that uncommon.
I was worried I would break mine.
Becareful bending the tentacles, they are somewhat fragile.
Tentacles feel fragile.
The instructions are not the best, so, that adds to the frustration.
Looks better than the actor.- side: Difficult getting the tentacles on.
I have my Doc Ock standing on it's own.
This is a very stout, and highly articulated rotocast figure.
There's only 3 figures to a case, however.The tentacles are very difficult to get in.
Poor assembly instructions.Score 89% B+
Heavy.

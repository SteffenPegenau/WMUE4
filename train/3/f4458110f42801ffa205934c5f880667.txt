Her sarcasm toward the main male character got old quick.
The problem that I had with this story was first of all, the main Female character.She starts out in the beginning of the story being a strong, sarcastic, television icon.
I don't want a picture of Harrison Ford in my mind as I read about the main character.
's books, later, much later.
The other problem I had, and I have this with several authors, is E.A.
book that I have read.
I know this is fiction, but it has to be somewhat believable.
It was good.
I was surprised in the end.
Then, in a flick of the pen, in one page and a paragraph shift, she becomes, frightened and needy.
This is the 2nd E.A.
There were small details that were out of place and this annoyed me also.
compares her character's physical traits with a well know actress or actor (both books).
I did appreciate the plot.
I will probably try one more of E.A.

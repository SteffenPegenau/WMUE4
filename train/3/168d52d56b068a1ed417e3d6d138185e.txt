Those fantasies seemed to revolve around torture and murder, while in House of Sin sex is on the menu--and there's a huge variety!

It's eerie and weird, without making your stomach churn (which I felt while watching Hostile!)

House of Sin didn't disappoint me.
What fantasies do you keep locked up?

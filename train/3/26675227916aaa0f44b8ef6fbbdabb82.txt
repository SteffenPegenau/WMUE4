He put it to good use in politics I might add.
They are played by Priscilla Davis (the star) Jane Bryant (the pregnant one) & Jane Wyman (Ronnie's girl).
They became a couple.
Unlikely.
In fact by the time the sequel came along, Brother Rat & a Kid, they were either engaged or married.
He co-stars behind his fellow VMI cadets, played by Eddie Albert & Wayne Morris.
As an actor.
He was really pretty good.
High energy comedy.
This is where Reagan met his first wife, Ms Wyman.
What publicity.
They are uniformly cute, perky & smart but incredibly naive.
They're ready to graduate if they can stay out of trouble & away from the girls.
A fun movie.
The further he recedes into history, the more I seem to appreciate Ronald Reagan.
This is 1938 after all.
An early effort when he was a contract player was Brother Rat.
Lots of clean hi-jinks as they use to say.

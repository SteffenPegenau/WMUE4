The lyrics were strong, but the music to back them up was very dissapointing.
"Robot Eyes" (3/5): A decent song, again though nothing memorable.
"Life Goes On" (4/5): They finish on a good note with this song.I am a huge fan of Vagrant Records and have enjoyed many No Motiv tracks in the past.
"Laid To Rest" (3/5): Not horrible, but not great by any means.
"Independence Day" (4/5): A great opener.
"Fall From Grace" (4/5): My favorite track on the album.
Hopefully they'll come back strong with the next release.Rating: Three stars.
"Brand New Day" (4/5): My second favorite.
"Into The Darkness" (3/5): The lead single, it personally doesn't do anything for me.
"Death In Numbers" (2/5): Probably my least favorite track.
(3/5): Great lyrics here, but weak musically.
"Audition" (2/5): Another track that doesn't float my boat.
"Where Did You Go?"
"Grey Notes Fall" (3/5): An average song, nothing more.
Unfortunately, this record did not impress me much.

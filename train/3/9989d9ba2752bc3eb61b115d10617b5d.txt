the fact that "ma i dont love her" was released as a single is horrible, considering they never released "virginia" (the beat that is at the end of the grindin video) that is the best track on the cd.best tracks - grindin, virginia, when the last time, i'm not you w/ jadakiss.download the spectacular tracks, dump the rest
though there are some spectacular beats...the neptunes originality doesn't always fit the flows the clipse has.

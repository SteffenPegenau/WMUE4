I can recommend PC Mover to people who havea.
Bottom line is, I got my files and most settings moved from a Vista computer to a new Windows 7 computer.
But it was not a quick, easy or painless process.Problem 1.
purchased it cheaplyb.
I then needed to install special drivers onto the new computer to make that cable work.
I went back to an old version of the program that I still had around, and found the USB cable.
know something about computer TLCc.
Close program, reselect options, each time.
and possess lots and lots of patience
At least I could start from the most recent crash rather than all over from scratch.So my new computer is running OK after a few manual tweaks.
That's a LOOONG time, pardner.Problem 2.
The included, special ethernet cable would not handshake correctly between the two machines.
Three breakdowns/crashes en route.
BORING.

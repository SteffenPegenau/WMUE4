First the game is short.
I realised that majority doesn't always rule.
Over half of it is cutscenes.
You spend lots of money for games these days.
Overall I felt like I was jipped by this game.
I also got a feeling that through the dialog the creators were trying to preach to me some political agenda.
The controls were very awkward.
I bought this game because I had read many favorable reviews, but I made one mistake.
Which makes the game difficult.
So I bought this game expecting something similar.
Boy was I disappointed.
If I wanted a movie I would have bought myself a good dvd to watch.
Which I hate!
I will admit that I have never played any other Metal Gear game before, but I love sneaking, spying type games (loved Splinter Cell).
I ignored those reviewers who had some critisms.
Unless you are a huge fan of the orignal, I'd say skip it!
I also found the story a bit ridiculous and some of the characters were quite annoying.
Lots of long and drawn out dialog.

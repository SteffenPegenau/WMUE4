Love(pretty ballad from all 3 girls)Worst song on here is:"IS SHE THE REASON"!!
Bad Habit(Kelly's solo track.
It was such a weak song to put out as a single when they could have released something better.
There are a few things that are wrong with it and the main one being that it is too slow!
They should have released "Through With Love" which is the BEST song from the album and the BEST Destiny's Child song ever!Single's should have been:1.
Through With LoveOther than the singles, the best songs are:1.
Through With Love(the BEST song of their career!)2.
There is only 1 song you can really dance to, that being "Lose My Breath".They SHOULD NOT have released "Girl" as a single!!!
Its awesome)3.

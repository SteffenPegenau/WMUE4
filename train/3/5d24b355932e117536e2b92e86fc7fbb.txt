It doesn't fit in the slots of my CD rack, there is no spine to read even if I do put it in there.

This really sucks.
DISCONTINUE THE STUPID DIGIPAK, PLEASE.
Why can't artists just stick to the good old fashioned CD jewel case?

The Digipak is the worst idea ever.

Prince and the RHCP have jumped on the Digipak bandwagon, and it sucks.
I'm sure this fancy packaging cost more than a jewel case.
Not water resistant, not abrasion resistant.
I can't see that happening with Digipaks.

I heard the War Report and I've heard N.O.R.E.
Other than that he only gets 3 stars.
and now this original sound is getting old.
I liked the way he let go on that one.
That is what made Nore shine.
However, he had other cool tracks.
fu*ked up big time sampling "Caravan of Love" for the song.
Just as Snoop needs Dre, Victor Santiago needs Kiam Holley to really shine.
If it wasn't for Nas on the track, "Body In The Trunk" I would have put this CD at the bottom of my collection.
Esta Loca was a head banger.
Original sound.
L.E.S.
"The Way We Live" with Chico Debarge had potential, but Chico killed it with his singing.
19 tracks of Nore over and over can't cut it.
His style grows tired after the first 4 cuts.

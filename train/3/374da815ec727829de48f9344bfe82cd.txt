while the other one requires recharging.
There is a new Bose 3 out.
In summary, just as advertised.
And I had the opportunity to test both on a 747.
The E2c is good noise isolation but Bose 2 is superior for noise cancellation.
So the question of how long you may be using the expensive Bose 3 would be of concern.
These are good earphones.
For light use, the E2c is good.
But, I tend to think the Bose 2 is still better in as much as you can replace the battery any time.
Especially on a long 747 flight.
Rechargeable batteries do not last forever.
The Bose wins hands down when it comes to noise cancellation.
I have both the Bose 2 Quiet Comfort and these E2c earphones.
But for portability and light use, the Shure E2c is not a bad option.
If you would want heavy noise cancellation, get the bose.

But, it does have those stellar tracks on there.
Plus, we've heard all of these!
Frolic's choice of mixes are right on.
This is not that CD.
Pick it up if you're more into the trancier elements of happy hardcore.
I had high hopes for this CD.
Just hoping that it could live up to the greatness of Chapters 2&3, but it falls short.
Here are the best tracks on the CD: Take It From The Groove, Music I Like, Excitement, Blue Moon, Stay With Me, Space Invader.
Fabulous Faber did a great job with it.
"Blue Moon" and "Excitement" that follow are also great tracks, but from there, we run into some not to great tracks.
I think people were looking for something new and shocking.
The opening track "Music I Like" is genius however.
Scott Brown's mix of "Space Invader" also a great choice.
Stir up the scene a little bit.
The energy and feeling just isn't there!
DNA & Breeze's mix of "Take It From The Groove" is IMO the best.

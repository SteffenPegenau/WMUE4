Girl loves boy.
But it was good to see both Shah Rukh Khan and Rani again.
On my list of Great, Good, and Terrible Bollywood movies this is on the low end of Good.
They're wonderful!
The movie was fine the first time through... though with all that fighting 3 hours seemed like 3 years.... but I'll probably never watch this one again.
So what do they fill it up with?
Boy chases girl across the world to try to woo her.
Bickering.
Mindless arguing that continues through nearly every minute of the movie.
Boy falls in love.
And if you've ever seen a Bollywood movie before, you know there's at least 2 and 1/2 hours left.
Boy meets girl.
That's the first 30 minutes of this movie.
They live happily ever after.
Girl is already engaged to another.

I was slightly annoyed at how they pumped this movie up so much, and it wasn't that funny.
The menus get very repetitive and the music is VERY ANNOYING.
The Extra features are good.
The "UNRATED" EDITION features nothing more than a few more women walking around topless and a scene that is rauchier.
Anyways, the DVD is better.
Also, the blooper reel is very funny.
IN conclusion, if you loved this movie, you'll love this dvd.
Old School has its good points and its bad points.
Nothing spectacular.
If you thought the movie was okay...save your money.
The extended scenes are hilarious, and I wonder why the didn't put these in the movie...it would have made the movie funnier.
Nothing spectacular.
There are a couple of standard 8 minute documentaries and the normal trailers and cast etc.
It is not nearly as funny as Road Trip or other college comedies.
The movie is good, although they revealed way too much in the trailers.

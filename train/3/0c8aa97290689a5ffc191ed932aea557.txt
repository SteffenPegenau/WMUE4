"Fight for all the right reasons" is well worth listening too.
There is no deviation from previous NB releases.
I am a NB fan.
This latest release has a few really good tunes on it.
"Savin me" is a really good tune as well.
A bit too much like previous NB releases musically but I liked it quite a bit anyway.The rest did not impress me but was not unpleasent on the ears.
No experimentation.
"If everyone cared" has the catchiest hooks and is a hit waiting to happen.
If you are an NB die hard fan you want this CD.
Nothing with the power of "How you remind me".
"Rockstar" is cute and alot of folks will relate.
Have been from the first time I heard one of thier songs.
I find that I listen to about 3 of the tracks the rest sounding a bit too much like the last NB CD.
"Follow your home" has a good groove to it.
If you are a casual fan this is not the CD for you.

I'm still not sure about the "Dark Nest Trilogy."
This is a character I no longer recognize.
Isn't that a security risk?
Can someone who's read this explain to me how their plan is supposed to provoke the Chiss to attack the Killiks?
It's just not good.
I don't understand that.
It's not even a fair fight.It's the middle book.
The logic just doesn't follow.Jaina and Zekk are Joiners.
Leia and Saba are captured by the Galactic Alliance.Jacen discovers something from Tenel Ka that changes his course.
I can't stand bugs.
No one is worried?And what in the worlds is happening between Luke and Lomi Plo?
How does the hive not know what they are thinking?
Jaina and Zekk follow him against their better judgement.
Not enough happens to give the story direction.
"The Unseen Queen" isn't bad.
It should point us somewhere, but I'm not sure where.
How is it that Lomi Plo is so much more powerful than Luke?
Please let it end soon.
Luke and Han are captured by the Killiks.
There is no ending.

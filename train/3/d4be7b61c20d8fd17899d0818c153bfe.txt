Favorite Song: "Katie, My Love"
I didn't get bored listening to this CD, however I found myself wondering what was going on.
Have I convinced you one way or the other about purchasing this?
The synopsis doesn't seem to help either.
The music doesn't sound old, its jazzy and clubby, not following traditional Broadway, but going more into a vaudevillian-night-club sound.
I would suggest this for Ben Vereen fans, burlesque lovers, and of course the Broadway collectors.
Newer listeners, probably wont want this one.
And of course Ben Vereen is wonderful.
No, and the CD will leave you the same way.
Its a middle of the road CD and its hard to guess who will like it.
Some of the songs on this CD are great.
People with an older taste (showboat), might not go for this either.
Feeling only partially satisfied.
However how many of us listen to a CD for that?
The meaning or underlying effect that this show is supposed to have is... not noticeable from this CD.

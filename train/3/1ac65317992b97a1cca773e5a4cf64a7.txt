Luckily, Tamron covers this with a 6 year warranty.
They were pleasant and told me exactly what to do.
Now, it is going in for repair.
This time; no change.
This had happened twice before.
Fantastically sharp.
Paperweight.
I was at a shoot over the weekend where I had a pro basketball player posing with a model and I get the warning on the back of my 40D that the lens is failing to communicate with the camera.
The lady at Tamron said it sounds like something came loose inside the lens.
Will post the results when I get it back.
I absolutely loved this lens until it broke.
Earlier, I'd wiped down the contacts and reattached the lens and kept shooting.
I'm without my main walk around lens for up to 3 weeks.
Great for the price (I hope)I've had it since June and shot around 2000 pics.
I spoke with them.

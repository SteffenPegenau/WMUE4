They cut a plastic 2 inch by 2 inch wrapper off the front.
I guess you get what you pay for.
Horrible Company!
It's a fun game overall.
It more directed for age group of 10, and 12.
I like my games in the original sealed package.
I just don't like this seller.
I looked at the wrapper and there was a small orange price tag.
I never heard of Zoop when I was younger playing on the Sega Genesis.
It was probably a cheaper price than what they sold it for.
Leaving the razor blade marks on the box.
Thanks for ruining the box, and wrapper!
I bought 7 games from them, because of there low prices.
Will Not Use Again!
So I bought this game Zoop.

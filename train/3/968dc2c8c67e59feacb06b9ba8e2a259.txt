Its almost like making it so that Secertariat and all those other grweat horses disapear.
And how can u like Precieous.
Just because Star wins all the time and sets track records doesnt mean its his falt.
But still, it kinda needs to be fixed.
So how can u love a horse that u hardly know about?
I love them both.
We all know Star and Champion are both great horses and one of the best.
I mean I would have liked her to if she where actaully exsisted.
I do like Champion more but that doesnt mean get rid of Star jsut because hes fast.
The colt loves to run and he has Wonders speed, heart, and a fire that can not be put out.
Champion and Star and 2 of the most greatest horses ever and that Star is spoiled.
He was Wonders last foal and Wonder didnt die so u can say u want her colt to disapear.
Just get to like the colt.
Even though the review Im responding to was like 4-5 yeares ago.
The only time I heard them mention Precieous was when she was born.

Especially the 7:24 minute title track - nearly epic.
Is he still alive?Out to the record shop.
But unfortunately No More Tears fades in quality on the B Side, and you start getting enough of Ozzy's voice.
MTV.
Not bad.
Other highlights are the opener Mr Tinkertrain and the closer Road To Nowhere.
Waiting for the end caption.
A quick snack.
Great rock.
1991.
Back from high school.
Buy album.
Artist Ozzy Osbourne, song No More Tears, album No More Tears.
Heavyer than most stuff then.
Isn't that that crazy guy?
But contrasted with Ozzy's kinda whining voice.The A Side is nearly perfect.
Switch on telly.
Great rock song - who is that?
Ozzy Osbourne!

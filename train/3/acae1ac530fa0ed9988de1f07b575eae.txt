This is def.
Very good!
I wasn't a huge fan of that one.
That song had a nice hook, and great beats to it.
Overall, i'd most of the tracks were strong,but there were different.
If anybody loves 80's music or the eurythmics then def.
an expermental album for them(you can kind of tell by the 1st track, Bethoveen).
This cd seems to fall alittle flat.
into their music.
I heard some negative reviews about this cd, so I was initally turned off by it, but decided to give it a chance.
Although, i did love the Japanese lover track.
It's def.
Classic Eurythmics style!
check this album out!
a different direction for them.
There were a few other tracks that seemed to incorparate the whole rockabilly sound(which is something i love!)
I thought it was good, but compared to Annie Lennox/Eurythmics other work.

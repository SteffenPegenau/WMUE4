It just doesn't match up to the rest of the tunes.
It's not a real dark and depressing collection of songs.
They are good musicians and songwriters--they surely left a mark on me.
Loverboy has always been a band that I've had respect for.
Loverboy has always been a pretty cool group with a straight-ahead sound.
My favorite songs are "Turn Me Loose," "Prissy Prissy," and "It Don't Matter."
The guitar and keyboard playing is cool too.
The only song I've never liked to listen to is "Little Girl."
I still listen to this album from time to time.
This is an enjoyable album to listen to.
I find this debut album from Loverboy to be respectable.
I've always liked the way they have blended guitars and keyboards in their music.
This first album is tight, energetic, and upbeat.
Mike Reno sings well on here--he's always had an instantly recognizable voice.
It does sound a bit dated, but that doesn't take anything away from it.

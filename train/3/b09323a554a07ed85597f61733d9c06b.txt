Jean could have just be that they all introduce themselve without thos names.
and all those pages of describing the area.
It seems another book may be on the way but I just hope is better.I gave it a 3 beause Im a big fan.
the ending left me hangging and wanting more.
It left me wondering about Lanoga and lanidar.
I mean, there ae too many loose ends.
I to scipped pages.
What about Marona, Laranar and Brukeval?
It took me 3 days to read it, as much as I liked the first 4 books I to was disapointed.
All those name repetition.
She could have don better.
I would have like more action between characters.
Jean if you are reading this "PLEASE STOP THE REPETITION AND ALL THOSE DESCRIPTIONS PLEASE"
And what is the deal with the Zelandonia?
Do they end up trading with the Clan?

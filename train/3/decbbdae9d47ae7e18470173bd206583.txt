only the last line of the song is at least a tiny bit powerful : i've lost my love of life.
it had almost a pink floyd feel to it, except not as good.
this one is more rock'n'roll.
their sophmore release leaves more to be desired.
deep, man.
the first album was a masterpiece.
i think with time i'll grow to like all of them.
the sensative touch is laking here too.
there were a few good songs on it, though.
i definately got the "we wanna go mainstream" vibe from the album and the pictures of crosby in the album look like he's trying WAY too hard to fit into the rock world.
blue and free are favourites.
a tv and you?
the second - the beginings of a mediocre rock opera.
i loved the emotion rawness of the first album.
VAST's first album visual audio sensory theater was absolutely amazing.
jon's amazing voice was drowned out by mediocre guitar riffs, and the wonderful monk chants that lit up the first album just fade into the background.

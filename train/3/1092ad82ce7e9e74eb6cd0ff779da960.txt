However, if you want it for the video maker and editor, it is pretty basic.
Game play is similar to the sims or Cruise Tycoon.
So if you have problems you are probably out of luck.
You just choose the action and they perform it.
You create or choose an actor, make a script, and shoot the movie.
But, in my opinion the animations are really lame and not realistic at all though.
Now, about the game.
You choose a pre-made backdrop, choose the year, and write the script.
First off, let me say this.
It says you can create your own movies.
Well, not exactly.
All the actions though, are already made.
Instead you are going to have to install it manually.
But overall it is a pretty good game, if you like tycoon games.
If you have a new computer, the auto-run feature won't work.
This game is not new at all.
Also, customer support on this product no longer exists.

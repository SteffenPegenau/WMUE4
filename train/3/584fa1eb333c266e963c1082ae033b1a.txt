Several of us walk our dogs together in the morning and each time we met, we would mention how depressing this book is.
Would I read it again?
Maybe.
During our group meeting, we had so many questions that were left unanswered.
My reading group recently chose this book as our September selection.
Am I glad I read it?
If you need to feel that your family, no matter how dysfunctional, is normal - this is the book for you.
That is something only you can determine.
No.
Would I recommend this book?
Should you read it?
Why that?
Yes.
What were they thinking?
Why this?
You actually couldn't put it down - but, you were haunted by the family depicted in this epic.

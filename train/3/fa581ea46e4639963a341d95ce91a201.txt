Their collections are usually at best mediocre.
All of the recordings sound like demos.
This is the second attempt at re-recording past hits.
Her new look is great, and It would be nice to see her get the recognition she so much deserves in the music industry.
The songs are great songs.
I just hope that she will return soon with new material.
I know she still has some incredible recordings to deliver.
I have been a fan of Juice Newton since the early days, and I have to say that this is the first cd that I have been disappointed with.
I honestly do not see the point at doing them again..... New material is always more welcomed in my opinion.
I recently bought the collection by Juice.
The production is the problem.
She is in great voice as always.
Juice is still my favorite female artist.
Juice is not the problem here.
Also, I noticed this collection is by Madacy.

It didn't work.
THE END?
Got a reply and he had me try a few things.
No problems until this week.
I just paid over $30.
for this ink cartridge and can't use it at all!
Wrote to online customer service.
He wrote back that the printer was not reading the new cartridge and I needed to repair or replace it!
Loved it!
I've bought exclusively hp for the past 6 years and this problem really bothers me.
Great printer including photos from 4x6 up to 8-1/2x11.
I worked at it for a long time.
Nothing doing!
Changed black ink cart with a new hp #96 cartridge.
We'll see... On the plus side.......the online repair tech was very helpful and spelled things out very well in an easy to understand way.
He had me print a test page and report a series of number results to him.
It might be the end of me being an hp fan.
Bought my 6540 1-1/2 years ago.
I live in rural MN and its over an hours drive to a major city.
No other options...........repair or replace?

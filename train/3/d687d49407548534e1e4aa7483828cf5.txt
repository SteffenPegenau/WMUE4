Only the Retriever and one of the labs will eat from it.
I was determined and thought that if they got hungry enough they would.
I had to put a screw driver in the door to prop it open in order for them to eat from it though.
It is a good quality and I think in theory, it's a good design.
The other half, I still gotta fill up a bowl every day.
I've had it for 3 weeks hoping things would improve.
The other two dogs won't go near it.
I have 4 dogs.
So for me, it's a very expensive dog bowl.
It's just my dogs just don't want to stick there head in there.
Um...no.
So, I still keep putting food in it because half my dogs use it (with the door propped open).
A Golden Retriever, 2 lab mixes and a terrier mix.
I kept an eye on all of them and the one lab didn't eat for 2 days before I finally caved in a put food in a bowl.
Otherwise the door scarred them and they wouldn't eat.
Sadly, no.
The terrier would only grab a bit at a time, walk away and chew and then return.

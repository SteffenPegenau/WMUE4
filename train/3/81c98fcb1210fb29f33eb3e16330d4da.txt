Do not expect a fast moving film but enough to keep your intrest.
Her relationships are both hetrosexual and lesbian.
She keeps this doll all the way to adult hood.
She gives her a doll to help substitute for friends.
Do not expect a lot of violence but enough to perk the film up.
A very intresting film to say the least.
It done very well and has a good story line.
She tries to find the one person to love her and only her and not just a one night stand.
Starting from her child hood and her mom.
It is worth checking out.
This moves May to make her own personal love from the parts of others.
It more about the plot and not the violence.
May is a disturbing young woman who does not have the best of social skills.
She talks to it as if it is a living breathing person.
IT had a good script great acting and a nice creepy feel to it.

I wnet to my friends house and played his blood omen 2. same thing.
Then I walked next door and bought it at Wal*Mart.
Rent this game.
also wasn't the playstation2 either)
You get frustrated by the bad combat control.By the way, every boss is a puzzle fight.
There is no replay value.
Do that 3 times and the boss is dead.
After that the rest of the game is glitchy and bad voice over.
This game was a great game.
It's always hit hit, flip switch, throw into steam.
I had just met the seer and had to return it.
I rented it and played it for the 2 days I rented it as a new release.
BIG Mistake.
It seems the copy at blockbuster was the golden copy.
(Note:My copy was not a glitchy copy.

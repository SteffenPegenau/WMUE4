Otherwise it's a pretty cool little unit.
Also, if I'm listening to the messages and pick up the receiver to call someone, the playback ceases.
Never had problems early on like this!
Sad to have to take it back.
Noise!
There's interference.
Never paid $... for a phone before.
It's bad enough for others to have commented on it and we've only had it about 2 weeks.
We are taking it back, and based on our experience and other unfavorable reviews it will be a return, not an exchange for another one.
The phone is kinda cool!
Paid over $... at Costco for this phone.
It can't do two things at once.
Finally, the menus for turning off the ringer (so I can sleep) are somewhat convoluted.
It's as if it's a pre-900 mHz phone.
Problem?

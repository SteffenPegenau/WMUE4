I was definitely getting sick of Sterling, but I thought Christina loved her to much to give her up.
what happened to the baby Ashleigh was supposed to have in #23?
Also, i miss sooo many of the characters in the old books.
or christina and Melanie.
Keep the racers coming!
all it said was that she moved to Belmont.
And for your information, new authors, townsend acres' colors are green and gold, not red and black!
but this book Was well written.
I like it a lotmore now that Christina's into racing, but it was kind of weird forher to all the sudden decide to become a jockey, when she had trainedher whole life to be in the Olympics.
she loved Whitebrook so much.
And what about all the horses?
And why did Sammy move to Ireland?
And now that Ashleigh rode in a race again, I was just wondering if Ashleigh and Christina would race against each other.
And what happened to Cindy?
Well, this series is definitely getting better.
Champion, Pride, Shining, Glory, ect.

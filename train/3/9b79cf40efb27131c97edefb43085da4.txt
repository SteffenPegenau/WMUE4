unit to unit variation?
But it also has some issues - or potential issues that everyone should at least consider.1.
Note that others have reported this fault too.
Who knows.I've had one that i bought ages ago (from Verizon) for much more money.
This speaks either badly for QC or for the nature of these surplus units being sold.2.
Overall ,this has a lot going for it.
I wonder if the standards have slipped, or if i'm unlucky ( and so are others)?Just_me
The clarity is excellent, but sometimes you must shout to be heard.
Again, scanning the reviews it appears some find this fault and others don't.
Cheap, comfortable, and superb sound quality both on the incoming and the outgoing sides.
Fit?
of the two i bought (surplus, OEM planet), one was defective upon receipt.
Mine has very low output (mic) volume.
The wire was broken at the connector.
Its been a workhorse.

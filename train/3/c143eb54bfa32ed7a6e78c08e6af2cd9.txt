One song would be great if it weren't for the incessant cymbal hiss masking the great work beneath it.I wanted to love this album.
Overall it's a lot of fun.
Although you can here the genius behind the musicians, at this point they hadn't figured out how to turn that into 4 minute songs.
Too much on purpose noise infiltrates the mix.
Another distraction is their deliberate attempt to be "lo-fi".
The bad?
The song writing.
There some excellent jams, rhythms, and riffs throughout the album.
First the good.
But ultimately, get Hello Avalanche and enjoy their unique mix of music and pass on this one.
Nope, just a "cool" sound effect.
It ranges from laid back to frenetic paces.
At one point I thought my speaker was blown.
After loving their new album, Hello Avalanche, I was very eager to get their first album to see how they began.
Instead it was an interesting and promising beginning for Octopus Project.
Many compositions here meander aimlessly or stay stuck on one riff too long.

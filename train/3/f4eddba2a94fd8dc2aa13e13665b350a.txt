But not in this case.
Very good.
It is too long.
So I knew that I'd be getting into a very long reading project.
My version is about 1150 pages.
But there is so much stuff written into this book that can be cut.
I read for fun, not torture.
But the book is so long that it is a tedious read.
The story is good.
And too boring.
Too time consuming.
Most of the time when you see a King film then read the book, it's like they are two entirely different stories.
I had to put this book down many times before finally finishing it.
(I probably should have read the abridged version, but then I'd always wonder what I missed)Another thing that biased my opinion is that I've seen the movie already.
Just by looking at this book you can see that it is incredibly long.
The movie is really a great adaptation to the book, so I didn't feel like I added anything to The Stand by reading it.The bottom line is that this book is just TOO MUCH.

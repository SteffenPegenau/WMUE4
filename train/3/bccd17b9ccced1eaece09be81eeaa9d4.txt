Just when things seem to be getting exciting it's over.Overall it's a good and fun game.
And the other cliche, the fly inside a ship.
They don't even make any sense.
The space missions were the best and gave the best feel of flying a starfighter.But the biggest problem is the game is totally short.
But not there yet.
Within 5 seconds this game pulled me in.
But it's length is a real drawback.
Some of the missions have so many enemy ships flying around it really is incredible to see.The problems with the game are a couple of stupid missions.
Every Starwars game has a canyon run.
The ships are amazing the combat spectacular and the story exciting.
2 hours of play and I had finished.
For once even some of the characters are really cool, the alien ones of course.
The cliche canyon run is so over done as to be utterly dull.
Overall this game is really amazing.
They are on the right track.
2 hours and it's all over.

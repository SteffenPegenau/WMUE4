You cant go very far.
You can eat yeah...but thats is.
As the story progresses you expect a terrifying climax in true King style.

A good story line.
Some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired.
Give it a try and see what you think.
Remember that this is only my opinion.
But this is nice for a change.
And although some of the actors/actresses really try, you really have to try hard, use your imagination to really see in your own mind what is happening.
I, however, felt let down.
The people are stuck in a super market, so when you think about it, there is only so much you can do.
The Mist in 3D sound obviously has a lot of great sound effects.
Personally, I prefered the book.
The louder it is the more you are likly to jump.
It all depends how loud you crank up the volume as to how scared you get.
But I leave it up to you.

Cut-scenes can be great in a videogame if done well, but that isn't the case here.
This really isn't an RPG, it's just a CGI movie with some RPG elements thrown in on the side.
But that's about it.
Yes, spectacular.
Beautiful.
Linear gameplay with no room to explore, moving basically from one overlong boring cutscene to the next.
Oh well, time to move on to other games, for me Final Fantasy is done.
Blitzball was terrible too.
Obviously many others diasgree as we can see from the many rave reviews.
This game reminds of something teenage girls would love.
Even Metal Gear Solid 2, with it's outrageous cut-scenes was better.
Let's face it, Final Fantasy is not what it used to be.
Annoying, goofy, naive characters with nails-across-the-blackboard voice acting.
Let teenage girls enjoy future installments and I'll mind my business.3 stars for breakthrough graphics.
Graphics?

It just wasn't good enough.
The suspense and the unsettling weirdness are there.
The "happening" itself isn't really explained.
Not for M. Night.
I've watched and loved all his films (even the not so warmly received ones), but this was just not good enough for a director his caliber.
But for M. Night, this is rather weak.
With any other director behind the wheel, this would have been a decent attempt.
There's no trademark Shayamalan twist, no mind-boggling revelations, no explosive finale that sends you on an emotional roller coaster.
Yes, it's nicely filmed, no complaints there.
No, in fact we're told outright that it was "something that occurred naturally and may never be fully explained".
There are plenty of plot holes.
What isn't there is the payoff.
The acting is decent.
I get the impression that M. Night wasn't really sure what movie to make, and once he had begun making it, he wasn't sure where he was going with it.
It wasn't terrible.

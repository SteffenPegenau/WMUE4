The musicianship, songwriting, and production are good.
It sounds quite different from the other songs.
Ozzy does a nice job with the vocals.
No More Tears is a satisfying and energetic album.
The keyboard playing is very lush and ethereal.
He really did a good job with it.
My favorite tunes are "No More Tears," "Mama, I'm Coming Home," and "Time after Time."
This is a good album.
Zakk Wylde's guitar work is also skilled.
It's worth a listen.
The other tracks are listenable, too.
This disc is in a straight-ahead hard rock direction.
All of the tracks are pretty cool.
It's one of Ozzy's best songs.
He can really shred.
I've always admired "No More Tears."
"Mama, I'm Coming Home" and "Time after Time" are good power ballads.

included on the same c.d.
was supposed to include the first two releases by felt, but I got the single (Crumbling...) by itself.
So be wary of any seller with too high a rating.
The c.d.

itself is good not great but I knew that since I had the c.d.
The version you are buying might not be what you get.
The market place seller blamed Amazon and bugged me to remove my poor rating.
The c.d.
So Amazon shoppers be careful.
The main problem I have with the c.d.
but I have given up on that now.
before.
Of cource I previously owned the version with the stronger Splendour of Fear e.p.

A reflective song.
This album is pretty good on the whole.
Just a few flaws.
It's so morbid.
The songs I do like include: 'Northern Star':This is something special.
One of them is the overall mood throughout.
But this one grows on you.
Melanie C demonstrates her talent as a singer here.
The other is that some of the songs are just too long and need to be shortened.
Breezy and meaningful.
It has a nice R&B feel to it, combined with a strong rythmic flavour.
I'll be interested to see what Melanie C offers in her next album.
'Never be the Same Again': I didn't like this one at first because of the transition from Melanie C to Lisa Lopez seemed a big clash.
'If That Were Me': This song has a powerful meaning of poverty amongst a background of wonderful orchestral settings.
I recommend this as a release.
I brought this album because she is the only one of the Spice Girls who can sing.

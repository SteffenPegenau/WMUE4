I have to say....
I want more NICK MORELLI.
And the plot just seemed to drag on when I knew who the killer was half way through.
I am really disappointed in this third outting.
Get rid of him.
Normally her books take a maximum of 3 days with me.Maggie was a lush in this book with such a wall around her, you almost didn't care for her.
Imagine my disappoinment trying to get through this book.
Its a no-child divorce that should've been done with at the end of the last book.
And Greg!!!!!
Heck, she has enough of her own money, so whats the hold up?
Every August I wait until Ms. Kava's books are out and this one was like no other wait.
This is too long of a tease.
Unfortunately, it was not worth the wait.
Still, I eagerly await any other book Ms. Kava writes.
She is on my list of faves and I am not giving up on her yet!
Took me a week and a 1/2.
I fell inlove with Ms. Kava's two previous novels (A Perfect Evil and Split Second- both 5 star and above novels).

One of the things that is great about the movie is the special effects.
One of the bad things is that the movie skipped around a lot.
Like they didn't show how or when Eragon learn the magic.
Another thing is that the movie was too short so it cut out a lot of the book.
If it were more like the book it would have been better.
Or if it didn't skip around as much.
If you want to see a good movie with a lot of action watch Eragon.
It is also fast paced with a lot of fights and action.There were also a lot of bad things in the movie.
And they made the shade ride a dragon.The movie Eragon could have been better if it was longer.
They also changed a lot of things from the book.
The movie also had a great story line.
The mane reason I like the movie is because it was different from any other movie I've seen.
The movie Eragon was a good movie.
Like they made Brom, Eragon's friend burn down his house not the Ra'zac.
There were a lot of good things about the movie.

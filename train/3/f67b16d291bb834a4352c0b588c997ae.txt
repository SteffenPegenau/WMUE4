The experience of reading Ms. Reed didn't feel new or different.
And before.
And before.
I'll give it that.
The love scene is good.
It was readable, however.
It has enough to keep me turning pages.
This one is thisclose.
Will I try the other two in Ms. Reed's trilogy?
Maybe.
That kept it floating.
The sprinking of foreign language is annoying.
I love a good historical romance.
(that's not a pun) The ship scenes are really good - really.
And before.
The opening isn't bad - just lengthy.
It wasn't fresh.
The whole reason I didn't find it very enjoyable?
Into His Arms felt like something I've read before.

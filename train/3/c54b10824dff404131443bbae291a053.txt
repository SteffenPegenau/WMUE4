There were some parts of the book that were excellent at showing human nature and how people relate to each other.
I don't know whether the reader is supposed to sympathize with Paul Morel, but I didn't.
In fact, I did not find any characters that I liked.
The ending left me unsatisfied.
I also did not quite feel the relationship between Paul and his mother.
- I don't know, just arrogant.
Although you don't have to like the characters to like the book, I didn't even like the plot.
For instance, Paul was attracted to Clara because at first she was indifferent to him.
In conclusion, I like the book, I just don't loooove the book.
It just shows you that The Rules were at work even nearly a century ago!
- he is arrogant and - what were his qualities?
You're probably wondering why I gave it three stars.
I found him to be - what did I find him to be?
Sons and Lovers, while a good book, is not, in my opinion, great.
It was bland.

I have been a Josh Groban fanatic ever since his first CD, and I have been hungry for his latest one to come out.
Here's hoping for more great Josh CDs.
I am a voice person, I both perform singing and have been teaching for years.

Several of the songs seem to be pushing the limits of his comfortable range, and I could be wrong but it seems like he is trying to make a more "pop" sound.
Josh take care of your beautiful voice!!
Don't listen to anybody but yourself!
.
.
I admit there are many things on the CD I like: Josh's general style and choice of music, but I am concerned after listening to this CD several times that Josh seems to be "straining" his voice for the first time.
Sigh.
I hope not.
.
This would be a grave mistake and lead his beautiful voice down the road of many others who were seduced by the dark side.

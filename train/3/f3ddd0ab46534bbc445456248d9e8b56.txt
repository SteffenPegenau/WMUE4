Anyway, I was expecting the "snap" as advertised and shown on T.V.
So I didnt actually "pay" for these.
I understood all the cookies to be in a cool paint can, apparently when you buy the sampler package they just come in a foil bag inside a cardboard box.
IMO
A very mild flavor not as I expected.
If you only eat a few cookies the rest get stale VERY quickly.
Guess you shouldn't believe what you see on T.V.
UNDERWHELMED and DISSAPPOINTED.
And about the packaging.
A typical shortbread, not a lot of crunchy candy and over half of the cookies were broken in the package!!
Well, One bite of each cookie was enough for me, Now I have 30.00 worth of cookies sitting in my cupboard.
The only "snap" was actually a "crunch" of a LITTLE candy in the cookie.
I saw these on food networks "Unwrapped" and couldn't wait to try them, I actually and thankfully signed up for an Amazon CC and got a 30.00 credit.
I was very disappointed.
The flavors were okay.

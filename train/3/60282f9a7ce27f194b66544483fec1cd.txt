Get real.
The book is thick and just screams..."Hold on tight!"
!
They look perferated, but they only minimally rip along the dotted lines.
Argh.
On a budget?
And pearls?
Purchase with high hopes, but keep realistic in mindset.
The task involved buying arm-length lace gloves..."at the mall".
It was annoying.
And then you have to rip the top and bottom off too.
I chose the first "idea" and boy, was I completely annoyed with how hard it is for small, dainty, lady hands to rip those pages out.
I've looked this book up several times and finally got the nerve to buy it.
Let's just say I spent $... on a nice lingerie set and improvised.
I don't know where Laura Corn buys her clothes, but no mall near me stocks "arm-length lace gloves".
I nearly ripped the whole page out by accident!
(Not that we needed the book, it just seemed really fun, you know?)
I can't wait to try more!

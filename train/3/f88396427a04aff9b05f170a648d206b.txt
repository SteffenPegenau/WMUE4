Myths.
The main characters--Jude Frances Murray and Aidan Gallagher--are two of the most stubborn people I've ever read about.
Bah.
Well, apparently I do.
Do people still believe in that?
I can't really ask for more from a book.
Beyond revitalizing a part of me that I thought was lost, it made me care about the people involved.
At times I wanted to jump into the fray and give them both a good smack.
My mom recommended this book to me by saying that it was about fairies and wishes and things she didn't believe in and couldn't relate to.
Which is another reason I enjoyed this book immensely.
My intial reaction was that it was far too fanciful for me, I read the synopsis on the back of the book and was less than intrigued.
Who cares since they aren't real?
The part of you that believes in friendly ghosts, energetic fairies and magic.
Fairies.
This book has the ability to appeal to the dreamer in anyone.
Magic.

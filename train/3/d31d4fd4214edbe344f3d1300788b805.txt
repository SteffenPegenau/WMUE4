It had its moment but I thought the Natalie Portman character was kind of stupid, and I like Natalie.
.
.
But if i hated the movie lol .
.
for that reason I just think that it felt like Zorro meets Revolutionist meets Batman Gotham City.
!
forget HD lol rather buy Muppet Show HD DVD than this, but it wasn't BAD!!
I will say at the end with all the masks.
I'm buying it lol with just 3 stars but thats because i'm builting an HD DVD Collections and think this movie would look great!!!
.
or twice.
Although, i will buy it in HD DVD format but I think it's a movie that will grow on you if watched more than once.
.
First of all, I thought it was kind of cheesy and how it was just not much as what I expected.
"cool part!"
.
.
but oh well...... Should Rent it and atleast give this movie a try.

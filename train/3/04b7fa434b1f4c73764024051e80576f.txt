"Y'all" in every sentence?
I'm from Texas and NO ONE speaks like that.
Y'all is short for "you all".
Um....I'm not sure that the main character ever had a mouse in her pocket...she is only ONE person.
The character Ginger.
The reason for the three stars?
Quite annoying.
That dialect for this character was so far over the top that I began to loathe her halfway through the story.
Perhaps this author doesn't know that.
I'd like to see what pot Kendall stirs up next.
the character says "are y'all coming to dinner?"
Really?
But instead of saying "you"...i.e "are you coming to dinner?"
And it may stop me from even considering the other stories.....
I really enjoyed this mystery book and am delighted to find that it's a series and I can keep reading.

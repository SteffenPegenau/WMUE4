It kinda ruins the book.
It's dumb and has no point.
I absolutely loved it, it is one of the greatest books.
All in all the book is pretty stupid and it's a relief the author's dead a Cotton's an eejit for commiting suicide.
I also don't want to see Teft portrayed by someone.
First off I just want to comment on the summary of the book that was in there with all the other reader comments.
It is not up there with Outsiders.
I read Outsiders for a sixth grade novel study.
I just don't think you ought to be comparing Bless the Beasts and Children with it.
It's just not my type.
But it can pass time, and it's not absolute trash.
It's pretty bad.
Although I quite liked Teft.
I think the movie's baaad.
Or it was an accident.
Who cares.
For instance, Cotton isn't redheaded in the movie.

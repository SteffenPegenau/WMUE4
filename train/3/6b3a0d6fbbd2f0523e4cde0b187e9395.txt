The live album is o.k.
Dave Gilmour's Narrow Way is not bad but Part II is disasterous.
I hated it!
I liked the infinity concept in the front and a display of musical instruments in the back of the sleeve.
I remember when I purchased Pink Floyd's Ummagumma on vinyl.
I also thought that I was getting a real good deal because you were getting an extra LP an no extra cost.
It looked like they were a very talented band.
Rick Write's Sysphus is not bad in the beginning however he gets bored and just hammers out any note.
Grantchester Meadows is my favorite track on the album and perhaps my favorite Pink Floyd track.
The kettle drums really stand out.
I like quality music and as I mentioned, it was very disappointing.
It reminded me of a jet fighter displaying its armenments.
The album sleeves caught my attention.
However, the more I listened to it, the more I liked it!
It was very disappointing.

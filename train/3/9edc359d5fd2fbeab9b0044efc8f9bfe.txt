I need to save my $ to pay my gas bill.I decided to go for local brand.
And I love the bones, because they contain calcium.
I forgot what I paid last time.
I can get a lot of protein and omega-3 without a lot of sodium and calories.
Give me a break.
If I indeed paid $25, I might be out of my mind that day.Yes.
Higher fat may not be bad, because it may mean higher omega-3.
I do not need boneless sardine.
I am ready to order another package.
I didn't get a raise.
If I take in a bit more calorie or sodium, I'm try to eat less of other stuff.
Why do I want to pay so many times more?
$25 for 10?
But the price tag shocked me.
I ordered a package, and have used up all 10 cans.
But a regular can of sardine is only 50 cents or even 33 cents in the grocery store.
The product tastes good, and the can is very easy to open.

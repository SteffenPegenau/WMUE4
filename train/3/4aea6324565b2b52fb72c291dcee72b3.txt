`The Lords' was not so good and I thought we should cut some of that out.
SOME OF IT'S VERY BAD.
Without the Doors Jim wouldn't have amounted to anything (especially with his lack of self-discipline).
I am a Doors freak.
Not his poetry without the music.
END
Listen to the Doors music.
That's Jim at his best.
I made some suggestions.
He was a mediocre poet at best.
(I'll admit he was capable of the occasional short gem).
Not the poetry.
This is of interest to die-hard Doors fans only.
That about sums up Jim's poetry.
I suggested taking some of it out, but he didn't.
We changed the order.
Jim's editor at Simon and Schuster who worked with him on his poetry said this (in the book THE LIZARD KING): "I found his poetry interesting.
And a Jim Morrison fan IN THE CONTEXT OF THE DOORS.
He didn't want that particularly, but we did some reorganizing."
This collection's high point is the "Road House Blues" live Doors rendition.

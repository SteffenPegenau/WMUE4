the rockabilly times of 1959-64. rockabilly in 1960?
if you are strictly a stravinsky sort of person, this will not do.
fun disc, though.
63?
futile though it may be, here is what i have to say about this cd: this is volume three of the cuca records story: a studio that operated from roughly 1959 to 1969 about 25 miles north of madison, wisconsion.
you may well ask.
no genius unearthed here, but a lot of pretty fine guitar slingers.
evidentally they were a year or two behind the times out in farm country.
if you love rockabilly, this is a nice set of obscurities for your collection.
62?
look elsewhere.
remember, this was wisconsin.
oddly enough, the 3rd volume covers the beginning years.
if you love the magic of music's ability to transport you to another time, this might be up your alley as well.
61?
and 64?

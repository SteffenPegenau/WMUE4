All wrong.
It is worth the ...price though.
Minor cons.
It just does not have the range from low to high that my previous BE100HT did.
Display contrast is low and hard to read straight on.
I use to have the Bell Sonecore BE-100HT until I dropped it one two many times and pulled the cord out of the headset.
I am happy with it.
The volume control range is limited.
The picture is correct though.
I am happy with it.
Just got the BE200HT today.
It is basically a hands free headset that connects with the phone cord and needs 4 AAA batteries.
I expect it will not last long on this one either.
It seems to be made to read at a low viewing angle.
Seems to work just fine.
The write up on Amazon at the time I posted this still mentions cordless/cell/2.5mm jacks.
The "belt clip" on the back is still the cheap plastic design that broke on my last one.
It can be adjusted to between loud and near loud.

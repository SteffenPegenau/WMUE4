felt a little dull for me.
Old 50's style drive-in terror.
A mission to Mars is distrupted by an 'IT' thing.
Will they ever make it to Mars on time?Between the two movies I enjoyed 'Monster' a lot more.
This movie has French & Spanish subtitles and is presented in full screen.
The Terror from Beyond Space(69mins/1958).
'IT!'
The spaceship setting wasn't as appealing and the characters weren't that interesting.
Double-sided disc featuring two monster-type sci-fi oldies.
Both prints are clear.
This movie also contains French & Spanish subtitles as well as the original theatrical trailer with some "subliminal messages" and is presented in full screen .
Also, the creature from 'Monster' is 'better' looking..just my opinion.
The pace was quicker and I could get into the characters.
Side A features The Monster that Challenged the World(84mins/1957).
Giant snail-like creatures invade Catalina Island!
What will the military do to stop them?Side B features IT!

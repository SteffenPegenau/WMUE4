the settings and people are described in great detail.
It is a good story that could have been great.
Ms.Lindsey would build up to them, and then move on to another part of the story.
They were more like secondary characters.
A computer named Martha seemed more like the main character.
Heart of a Warrior left me with mixed feelings.
Also, some of the major moments were left out.
Overall, don't expect the intersity associated with this author.
I have read all of Johanna Lindseys books.
It seems incomplete.
This book left me wanting more.
Also, we get to revisit Challen and Tedra from the first novel in this series.
Usually, I would describe them as intense, unable to put down.
However, as a light fun read this book is fine.
The relationship between Brittany and Dalden is not exploerd in great detail.
On the positive side, This story is very easy to visualize.

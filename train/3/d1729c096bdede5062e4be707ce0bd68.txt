i have mixed feelings, mostly disappointed and bored with it, the author had a lot of problems using the american language.
now, i am also very offended by the way the author tore apart the catholic religion.
they cremated the book.
i was interested in the book when i read about it.
he misspelled alot and the punctuation was right in with it.
so, i really thought the book would be More about wales.
i was appalled.
but, that was alright, the story was interesting and very boring.
obviously, the editor is not an american.
i have friends in wales, and i have visited them.
it was too much in detail about the island and way too long.
i will not buy the other books.
i always finish what i start, so i had to bear with it, it was so boring towards the middle and end.
i blame his editor for this.
he shouldn't have done that if you ask me.

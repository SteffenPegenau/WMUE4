Forgot to review it until the recent amazon prompt today.
This one is definitely for beginners, which is fine.
P.S.
Use an amp of excellent quality from a more renound name.
I have had this guitar for over a year now.
Great price, not a terrible sound.
Nothing fabulous.
I have several guitars and have owned many previously, including electric.
Good for your first acts AT HOME.
Could've done worse.
It's just okay.
I play my others for better sound.
Helps a BIT.
It hangs on the wall mostly and looks cool with the decor.
The sound does seem to go with the intent in the brand NAME.

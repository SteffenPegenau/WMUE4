My daughter was another who had to have this.
If you scratch its lower back, it's supposed to arch up.
You really have to watch it to notice it.
It meows anytime you touch it.
I looked at EBay, and saw nothing but ripoff.
If you're smart, wait and find a store that has a demo out and see how it works.
It does do that, but only about an inch.
When you pet its back, it starts to purr.
Fortunately a Kaybee Toys got a shipment in.
Reminds me alot like the Furby.
When the head moves, you can hear the motor hum.
Like I said, my daughter loves it, but personally I think it's a waste of money.
We gave it to her for her birthday, and although I thought it was a dissapointment, my daughter loves it.
Well the 'mad hiss' it makes sounds the same as it purrs.
Believe me, there will be hundreds on the shelf after Christmas.
If you pull its tail, it's supposed to get mad.
Definitely not worth what they're selling on EBay.

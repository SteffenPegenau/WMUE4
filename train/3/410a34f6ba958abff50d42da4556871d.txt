I will never recommend or buy a Thomson product again.
They say itis not their policy.
They also settled a class action law suit two years ago in Minn. regarding faulty picture tubes.KP
Bought my TV in May.
Loved owning it.
May take another 10 days before they even find one of the parts.
It has been 2 months now and still haven't gotten it fixed.
My repair guy who was recommended by Thomson, said I should just try and get a new TV since most of the parts need to be replaced.
Then it broke.
Got off the phone today.
Thomson Electronics, who is the maker, is taking forever to replace the parts.
Circuit board shorted out frying most of the interior.
Not the repair guys fault.
Thomson doesn't like that idea.
Found out picture tube had a design flaw in it that allowed fluid to slowly leak onto the circuit board.
By the way I think they make RCA and Proscan as well.
Turned it on one day and the whole thing just popped and turned off.

It didn't fit how they broke them up.
Ethan had way too much passion and love for Justin just to go out and cheat on him.
It was all to get the "golden couple" Brian and Justin back together.
I feel cheated.Not a great season but I will definately be waiting out Season Four.
I knew he was down and out but it made no sense.Lastly, the length.
Only fourteen?
So I didn't like that.
I loved the conflict between Brian and Stockwell and the Michael/Ben/Hunter dynamic.
The seasons are normally twenty shows long.
I loved Seasons One and Two but Season Three was far from exciting.
I also wasn't a big fan of the Ted's addiction to meth storyline.
I am not big fan of that couple to begin with.
It had it's good moments.
In season one he was deeply against Blake's addiction, so why would he do it?
And I also enjoyed the focus on the drama instead of the sex but it wasn't as captivating.I hated that they had broken-up Ethan and Justin.
It made no sense.

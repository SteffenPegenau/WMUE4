I run a small preschool, of 6 children ages 2-5.
I noticed the cracks and problems the first day when one of the children asked for a lesson on it.
Hopefully it was just a bad batch and no one else has this problem.
Most of the time I feel they are very educational and made well.
The fake wood is all cracked and bits are coming off.
I buy Melissa and Doug products all the time.
Should have looked more closely before giving it to the children.Idea itself is great.
Just some of the letters I have had to take away, so they don't get hurt.
Very educational game and the children love it.
The color cover for the letters is missing or coming out on a handful of the letters.
Just really disapointed in this product.
This See & Spell is not the case.
It doesn't hold up to the high standards I have for Melissa & Doug products.
The children have had it for less then two days.
Like it skips the sanding step when it was being made.

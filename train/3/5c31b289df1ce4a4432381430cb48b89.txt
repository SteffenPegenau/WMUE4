Brendan Gleeson <the big red headed Irish guy from gangs of new york> as a Greek king?
I realize the move was made in America but come on!
But its not all bad, the action sequences are spectacular and make this DVD worth owning by themselves.
I like Pitt but he should be playing Sigfried not Achilles.
Bana comes off as truely heroic, and the most likable character of the film.
The moves suffers badly after Hectors death.
Laughable.
First of all is the terrible casting.
That is a stark contrast to Achilles vain quest for personal glory and fame.
This is a greek epic-with no greeks!
Brad Pitt as Achilles?
He fights for his country, his family , and because he has to.
The movie is pretty good for the most part but has some glaring problems.
Oncehe gets killed by the vain peacock achilles I did not have anyone to cheer for and lost total interest.
The main bright spot to this movie is Eric Bana as Hector.

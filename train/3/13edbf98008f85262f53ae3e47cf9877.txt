But not with swords or in a cool, dramatic way --- instead, he ends up sucking snake venom out of Jamie's leg.
Ick.
He finally saves Jamie's life.
Instead, the poor guy is made to suffer through one disaster after another.
But I love Roger.
Generally, I liked the book, but I hope in future volumes Roger will get the respect he deserves.
More than anything, DG's characters just draw me in; they very nearly breathe.
Singing was the only thing he was any good at!
Jamie treats him poorly (and nearly kills him, too).
He can't do anything right.
And then, the guy gets hanged and can't sing anymore.
But in the Fiery Cross he sort of shrivels up.
Roger wasn't overpowered by Brianna in the last book.
Brianna bulldozes right over him.
I kept waiting (and hoping) for Roger to be the hero.
It's the characters that I'm most interested in and frankly, I don't much like Brianna.
So I found myself getting impatient and angry with the way he was portrayed in this novel.

I guess i should also ask why is the game so short?
This game is rated mature isn't it?
In real life that is overkill.
Within a few hours i was done.If you like watching things blow up and big guns then maybe this might entertain you for a good 3 hours.
If so, then I want the full package.
HOWEVER....... it takes forever to kill someone.
I want big guns, big explosions, and blood.
Black is a very fun first person shooter.
why?
the exposions are great and the guns are alaso awesome.
5 shots to a person's chest means that you shot him 3 times while he was laying on the ground in agony.
Is that too much to ask for?
Another problem i had with this game is the lack of blood.
I hit a guy in the chest 4 times with an M5 and he is still shooting at me?
Why????

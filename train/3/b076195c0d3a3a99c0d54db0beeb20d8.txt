Lower shooting cost, no doubt.
Don't let the cover fool you.
The kills are numerous and messy.
No spoilers really possible in this all too predictable made for DVD monster flick.
It isn't a mega-huge, CGI cross between a dinosaur and a wolf.
If it had been, such a great title wouldn't have been wasted.
No new plot twists here.
But enough gore to please the average teenage fan-boy.
Over all it's your standard monster movie fair.
The daylight does hurt the suspense factor.
No nudity.
Basically, it's a genetically engineered werewolf type monster that can run around in daylight.
I like monster movies.
So,it's no classic,but it works for me!
The acting is a bit better than average.

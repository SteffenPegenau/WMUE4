I did love all the action and comedy that was told very well.
It thankfully was like the books.
Many of the aliens you fight never were in the books and made no sense.
I was worried that it would be like the TV show which I thought was terrible.
The biggest problem is you can't morph at will.
Great animation in the movies.
Why are you always jumping around as a human instead of morphing bird.
There were not enough levels and they all took place on earth.
Now for the problems with the game.
They showed what before I could only see in my mind.
The game morphs for you.
Though I didn't like the way it ended.
The levels had good graphics.
They were fun and chalenging with lots of action.
It also showed hork-bajar tougher than andalites fixing a problem with the books.
I loved the fact that there was going to be a video game.
You didn't get to play as Ax or Tobias.
I read all of them.
First of all I love the Animorphs books.

As others have pointed out, only 8 real tracks.
There are a couple of other cool songs.
It is distractingly excellent.
Then listen to track 3 and hold on to the furniture.
Listen to it a few times.
(I find it like trying to be interested in journal articles after reading the TLS.)
This is probably the best electronica tune I have ever heard.
Ok, maybe the last applies more to Ryan than this cd, but you get the point.
Buy the Cd.
This cd is like Saving Private Ryan: 20% pure sheer genius like nothing else, 40% really good, 20% mediocre, and 20% just embarrassingly bad.
But really the problem with this cd is that Lush 3-1--(Lush 3-2 is ok)--Lush 3-1 is too damn good for the rest of the album.
Program your cd-player around Lush 3-1 (track 3).
The first one is cute, the last kinda annoying.
The genius part is Lush 3-1.
So here's my suggestion.
You can't listen to the rest of the album after having heard Lush 3-1.
Be impressed.

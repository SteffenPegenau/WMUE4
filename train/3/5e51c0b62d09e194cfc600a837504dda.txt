Er..., hope.
Hmmm...
'The Given Day' is nothing more than a competent historical drama centered around the actions of striking Boston police officers in 1919.
Dennis Lehane is one of my favorite writers.
Am I glad I read all 700 pages?
But is there the wonderful dialogue Lehane is noted for?
Yes, the author obviously did research the subject well.
Anything particularly clever or memorable?
I'll give that a quiet "yes".Bottom Line: decent historical fiction is a step down for Lehane.
Yes, the characterizations are fine.
Some of his works, like 'Shutter Island', are modern masterpieces.
Nope.
Sad to say, I was quite disappointed.
So without hesitation of purchased 'The Given Day' with hope that it paralleled his better works.
Fans will be disappointed.

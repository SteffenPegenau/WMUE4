Poor Barbara, oh so country that she could not figure out that she could have left that dog and taken just about everything he owned with her.
Good for her too!I read it very fast because I felt it was entertaining.
And she can hardly afford it by herself--oh what a pity.
She is the kind of chick I hate.
Funny how they are people too.
P G County was indeed a black soap opera.
A big fabulous house and no man in it.
And had a good husband.
I found it intriguing to read about these people of "higher status".
Hopefully the sequel is even more dramatizing!!
She got exactly what she deserved.
I loved how Jolene ended up.
Has so many self esteem issues developed from teenage years, now in her thirties with a mind to steal anybody's husband because of her own insecurities about herself.
And that story of the white woman trippin because she is 1/8th black.

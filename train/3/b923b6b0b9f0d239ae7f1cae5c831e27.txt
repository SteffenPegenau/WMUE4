I'm rating these shoes with 3-stars because they are incredibly beautiful.
My foot is between a W and a M width.
It is true!
I've never experiences quite this degree of pain in a shoe before.
I LOVE these shoes.
Nor have I ever experienced pain in my 4th toe.
I have worn them several more times and they are more comfortable.
It's been 48 hours since I took these shoes off and my toes still hurt.
They are true to size.
Also, it is difficult to find a beautiful and stylish shoe in wide width.
However, I wore these shoes to a wedding and my 4th toe was in INCREDIBLE pain.
I bought a 8W.
Nevertheless, other reviewers have stated that these shoes become more comfortable with each wearing, so I gave them a chance.
These shoes come in W widths.
I am sad about this because these truly are the most beautiful shoe I've seen in a long time and I really LOVE how they look.
It is a bit strange.
I want to give them 5 stars, but this is an edited review and I can't seem to change the # of stars.

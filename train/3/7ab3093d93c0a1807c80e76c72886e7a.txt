The songs on Heavier Things are either too funk or way too slow.
#4 New Deep sounds good also, and #9 Only Heart is very good.
Songs like that and a few acoustic songs are what I liked.
But other than that there are hardly any decent songs on the album.
He needs to make more songs like My Stupid Mouth and Why Georgia.
Which is almost trash compared to his first 3 albums.
There are a few good songs on the album.. #2 Bigger Than My Body is really good.
Such as Come Back to Bed and songs like that.
There isnt a balance at all.
Especially Room for Squares and Inside the Square.
This album is a fair album.
The way he's changed from the acoustic and semi-electric... to this funk or whatever he'd like to call it.
It's a shame he couldnt even come close to topping Room For Squares.
And then some of it is killer to listen to.
They're too slow... not like acoustic slow but old and boring slow.

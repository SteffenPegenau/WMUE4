.It shut me down and is going to be a real headache to find the part and then reassemble the shaft assembly .
.Dissapointed.
dealer doesn't have a clue about its short comings - unavailability of parts .
Will probably have to order a new part they sit in.

I will have to drill out one of them - hope for the best.
How could this critical part be so overlooked regarding reliability??
The tiny set screws are soft metal and very hard to get at.
Not happy anymore!

and a cheap belt no-less!!
After one month of serious usage with my new saw, I found a two-bit belt was key to the flawless operation I had come to expect from this rugged beauty.
Absolutely rediculous its difficulty in accessing to repair .

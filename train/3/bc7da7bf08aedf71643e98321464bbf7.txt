The hooks in the songs, and the agression in the heavier parts don't seem to have that oomph!
After the old singer left the band , i was a little hesitant to pick up the end of heartache.
Was it worth it ?
Would i pay more?
But i was wrong !
While this album does sound good , frankly i was a little disappointed that the crew didn't expand on their style a little bit more.
that i was looking for.
They don't even seem like they tried to overcome it as much as put out an album that just sounds the same.
Well, i'd have to say no.
I purchased this album for about ten dollars and some change.
i just hope it gets more experimental.
their new sound and the new singer seemed to mesh very well together.
Too well , in fact.
Hell yes!
Don't get me wrong, this is an okay album and i will be buying their next effort.
Now they have set a standard for themselves , as well as their fans, that is damn near impossible to overcome.

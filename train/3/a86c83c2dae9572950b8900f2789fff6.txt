Just terrible.
So first, the good: I love the cleaner.
I am petite- just under 5'3", and I had to hunch over to use it.
The hardwoods go through the entire house, and this cleaner was terrific.
I got a bit creative and used rubber bands to attach the Bona pad to a dry mop I already own.
The pole for the mop is ridiculously short.
No film or streaky residue- I am very pleased with the cleaner.
The cleaner itself rocks.
My back burned by the time I was halfway through cleaning the floors.
If the Bona people are reading this, this kit would be 5 stars if you could just improve that mop handle!
Five stars for that!Now the bad: the mop is AWFUL.
It's a bit of a pain, but it works.
It is, as other reviewers stated, flimsy.
The wood looked conditioned, brighter, and clean.
I have an older house (1940) with original hardwoods.
The pad that comes on the mop is good.
That wasn't my main gripe, though.

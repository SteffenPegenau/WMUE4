Plus, NPH is pretty funny.
That was an accomplishment.
Never understood why I need to purchase every disc medium that's available when all I want is the 3D movie.
But I'm not.
Yeah, so I bought this based on some reviews that the 3D is one to beat for releases in 2012.
Well...
Plus, what it comes down to, unless you're a junkie, drug user type, who thinks that all humor about drug use is funny, yeah, you'll love it.
Always will.
Not a saint either, but have never done most recreational drugs used in this series.
So I often wonder... is the cost of the 3D titles high because it's 3d, or because they include 3-4 discs in each offering?
I do however, love White Castle hamburgers.
Stop.
I did find it odd that the 2D blu ray version and the DVD were melded into a single disc.
Uggg.
So I am glad they had an appearance in this.
I don't want them.
I didn't really feel all that wowed by any of it.
It would also avoid doubling up on titles I've already purchased the 2D versions of.

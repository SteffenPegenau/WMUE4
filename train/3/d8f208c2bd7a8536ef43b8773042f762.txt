Hard to say.
This is the last and final film with Sean Connery as James Bond.
The two films he made were so poorly written and poorly performed that I have to wonder, what went wrong?
Thunderball was still much better than this.
If you're a big James Bond fan then you should get this.
He's aged a bit but there's nothing wrong with that.
The worst was Timothy Dalton.
There are some scenes under water which look alot like Thunderball.
This is an adequate bond film and is worth giving a look at.
If you're a casual fan then maybe this is not for you.
I did enjoy it, it just wasn't as good as other James Bond films.
A little on the cheesy side.
Like I think the best James Bond ever would have to be "You Only Live Twice".
Then comes From Russia with Love, then second is Thunderball, Then third favorite was Goldfinger, then Dr. No.
The script is not top notch.

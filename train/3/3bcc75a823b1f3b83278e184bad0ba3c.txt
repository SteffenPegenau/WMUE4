America, predominantly white America gave you a life of fame & fortune.
I read the book.
Yes, the 50's & 60's had alot of prejudice and bigotry.
I think, however, the blessings you've received from this "hateful place" FAR out weigh the negative parts.
AMERICA!!!
Let's remember that, ok?
That was to our shame and disgrace.
A life that could only be imagined from the view of Cat Island.
Yes.
But, let's not forget, Sid, that YOU LEFT that 3rd world dump you hailed from because there was no opportunity beyond water carrier on the entire island.
Sidney spends an uncomfortable amount of time bashing American society.
Not impressed.
Again, that is to our shame as a nation.
THAT'S WHERE!!!
Did America also make you feel unloved and disrespected?
Where o' where did you go??
YOU LEFT Cat Island because YOU WANTED better than what it had to offer.
HERE!!!!
?
Don't you agree?

You're watching an Indiana Jones film...NOT Shakespeare ; )
Okay, it's nowhere near as awesome as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but, be honest, what Raiders' sequel was?
, it had it's cheese too (Indy meets Hitler?
ripping out beating hearts w/ your hand?)
C'mon!
I was RAISED on Star Wars & Indiana Jones, but I realized then that these movies were an homage to B-movie serials (I know, my old man explained it all to me ; ) They're purely for FUN!...
Falling from airplanes in a raft?...
It's all silly, comic-book based FUN!
Temple of Doom?
While tighter than ToD (Short Round... Willie...
People take these movies sooo seriously.
Last Crusade?
Hydrogen Peroxide over an open wound via the Holy Grail ?!?).
SPOILER ALERT...I wish that they would have kept the aliens space-based rather than inter-dimensional... but... WHO CARES ?!?
Relax people.

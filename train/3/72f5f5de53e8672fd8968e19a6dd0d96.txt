More effective on smaller tanks than larger.
Results usually seen within 36 hours.
No effect on my 50 gallon patio pond.
Hardly the kind of exposure that would normally foster high algae growth.
Good on my two smaller fountains / ponds (> 20 gal).
Tried it on 5 different tanks/ponds.
I have good filtration with a strong submersible pump that provides more than adequate circulation.
Stumped as to why it works so well on smaller indoor and outdoor tanks but not on a 50 gal pond.
Some sun followed by days of cloudiness.
Have tried as directed (one application per week).
Very effective on my indoor aquariums (5 gal or smaller).
Still greenish and cloudy.
Have tried increasing frequency of dosing to 2x's wk.
Have tried doubling the dose.
Local temps during this time range from 40 to 70 degrees.
Even completely drained and replaced with aged water including reco'd dose.

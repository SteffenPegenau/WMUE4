You equip magic to you to make the stats go up, then if you use the magic, your stats go down.
On major flaw of FF8, in my opinion, is the armor.
What armor?
Better storyline, I became more attached to the characters, and the magic system was better.
FF3, OH MY GOD!
We'll start with FF7.
It has great storyline, great characters and GREAT graphics.
Ok, this game is good.
Thats Whak!
If you don't have SNES, buy one so that you can get this game.
FF3 is the best of the series.
I guess, if you already have FF7 and the anthology, get this, because it is entertaining.
The characters are the best ever made, and the esper system is the best way to do magic.
Its just not as good as it was made out to be.
Thats my point, there is no armor.
I'm a Final Fantasy fan from way back, so in comparison, my opinion changes.

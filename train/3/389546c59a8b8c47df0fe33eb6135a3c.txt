It is a good weekend pack and I am keeping it for my wife.
It would be great for youth and women, but I do not feel it is a good fit for adults.
It is.
I looked at the packing materials.
This pack is listed as a 55 Liter pack.
The ad does not.
It is for women and kids.
The brochure that came with the pack clearly shows it as slim fit and lists the proportions.
He is 6'0" and weighs 220 lbs.
The ad needs to show the brochure which clearly show High Sierra packs and who they fit and size.
It has a max waist of 32".
I wanted a full sized internal frame pack for him.
This is not in the description.
I purchased the pack as a extended weekend pack for my 19 year old son.
When he took it out of the box he tried it on.
It is listed as a slim fit.
It is well made and I will keep it for my wife.

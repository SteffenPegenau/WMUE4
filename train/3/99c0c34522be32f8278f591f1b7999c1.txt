i mean, this movie had its good points: it was scary (at times) and i found it somewhat interesting.
if you do and want to see it, go ahead.
come on!!!
also this movie wasn't all that scary.
if you want a SCARY movie and you don't have a huge phobia of clowns, don't watch this movie.
(:
at the beginning it was, but i wish they would have left a little more to the imagination.
i'm a little disappointed by this movie: all of my friends said they are scared to take showers since they watched it.
i've heard that the book is better.
if you don't, then you shouldn't waste your time.
maybe you should read that instead.
you'll be interested in it for the first hour or so.
hope i helped!
but 3 hours and 7 minutes?
how can anyone stay focused for that long?

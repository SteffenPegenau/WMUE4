The director did a bad job and the screenplay could've been better.
You never see him going to the police station.
Geezz.....
First of all the acting performance of Denzel Washington is very good in this film, But that doesn't justify a good film.
This film is badly directed and written.
All he does is ride around in a car playing mister bad guy.
I was embarrassed as an African American male watching this film.
What I kept asking myself is what was his motive for doing the stupid things he was doing in this film.
You never see him in uniform.
Ethan Hawke had a couple of good scenes.
Flat out!
Now u see film isn't getting nominated for anything.
Only Denzel's performance.
Flat out.
So what's up with that?...!...
First of all they never give any proof that Denzel is actually a police officer.
Denzel doesn't make it any better saying the "N" Word over and over again.

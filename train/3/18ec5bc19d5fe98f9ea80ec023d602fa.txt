This album's decent but I think about 85% of my rock albums are better.
Inertia-4/10, 7.
Calm & Collapsed-7/10, 9.
Genius-3/10.
This Cd's better than okay but not that good, It's a Cd you would take out once in a great while because your sick of everything else.
My Goddess-9/10, 2.
Without-8/10, 3.
Lo-Fi-7/10, 10.
Here's what I gave each song out of 1 to 10, 1 being totally sucks, 5 being okay, and 10 being one of the greatest songs ever.
Irreversible-3/10, 11.
1.
Creeper Kamikaze-3/10, 8.
I thought "My Goddess" was a great song when it first came out, it's the greatest song on the album, and I expected more rock from Inertia after listening to "My Goddess" but about half the songs are more soft than the average rock song.
No Secrets-6/10, 6.
Kickout-5/10, 5.
Can't Relate-7.5/10, 4.

Though this would be better on his neck.
When he pulls it just turns him around.
Might be better on a well adjusted animal.
Chewed right through it first day.
I sewed this up where he chewed through it 2X and I use it when he’s tied up hanging out with me in the front yard.
His previous owners should have been beaten with this leash.
Who would-a thought?
period.
I didn't like the choker chains cause he would pull regardless.
Turns out a harness worked much better.
8 months of neglect and mistreatment is a hard long road.
I have a rescue lab.
Snapping the lead dog whisperer type method was useless.
Mine got shorter and shorter LOL..
He had and still has a long way to go.
Other than that soft light easy to roll-up and put in your pocket.
Not my pooch.
Not your average pooch when it comes to obedience.
He just didn't listen.

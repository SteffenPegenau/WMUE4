Now that's sevice and support!
This one does.
3)slim quite design.
What I really like about it is the sleep mode, so when your not using it you don't have to shut it off because of it wasting energy.
I contacted Amazon to return it and literally the second day a new one was on my door step.
The back up his really nice to have but the software on the drive with a back up takes up almost 80GB.
No loud noise and no reason to shut it off.
!Now the drive is nice.
When I got the FreeAgent 250GB hard drive it was dead.
I have now 3 external hard drives and this is my favorite on by far.
1) sleep mode.
2)automatic back up.
Like other hard drives there loud and don't go into sleep mode if not using it.
Very happy with the speed of file transfers and navigating the folders, where some lack.
I contacted Seagate support and they just sat there on the phone after telling them the problem.
Before the broken one got to them,lol.
I could here people in the background, so I just hung up.

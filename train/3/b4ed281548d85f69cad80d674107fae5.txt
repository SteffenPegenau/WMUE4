Don't forget that the 2 live (studio) cuts from Jump in the Fire EP were also excluded.
ENJOY, CPE
!, and there was room on the disc!
Most is still available and the rest was in print for at least 4 years (Re-Revisited).
And I mean IT!!!!
Only 5 cuts stand out.
Free Speech, It's Electric, Sabbra Cadabra, Mercyful Fate and The More I See are it.
WHAT EVER YOU DO, DON'T BUY THE CLEAN VERSION FROM THE DEPARTMENT STORES, THEY BLEEPED OUT THE PROFANITY.
Turn the page, Tuesday's gone, Astronomy and Loverman were horrible choices.
Disc two is excellent IF, LET ME STRESS IF!!!
They also left 2 Motorhead tracks off!!
Check the run time on disc 2, 9 minutes was plenty.
What die hard is still searching for those?
Disc one is ok at best.
THE BLEEPS ARE ALWAYS LOUDER THAN THE SONGS, THAT WOULD RUIN DISC 2 AS WELL.
They are either to slow or to long or just plain borrrrrrring.
You haven't bought all that material by now.

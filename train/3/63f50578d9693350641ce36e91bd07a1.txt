I bought this movie dubbed and i didn't really like it.
I just ordered the R and SS in subtitles.
i HAVE FIANALLY SEEN WHAT i'M MISSING!
It was Luna's voice didn't fit the character.
The outers sound cooler!
I never knew what I was missing!
and the dialogue is 100% better.
I couldn't stand to see Sailormoon fall anymore!
I love Sailormoon's japanese voice!
I am looking for the series in subtitles now!
And wow!
I didn't like the outers voices either.
I'm so glad I got the sub!
The sub was excellent!
I now do NOT want the rest of the series dubbed!
The music was awsome!
So I went back and got the sub.
The subtitles are so easy to read!
And I thought some of the lines were bad.

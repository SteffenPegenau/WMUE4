It's good for a game, but not for a movie.
Sara, the person that they have to save is an indrecibly annoying idiot, and it's a wonder why Sonic didn't just throw her off a cliff~~~~~~~Well, here's a brief description.
The artwork could've been better3.
Eggman threatens to kidnap Sara, the presidents daughter if Sonic doesn't save "the land of Darkness" from this reactor blowing up.
Yay.
I wouldn't really reccomend this, unless you're a kid.
So Sonic goes to "the land of Darkness", and it turns out to be a trap, and so, Sonic has to fight "Hyper Metal Sonic".
Pros:1.
It's basically like the video game - Run around.
The voices are HORRIBLE!2.
Blow up robots.
It's pretty funny3.
It needed a better storyline4.
The music is great2.
(I think it was just made for kids, so pre-teens, teenagers and adults think it's a waste of time)
The battle scenes were really goodCons:1.

Andrews fan.
This book is sort of intense.
The only reason I said it was okay was that I come from a "broken" family too.
I can polish of these books is two hours flat.
As I said before, this book is okay.
I like to read adult books.
Andrews novel, this book is not one of my favorites.
I am only twelve.
They're close enough to where I can relate to.
I still like the other novels better.
I just recently became a V.C.
This book is not a horrible book to a child like myself,(which is something I don't like to recognize.
But after reading this book I am not so afraid to admit to things).
I like books that capture your mind so that you can't put it down.
But compared to an ORIGINAL V.C.
This book was so short could probably finish the series in two hours.
These books are so short.
I like to look at books in an adult perspective though.
Some of these things are very much the same as what happens and has happened to me.

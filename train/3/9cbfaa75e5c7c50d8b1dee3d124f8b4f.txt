Willy, the main character, had a dog, and a grandfather.
It was the kind of illness that a person gets when there are money problems.
This book had many opinions.
Willy entered a town-wide race against the undefeated winner, Stone Fox.
One morning, Will woke up late.
Willy has to get some money, so grandfather will be well again.
With only Willy and his one dog, Search Light, they together try to triumph the race.
I say that it was sad, but still had some suspense.
Grandfather had become ill.
Will they win OR, will grandfather die?
All three of them lived together on a farm.
&#65533;Something is wrong.
Very wrong.&#65533; Willy went to the kitchen to look for grandfather.
Every morning grandfather would wake up early and made them all breakfast, then woke Willy up, and then they would begin their work.
Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner was okay.

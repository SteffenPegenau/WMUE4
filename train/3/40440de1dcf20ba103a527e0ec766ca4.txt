But personaly just go buy I AM LEGEND.
If you read the book you sjould watch the movie.
Also they made Charlize Theron seem like a real jerk in the movie.
Viggo did a great job.
I mean the kid actually was really annoying.
I mean come on.
That is what we came away with.
They also said that the boy in the movie was a little b**ch compared to the one in the book.
Which sucks because I like her as an actor.
After the movie we just sat their and discussed why people were missing their thumbs.
All he could say was "papa' and "ok".
The man was constantly carrying him everywhere.
It is a far better movie but again THE ROAD is ok.
My friends read the book so we all watched the movie together and they said they thought the book was better.
It was definitly a award deserving performance.
If I was dying a slow and painful death I wouldnt carry my 10 year old son everywhere.

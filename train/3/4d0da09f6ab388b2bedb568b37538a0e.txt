Its Nick Warren in his fourth Global Undergound CD.
This CD just doesn't have any fluid.
Even a bedroom DJ can perform this basic function.
I know this is a "live" album, but take a listen at Sasha's Ibiza album.
Is it worth it?
There's just this minor problem: The mixing.
I can't put it any more simpler than that.
Its also live and the mixing is fluid and a lot better than Nicks.
No doubt all tracks will have you dancing, but the transition from one track to another is at times awful.
No cheese and no anthems.
The tracks here are top notch.
Heck, some of the track aren't even beatmatch!
I recommend you borrow it from a friend.
It sucks.
Cheap shot.
Just what you expected from the Boxed boys.
Other times he just fades out one track then fades in another track.
Well, there's not much to say here.

Ok ok. Chappelle is played out.
I just think people are just so excited theres a new black comedian making a show, they assume its the best stuff ever.
Stuff is funny when it is.
People are programmed to think this is the best.
I'm tired of it.
Nothing groundbreaking here.
Not saying its bad though, I just had enough of this dude.
The stuff on here really isn't all that.
This will never reach a certain level though.
Definately overrated.
NEXT
I think this is the best this is gonna get.
The whole time the guy was telling jokes they never laughed as hard as when he said that last line.
I was watching something on HBO last night (some stand-up stuff), some guy ended his act by saying "I'm Rick James bit**", the audiences reaction was insane.
Overrated.
I think its all phony.
This goes for Season 2 also.

I was looking for a book on Cochran's germ theory of homosexuality.
Why should it arouse such outrage?
As such it is amusing rather than enlightening.
I ordered a book by his colaborator Ewald which I have not yet read.
Bailey may be wrong but no one would ever mistake this book for a serious exposition of a closely reasoned hypothesis.
It looks like some advocacy group mustered the troops to pile on.Personally I don't get it.
It is just anecdotes.
I read it in a few hours.
I haven't thought much about transexuals since I moved from San Francisco.
Bailey seems to be a mild mannered if slightly fuzzy headed minor academic.
No harm done.
I also ordered this book expecting it to be a book about homosexuality too.Instead it's about transexuality.
I can't help but suspect that there has been an organized effort to 'pack' this forum with negative reviews.
It's short and anecdotal.
It didn't seem very controverial to me.Then I read the reviews here.

I thought this would be great for her.
I got this for her Christmas present.
So she can see all the pretty patterns this kaleidoscope makes.
But I know my daughter won't even notice it.
!
When I first opened the packaged I didn't really examine it.
My daughter has lately been into looking into holes.
Or pretending her hands are glasses and looks through them.
It is very nice a good size and seems durable.
I think the overall appearance is so cute.
I am happy with their great customer service!!
But now that I am starting to wrap gifts, there is two dents on the side of it.
******UPDATE*********I was upset my product was damaged so I sent an email to the seller and they sent me a new one right away at no charge.
It made me upset that I didn't notice it.
There not huge but just upsetting that I received a defective toy.
But this gift does have a great potential!

ok i'm done forever.
i agree that the show is good, but come on people its been out for a year or so, and its the best ever?
He has 12-15 episodes out.
how can this be the best show ever?
some with repetitive skits.
HOW can dave chappelle have the best show ever?
snl has been out for what, 20 years, and though it may not be quite as 'good' now, that doesnt make chappelle show better.
dont love a show for 12 episodes.
family guy.
futurama.
this show is about 17 minutes of show, with maybe 5 of him talkin about his skits, and another 5 with horrible skits such as lil' jon (how can someone find this funny?).
please go watch the simpsons.
people posting their reviews saying its the best show ever.
show some respect for things that are good
chappelle show is not the best show on tv....in fact, daily show is better.

For such a successful lawyer he doesn't seem to have his act together, do any serious investigating etc.
He just seems to stumble onto information.
Doesn't make the character of Antonelli very appealing.I've read a couple of Buffas's Joseph Antonelli books and have yet to really feel/know any of the characters.
.
He doesn't even visit him in the asylum for 12 yrs.
FLAW?
Doesn't make any sense to me.
I mean Antonelli hired Winston cuz he thought he was the best young lawyer going and as the years go by comes to really like this kid.
Or am I wrong?Why didn't he do anything to help his good friend Winston?
Yet stands by and does nothing when Winston needs him.
What kind of a friend is that?
Wasn't he called as a witness?
Why didn't Joseph Antonelli stop them from committing Elliott Winston to an insane asylum when he was charged with Antonelli's attempted murder?
Didn't he have any say so as to whether Winston would be charged or not?
Couldn't he have refused to press charges?

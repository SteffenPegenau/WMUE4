It was being used as usual and I came in to see if they were done and smelled something electrical.
Not sure about the batteries.
Now, am I overworking them...perhaps...but one would hope for the price, they would be able to handle it.
One just stopped working.
I looked on Amazon's reviews and found a few that said the same thing.
Not sure why, but it wouldn't charge anymore.
So I will be looking for an alternative replacement to get back up to four.
Not a lot but a few.
The other one melted this weekend.
Now, should they overheat and melt when used according to instructions...um...NO.
At this point, many months later, I'm down to two.
I ordered 1 to test, then three more.
The side was melted and hot as hell.
Well, I found reviews about this product awhile back when looking to find an easy way to charge more than 76 batteries every two weeks (lots of programmable candles).
I'm just happy I was watching the progress so closely or it could have ended badly.

my computer is almost 2 years old with windows ME and lots of ram, memory, big hard drive.
some of them wont autorun.
and the Animals one we have never been able to play at all.
i ordered all the bonus packs (6 total software titles).
some of them froze up.
so try to uninstall or reinstall and that wont work either.
i have sent it back to the manufacturer and havent heard from them yet.
says it is there in programs.
even tried it on someone else's comp with same results.but i still say the problems i am having are worth the fun my son is having with 5 games.
i highly recommend them.that said, lets get on the the technical part.
but wont open no matter what.
and he doesnt even know there is a 6th game he hasnt been able to try yet.
so much learning and fun on so many subjects!
i had a lot of trouble getting them to install.
they entertain him for hours.
and even some graphic upgrades done recently.
it is like it "half installed".
and my 5 year old son loves them.

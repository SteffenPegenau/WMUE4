But, of course, you have to love flute.
A great discovery for me.
This beautiful and rhythmic music is never agressive for the listener.
Personnally, this is my last purchase of a NAXOS CD.On the whole, I give 5 stars for the performance of Patrice Gallois and 1 star for the NAXOS recording.
NAXOS does it again !!!
is astonishing.
This music of C.P.E.
But we can't heared the orchestra with clarity.
It has been confirmed after listening to this CdS on all of my CD players.
I did not know Gallois before.
He is a great virtuoso.
And you'll have two CDs at a bargain price.
The sound of the flute is very clear.
The sound of orchestra, the strings in particular, is so unclear and bad that it's ruined most of the pleasure.
This music is absolutely superb !!
Poor label.
I had some doubt about NAXOS recording.

That's a lot.
But the price.
1 Gallon, 128 fl oz.
On Google.
Then I realized.
That's over $0.35 per fl oz.
$22.50.
It was Tuscan Half Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz.
Two and one-half stars.
Looked good.
It looked good.
It just didn't add up.
And I found it - Tuscan milk.
$45.00 for 1 gallon, 128 fl oz?
Still, only half the fat and calories, but all the taste.
Darned good.
What the heck - make it three.
So, I did some checking.
I'd pay twice as much for that.
I was looking for milk on Amazon, and this just caught my eye.

In technicolor.
Watch this film and enjoy.
And That's It, Folks (as Porky Pig says).
Just don't expect a wonderful screenplay.
The costumes are incredible.
Nevertheless, this movie is pure entertainment.
Broadway man and wife split up.
But where is the story?
This is a beautiful movie.
Man and wife get back together.
The music is wonderful.
Thank You.
And you will enjoy.
Just enjoy the wonderful music, sets, and costumes.
The sets are lavish.

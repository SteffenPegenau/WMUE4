With 3 brand new AAA, 4.5v or more is too much for this baby.
The lights are now dimmer, I decide to replace the battery.
It seems to demand a voltage of 3v or slightly above.
I put the old batteries back in.
So I grab another half used battery, and put it in along 2 of the OLD ones.
Guess what, turtle won't light up with 3 brand new AAA.
If you only have brand new ones, use only 2, and use a metal paper clip to bridge the last battery slot.
They are fine, and I am puzzled.
I bought this 90 days ago (I know, exactly the length of warranty ).
The turtle is bright again!So take it from me, a befuddled father, use half run down batteries for this night light.
The turtle lights up, dimly.I pull out my multi-meter, the old batteries (3 of them) measures 3 volts.
I test each with a battery tester.
Guess what?
It works.
I tried.

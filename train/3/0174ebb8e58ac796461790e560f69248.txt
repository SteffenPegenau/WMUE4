"NM 156" is a song that's very progressive and futuristic in sound.
This second album from Queensryche is pretty good.
It's not quite as heavy as their first release, though.
It's hard rock with a progressive edge.
The intro is really nice.
All of the songs are good.
Geoff Tate does a skilled job with the vocals, too.
The Warning is respectable and worth a listen.
It's quite an interesting tune.
The Warning consists of nine tracks.
My favorite song is "Take Hold of the Flame."
The guitar playing is also satisfying.
The Warning sports good musicianship, songwriting, and production.
This is one of their best songs.
His operatic singing and falsettos are cool.

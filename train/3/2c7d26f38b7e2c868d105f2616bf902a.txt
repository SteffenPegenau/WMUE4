I've grudgingly accepted it, forcing myself to use it.
And, here I am at Amazon to get a replacement.
After two years, I still sometimes have to think about how you set it.
The timers are loud enough.
I've had this for about two years.
.but it will not be this brand.
Now I can only see one timer, not two.Again, it works.
It's easy to see the numbers.
The last time?
.
It works, I hate throwing away something that works.
And, it allows me to track more than one thing that is cooking.
So, nothing intuitive here!
Also, the magnet is not as strong as it could be.
But, it's a pain to set.
But, it doesn't work well.
My geek partner couldn't set it to save his life without reading the manual.
The display was partially ruined.
I've knocked it off of the side of the refrigerator more than once.

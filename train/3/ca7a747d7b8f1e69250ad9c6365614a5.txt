The dark one is cheap looking.
Maybe they were years ago.
They don't look right together.

They have a rustic look about them.
They are inexpensive.
It's meant to be sandalwood, but smells more like Lemon Pledge.I really like the knot, but after less than a week, it started to come undone.In this case, I got what I paid for.
I dislike the black one.I haven't noticed any rub-off residue, as I read in various reviews.
Too bad you can't scratch 'n sniff-the scent is overpowering.
I bought them as an add-on so I could get to a certain amount and get a discount on shipping.
Nor are they engraved or embellished, as the last review states.
they're OK.

Not so noble, I guess, but I *had* been looking for beads.That said, I wasn't expecting much, and so, was not disappointed.
They are as pictured.

The light one looks cool, and as the varnish wears off, I like them even more.

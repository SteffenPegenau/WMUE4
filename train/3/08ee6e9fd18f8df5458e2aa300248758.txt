The woofer material on these is probably not something great either.
Bottomline, not bad but not great either.
Let me just make my position clear..........
However, I wouldn't use this for my main HT system.
The center spkr is probably the coolest looking center channel sphr in this planet.
Yes, I could have gone for an HT system instead ........most of them come with even smaller surrounds............but I just dont like those.
The surrounds are sleek and look great on my nightstands.
Thanks for reading!
So why am I keeping it then?
These spkrs look great but the performance is pretty ordinary.
Did not wanna clutter my nightstands with big surround speakers.
Using this for my bedroom HT.
The center channel spkr in particular is not suitable for a large room.
I am not saying these are bad spkrs.
But then again, this is not my main HT so I dont care.

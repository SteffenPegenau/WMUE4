I'd agree with that.
Tons of money involved.
Girl wants to clear her name.
A bit of a twist at the end.
Well, perhaps those scenes were cut in the final edit???
You'll have to wait til the end of the movie to see it.
Eh, it's an okay movie and if you stay awake and pay attention to the plot there are times where nothing makes sense.
Guy meets girl.
He should have skipped this one.
It's not his best effort.
How'd they know that?
Yikes...The Train Robbers was among the last 10 or 15 films with John Wayne.
Millions of bad guys who say nothing throughout the film chase good guys.
Ricardo Montalban has a small part but delivers the best line of the entire film.
IMDB rates this 6.1 out of 10 based upon over 1000 reviews.
Mediocre plot, writing, acting, directing, etc.
Maybe that's why Amazon has this one free for Prime Members?

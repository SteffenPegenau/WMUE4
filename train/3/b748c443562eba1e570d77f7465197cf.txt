This was the primary reason I brought for better sounding FM.2.
Only a few stations came in without a lot of static.
I brought the Teach Hi-Fidelity from Costco today for $39 a very good price.
The problem is the clock is so bright even if I can tolerate it, my wife will probably complain it's too bright.
Remote very handy and a surprise at such a low price.
My iPod Video fit perfectly and sounded good.4.
Unfortunately I plan on returning it.The good:1.
The clock was very bright even when dimmed - would be an issue when trying to sleep.Final Comments:I might return it for another unit to see if I get better reception.
I had trouble getting good AM or FM reception.
It even had basic iPod controls.The bad (deal breaker):1.
The controls where fairly easy to figure out.5.
Sounds very good, with good base for the size and price.3.
Bright and big clock screen.6.
I tried several locations.
Excellent price.2.

Nothing to feel good about.
The book does draw you in.
I found myself caring for the characters and rooting for one over the other.
And really, I should have known.
My problem is not that the final twists of the plot are implausible.
It is well-written, and the characters are believeable and engrossing.
So, this was a good book.
However, the plot leads us on and on into what is finally a dismal abyss.
But take heed: there is no happy ending here.
This book is indeed a page-turner.
My problem is that the entire ending of the book is simply miserable.
The hallmark of Oprah's books is that they are bleak yet hopeful -- until the end, that is, when her book choices are still bleak but all hope has been unrefuteably obliterated.
No hope at all.
So finally, I was left unsatisfied even though it was a good read.
None.
It is enthralling and difficult to put down.

notIt's My Life?
Hate to disagree with the other reviewer but it's not most are 12" singles.Don't You Want Me?
notVicious Games?
notTemptation?
notToo Shy?
replaced the bad pressing that the label left on the intro.
Nice to collect oldies, but not for true collectors.
notO L'Amour, 2 minutes 50 seconds?
notWouldn't It Be Good?
No cigar here.
notThe Look Of Love?
notTalk About?
not (track I bought to replace my 12" record)Nowhere Girl?
notWe Close Our Eyes?
NOTNever Ending Story?
A Treasure but out of place with these tracks.Relax 12"Vienna 12"Steppin' Stone 12" and a treat to the ears.Overall a nice collection of tracks but far from the 12" singles that have been known from this label.
Which is really sad since I have the 12" single on "blanco y negro"A Few Highlights:Blue Monday 12"Smalltown Boy 12"Gold 12"Tainted Love Suite 12"Dance Hall Days 12"Letter From My Heart 12" tecno pop?

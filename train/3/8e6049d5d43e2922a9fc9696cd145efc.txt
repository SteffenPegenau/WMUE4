Yes.
Yes.
Seriously?!
I am not opposed to the idea of letting people know that we need to take care of the enviroment and that we need to be aware of the amount of pollution that is building up.
But dont yeah think it is a bit much to push this on our small ones?
Really?!
But the one flaw was that it is an in your face enviromental propoganda.
Go watch the movie and see what I mean.
I loved it.
Yes.
Do we need to really make it so in your face?
The movie is great!
It was cute.
Especially once you realize it.
Its just the whole enviroment twist sort of ruins it.
The movie was well done.
The movie was visually stunning.
The movie was cute.

He wants to enter his soul into a human body before he's trapped in the doll's body forever.
Give it a try.
All used well.
Brad Douriff as the killer and Chris Sarandon as the cop who killed him, round out the cast.
The doll comes to life and starts knocking people off.
Child's Play deals with a killer dying and entering his soul into a children's doll in a toy store.
Fans of her work as the mother on TV'S "7TH Heaven" will be surprised.
This movie is a lot of fun.
Catherine Hicks, who plays his mom, is the best of the bunch.
The steam was sort of missing from the sequels, but they were all enjoyable nonetheless.
At one moment it's thrilling, and the next it's kind of funny.
The doll, Chucky, is given to a little boy named Andy as a present by his mom.
Alex Vincent, who plays Andy, is not the greatest kid actor, but he's fine.
Child's Play is a simple, enjoyable little film.
Not great, but fun.
It is filled with pretty good suspense and acting.

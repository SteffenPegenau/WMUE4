!From growing up amongst the elderly who pass away to becoming a baby who doesn't remember or know anyone around him, this movie disappointed me.
Not fantasy.
Not scientific.
Not anything.
I should have saved my money.G Gupton, author.
.
NOT SO.
Certainly not worth seeing in my opinion.
I have to agree with Hollywood that this movie was excellent for scene and costumes.
Sure, two people fall in love and have a "normal" life for a brief period in time.
But the story stunk!
.
It was full of death from the very beginning.
Not realistic.
The father, who never knew his son because he disowned him at birth, was typical.If you like crying at the end or seeing depressive scenes, this one's for you.I guess I was expecting a love story.

I love ''Right To Be Wrong'', ''You Had Me'', and ''Spoiled''.
Torn and Tattered3.
Overall this is a B- album.
Don't Know How2.
This album start's off strong.
She is alot like Janis (no last name needed).
Killing Time4.
If you've every had doubts about yourself, been in a bad relationship, or want to get back with an ex your still in love with, then those songs are for you.
Not bad but not great either.
She had fullers mixed in with good songs and after awhile they all start sounding alike.Songs she Should Have Left Off1.
I really like this album.
Tracks 1-6 are the best songs on the album, everything after that is hit or miss.
The Hidden TrackAll 5 of these songs are weak and forgettable and drag the album out alot longer than it needed to be.
Sleep Like A Child5.
I don't love it but there are many good songs and I love Joss's style and voice.
Yet, the first 6 songs are great.

Choppa is corny.
I heard Ness on #2 and I was feeling it but then they cut it with Fred talkin bout sellin crack and some other nonsense.
Well, I said I wasn't going to buy it but I did.
Ennn, Fred is ok.
Babes is corny but I think she seemed to have the best attitudes despite how ghetto she was actin.
It was down hill from there.Ness is the best.
Like someone else said, it is too many people on every song.
We got it like that.
He's from Philly so I mean of course.
He sounds like a wannabe Cash Money member.
The girl that sings the hooks wit mcdonalds shaped eyebrows is aight.... At least she's goodlooking.
Everything else is just another song.
Don't listen to the CD too much you get tired of it quick.
Dylan is corny and we tall did.
I rap better than him but I didn't get a chance to audition!
But I wanted to see what they came up with.
After seeing them fight I said this is unbelievable.
All in all, I like #2, #6 is ok, and #13.

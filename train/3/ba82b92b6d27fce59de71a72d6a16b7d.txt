This movie is the best recreation of a game.
I wanted to have something pull me in.
Overall the movie is hardly scary and doesn't seem to have anything redeming.
Whether it was a character's performance on the visuals.
Despite what some people have said I can only think they have less than a 1080p t.v.
I found the movie looked really good with a crisp picture and superb resolution.
Nothing grabbed me.
This may be one of the best videogame adaptations but as far as watchability I would say go somewhere else.
From the music to the environment.
The people at Konami should use this as an example to what their next gen game should look like.
Even with some horror movies that aren't very good you still get a little comedy.
At least as far as picture.
Now after watching the PS3 trailer I really wanted to purchase this movie despite what others have said about the picture quality.
Not here.
The movie is far from award worthy but it does really utilize the Blu-ray.

You pull them out and then you pull again and the wires go back inside the sort of whatever it is.
I ended up noy using he screen protecter at all.
Maybe you were susposed to wet the squeegee but i wasn't going to take that risk.
I did that but the screen protector would just fall off.
It said pull 1 inch of the backing off and apply squeegee thingamajig.
This starter kit is ok.
You didn't really need the earphones but i like them better than the ones that come with the psp.
I couldn't figure out how to put it on.
The car adaptor is a must.
The ear phones are cool.
This kit is really just a car adaptor thing and the screen thing(but i didn't use it) since you dont need the headphones and more of a car adapter and nothing else to me.
I didn't like the screen protecter.
On long car trips you can plug it in and play so your psp doesn't need to be fully charged for the trip.
I like them especially because the wire things don't get tangled.
(even though i use the ear phones)

Some of the best songs Natalie Maines has sung.
I bought the first three Dixie Chicks cds.
If you are politically inclined and want to buy this cd for some supposed 'freedom of speech' HA!
The first I loved.
(Anyone????...
The second, I liked... the third SUCKED, I gave it away.
Don't get me wrong.
This is a COUNTRY CD....
I don't like the Dixie Chicks... SheDaisy - now that is beautiful harmony, beautiful music.
By all means, give the girls your cash....
Yeah who cares about them anyways... you can get a back up singer or an instrument player anywhere....
The fourth?
Even though a few songs are not typically country... give it up...
Who are those other two sisters anyways?
The Dixie Chicks are Natalie Maines with back up singers... Who were the Dixie Chicks before Natalie Maines?
Courtyard dogs?
But if it is really about the music... Just download the good songs (four at most) and get your money's worth.

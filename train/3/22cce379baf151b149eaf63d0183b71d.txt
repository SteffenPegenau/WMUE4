Even Anguiras is scarier!
However, the redeeming point that saves the whole film and makes it a gem is the final battle scene!
Godzilla is a hollow shadow of himself in this film.
However, the kid's voice gets on my nerves!
But the cheesiness makes for an entertaining experience!
In the red corner, weighing in at well over 1,000 tons, Godzilla and Jet Jaguar!
In the blue corner, from the farthest reaches of evil, the tag team champions, Megalon and Gigan!
I won't say what happens but the big fight is really funny!
It's not for everyone!
Hilarious!
LOL Let's get ready to rumble!
Worth the price of the tape.
While not at all scary or preachy like the original Godzilla(1956), it has its moments!
The dubbing is awful.......thankfully!
This is a highly entertaining film, even though by Godzilla standards it is one of the cheesiest!
It only adds to the entertainment!
Buy this if you like Kaiju( Japanese giant monster ) movies, or if you want a good laugh, but be warned!

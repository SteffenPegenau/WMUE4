Theymuffle all of the harsh sounds.
I left them in my hot car and ever since then, bothcushions fall out.
They don't fit into the canister tight enough.
Ifsomeone hadn't pointed it out, they would have been lost.
My workplace is noisy, so I bought these.
It's hard to understand audiobooks in my work environment.
I'm going tohave to get some Atomic Glue and glue them in.
You have to take them off every so often.Another problem.
Bothof them fell out one day when I was walking with them in my hand.
After a while, if you wear them longenough, though, your ears get sore.
After I glue them, they should be fine.I'd give them a 4 or 5 if they didn't make my ears sore, or fall apart.Recommended.
I use ear buds and place these over them.
Just make sure the cushions fit tight.
The price is right.
It worksgreat, especially for audio books.
I also use them ascheap headphones.

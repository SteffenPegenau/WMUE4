Those little fat cheeks made me want to hug her through the screen.
Yeah, I liked them.
Cute baby.
The parents.
The brother moving in.
That little girl (there were girls playing her but I'm talking about the one who cried about the penguin and laughed at her mother doing the duck hand movement) was absolutely adorable.
However, I did enjoy the sibling rivalry/love between Mikey and Julie in the sequel, but really Julie stole this whole movie.
She was very cute, and considering I have always been a big fan of Roseanne's comedy, this was an easy win for me.
The kids though?
Great comic.
I couldn't get into the grown-ups though.
Bleh.
Between the two, Mollie and James (Kirstie Alley and John Travolta) were more interesting as a couple (before all the usual complaints about being parents came into play) in the first one.
Not interested.
I haven't seen this movie in years but got a double pack of this one and "Look Who's Talking."

Love Don't Make No Sense-2 Stars12.
No One Else Comes Close (Unplugged)-4 StarsLike I said really the only songs that have potential to move up right now are Tracks 1, 8, and 12.
How Soon-3 Stars6.
Don't Wanna Be A Player-5 Stars4.
I like track 1 but when it came out it got played to death.
All That I Am-3 Stars8.
It should be said that the stars come from my iTunes rating, and are subject to change as I develop new tastes.
U Shoulda Told Me (U Had A Man)-2 Stars11.
Sanctified Girl (Can't Fight This Feeling)-2 Stars7.
No One Else Comes Close-4 Stars9.
All The Things (Your Man Won't Do)-4 Stars2.
Although it has a few songs I like a lot it only gains three stars.
Come Around-2 Stars10.
Here is how I rated each song:1.
Don't get me wrong, the songs I like I really like.
The Love Scene-5 Stars3.
So this is the second album from Joe.
Considering though I have had this album since it first came out there probably wont be too many changes.
Good Girls-5 Stars5.

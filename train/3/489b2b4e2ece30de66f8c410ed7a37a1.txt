Perhaps a little on the cheap side... maybe a whole lot.
Is the plot original?
Some teenagers on spring break and some townies face down a slasher/monster.
Not too bad if you like some gore mixed in with your computer-generated monster.
Again for this type of movie, not terrible.
(mind you I have seen some really bad effects) How is the acting you might ask?
on the "Assault of the Sasquatch" dvd, I knew this was a can't miss.
Production values?
Plot holes that manage to amuse while leaving you to scratch your head.
Being a long-time veteran of SyFy made for TV films, the fine output of "mock-busters" from the Asylum, and countless classic B-Movies this one is right up my alley.
manages to entertain the way a good bad movie will.
For a low budget film, Banshees!!!
A fun movie to watch with friends.
Are the effects any good?
Having just seen the trailer for Banshee!!!
Ridiculous character deaths abound.
Final verdict?

I guess I should read the boxes before I buy my next COLLECTION.
It's a documentary.
Especially if the quality difference isn't that noticable.
Not worth it, unless you're to lazy to build your own collection.
I just want all of his films together.
I can buy each DVD seperately and save money.
ENTER the damn DRAGON is a BRUCE LEE MOVIE.
Couldn't they settle their differences for the consumers sake.
But there's one problem I have with this collection.
It's not a collection.
If all of his films aren't COLLECTED it's not a collection.
That may be a problem as far as the movie studios see it.
I am aware that this is a compendium of Bruce lee's movies from Hong Kong.
I didn't realize it was incomplete.
I sold my so called collection to a friend of mine a day after I purchased it.
One of these DVD's isn't even an actual film.
You can skip all of the pretty packaging and Booklets.

Clear bluetooth and more than enough volume at highway speeds when using headsets.
Once you switch to an E911 type of phone, you can never go back to a non-E911 phone!
LG is a newcomer.
They've been making cell phones for a long time.
My previous Kyocera did not not have this problem.
Bluetooth range was poor and the connection noisy.
Good voice dialing system and command program.
Went through two of these from Verizon.
Whatever.
Replaced them with a Motorola E815.
My bluetooth headset was not the cause as it is clear on other devices.Not a business tool for sure.
I found this out when wanting to go back to my older Kyocera and V. would not let me citing FCC rules.
Twin speakers goofy looking.Returned both 8100's.
Tried using three different headsets at highway speeds and could not hear my callers.
Go for Motorola.
It simply works.I'm also quite wary as to why Verizon is hawking the 8100's so hard, and downplaying the Motorola, this concerns me.bpAlso..major note here!

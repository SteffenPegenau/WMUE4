The author's logic for this?
It all begin to go sour for me when her suit would stay transparent.
Sex does not equate love.
I kept waiting for the bad 1970s porn music to kick in.
I thought it started off pretty interesting, then went slowly downhill.
Things really got bad for me when it got to the point that the heroine could not possible make a mistake.
Right?
Oh, no?
She miraculously becomes a filthy rich with little to no effort.
Oh, well, you see, she worked a few months for a business mogul as his bodyguard.
Then there must be thousands of filthy rich bodyguards out there who have done the same.
Oh?
Lastly, I cannot stand when an author decides to make a couple fall madly, and I do mean MADLY in love with each other because they had sex.
Really?
Hmm...I wonder why not?
Overall, I'm disappointed.

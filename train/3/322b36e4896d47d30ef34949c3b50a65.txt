The missions are relatively easy.
I-chi-ro!
Definitely stay away from the Star Wars Bombad Racing game.

Just like I said, the graphics are beautiful, the music score is exciting and the sound quality is very good overall.
I finished the game in 3 days and returned it.
It's the best Star Wars game so far, but I found it difficult at times to maneuver the flight controls.
That was a disappointment!
I-chi-ro!
Go M's!
Basically, flight simulation needs work, but overall a fun game.
For hardcore gamers, this game is a definite rental, but for you Star Wars fans, it's worth the investment.
I wish the missions had been a bit more challenging and complex.
I think once you finish the game, replay value is low.
I found the first and final missions to be the most difficult, but once you get a handle on the controls, success is around the corner.

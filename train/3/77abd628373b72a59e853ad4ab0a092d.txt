This game might never be boring for some people.
Still good.
THe music at the end is what I think better than the gameplay music.
If you do have a gameshark, you can have infinite lives and other codes like I said up above.
B would be turbo/fireball.
A is jump (of course).
No a cloud?
The graphics for that little cheat is sort of screwy.
The bosses are ok too.
Fun if you can cheat a bit, like oh my gosh!!
4 worlds, 3 levels in each one.
This game has 12 levels right?
What can he be?
I can complete the game in 47 minutes anyways, but who cares (cheating)?
Mario is a glove?
But it is sort of funny that Mario says to a fake Daisy for the first 3 levels "Daisy, oh Daisy" after she or whatever says "Thank you Mario".
But the submarine, the airplane (are parts of the game), and the music is ok.

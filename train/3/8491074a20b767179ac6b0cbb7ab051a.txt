This is beyond stupidity.
Having said that there were fans back in the 80's who said Jake is better than Randy.
Jake is awesome but he's no Randy.
Sorry, as much as I admire his fretwork he's already been forgotten.
Ozzy's nickname during this era was "Miss Piggy".
The guitar solo is long dead.
Time to embrace Nirvana and Korn.
This album shouldn't be dismissed because Ozzy and the band embraced the horrific look of glam rock.
This is Jake's masterpiece.
What has he done since Ozzy?
Jake is not in that category.
His playing is unreal.
Some reviews here say the same thing.
The 80's are over people.
Overweight, bad costume, tons of makeup and hairspray...good God.The songs are a bit on the light side but they still rock.
Badlands?
Randy has taken his place in rock history alongside such greats as Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Eddie Van Halen, etc.

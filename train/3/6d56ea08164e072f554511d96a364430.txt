Maybe the other songs were SUPPOSED to be like that.
'It's my Life', of course!
No other song in that album could compare to it!
Well, how was it?
I don't think otherwise-it WAS a smashing hit.But what does 'it' refer to?
But anyway, I don't regret buying it, only I've heard better songs.
I thought all the songs were like that.
I generally like songs with a good beat.
'It's my life' got me really disillusioned.
Judging by the reviews all of you thought it was a smashing hit.
The others just kept dragging along.
I nagged my parents & at last they bought me this CD.
Boy, was I wrong!
Then what about the other songs?
The only songs I liked were 'It's my life' & '2 Story Town'.
I usually don't listen to Rock, but 'It's my life' just swept me away!

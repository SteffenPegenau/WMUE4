Anyway, the product does perform well.
It is fitted with a foam tip.
Just don't expect the fun factor to remain high.
Don't put a tail on it, it degrades its performace significantly.
Certainly the product looks like something made in China, but its actually made in USA!
The rocket is thin pvc pipe covered by a cheap sticker that constantly peels off on its own.
The rubber hose that connects to your air pump seems good quality.
You may want to paint the rocket with bright color to avoid losing it.
The base is all foam and is easily blown away by wind.
Still, it is high enough, I guess.
I've used it with almost no wind.
Is this what American-made products have become?
Overall, it is a decent product.
It loses its appeal fast.
The rocket goes very high, but not 1000ft as advertised.
The highest it goes is about 600ft maybe 650ft.
If you dont keep an eye on the rocket, you can very easily lose it.
The product is made of very cheap materials.

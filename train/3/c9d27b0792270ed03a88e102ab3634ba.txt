Then powers back down.
This is a great tv if/when it works.
I finally contacted the store and asked them to send me a new TV.
Thank you, Best Buy.
It powers up momentarily with no picture and no sound.
Still not good enough.
I bought this tv will a little skepticism after reading these reviews.
They're coming out tomorrow to do the exchange.
Basically, I agree with everyone.
Heh, no chance I was going to contact them and sit on a multi-thousand dollar tv that doesn't work for 2 weeks.
Instead, I contacted the Best Buy 1-888 number for service and they couldn't get out here for 1 week.
I finally got my cable provider to send down an HD signal and it displays beautifully on screen.
Soooo...
I contacted Sony and they refered me to my local service dealer.
But unfortunately, after only a few weeks of enjoyment, the tv goes out.
Sony... the jury is still out.
Monster cables helped too.

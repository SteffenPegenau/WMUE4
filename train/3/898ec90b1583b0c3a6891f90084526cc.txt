since it's free,..what the hell, i'm not paying for it online.
something i have never ever done.
i find it a bit difficult to grasp, since i cannot get far away from the base-camp.
it's a new adventure for me.
it's kinda cute.
you can forget a decent in game screen capture.this game takes me back to atari and commodore 64 days.
best you get is 800 x 600 screen.
if you're expecting to have ground level view, it won't happen.
well?
do i like it?
why did i buy it?
if you're expecting high end graphics,...this is not the game for you.
especially since i never got to see diablo 1. i find it interesting to play.
now if blizzard can just get diablo 3 put out?
what do i say?
for giggles, mainly.
wellllll?

there are some parts in the book that made me want to fall asleep when reading it, but i think that people other than me will like this book.
its about 5 children that runaway to venice italy.
like i said before, this book can be really good.
she has written really good books.
henson's first hour...
so go ahead.... try it.
its a page turner.
but in other times there are parts that you just wish were over!!
if you like mysteries, then this book is for you.
i thought that this book will be good for anyone.
i dont want to give away any important parts, so you'll have to read this book to find out more.
but cornelia funke is an amazing author.
you'd be surprised.(...).
and it will keep you on the edge of your seat.
and i think that would recomend this book for anyone out there to read it.

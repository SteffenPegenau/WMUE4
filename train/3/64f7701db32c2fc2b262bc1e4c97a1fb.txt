Laggy or glitchy or just has a lot of glitches.
Blech.
This is one of the greatest games ever made not.. Well i cant say that really.
Way too easy.
It's also easy because i can get like 500 life points from killing one storm trooper.
But after like 2- 3 hours.
Way too easy.
No multiplayer.
I am also pretty sad when i bought this because i had big expectations for this and wow it kinda sucks i rate 6.5/10.
I was killing darth vader and he was like 1 more hit till he dies.
Oh yeah one other thing it is laggy!
Then boom darth vader becomes invinsible and just stands there and you cant hit him at all!Pros: Great graphics, fun game for a little, GREAT !!!
STORY Over all its fine!Cons: Gets really boring.
So its pretty hard to die sometimes.
At first when you play it it rocks!!!!!!
It takes like a minute to load!
And did i mention it loads SO SLOWLY!
Some places are like really easy but some wow... freakin hard!
Its like the only purpose of you is to pwn storm troopers.

But come on with this live stuff,gee it has been a long time since a live cd!
Lets go guys with some talented stuff!!
Very disappointing,good line for songs.I have heard like Bruce Hornsby's"Lets make some noise"CDthat must have a 10 piece,its live and clear as a bell.
Lets get something betterthan Vapor Trails!
!
and a pure waste of money!Think twice about getting it or listen to it from your friends!MY GOD!!
I bought this CD, in such great excitment,even though I knew it was a live CD!
So ifyou are looking for clarity and separation of things,bass,vocals etc.... this is CRAP!
I can sure hear the audience,they WEREpumped!
Another live CD!
I can barely hear Geddy and his amazing bass lines.
We have the MOST TALANTED rock band,andfirst the recording is terrible!
Come on folks!
PLEASE!!
I was just about to throw itout my house windows.

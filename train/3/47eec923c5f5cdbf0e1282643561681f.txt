It smells nice... like sweet grass.
I got the package and the box was bent in half.
Poor delivery company?
The weave didn't seem secure.
The frame was weak.
I like that it "hides" laundry.
I thought... well, maybe I need to put the pieces together and no damage was done.
This was mostly assembled, and yes, the frame was bent so bad that I needed to tie it together.
It makes the laundry room look clean and tidy.
This also did not seem worth it's $75.
Poor packaging?
$40 maybe even $50, but NOT $75.
It was smaller than I anticipated.
I bought this because I didn't want to buy (or support) a plastic one for $15... they seem about the same quality.On a positive note...
I don't know.

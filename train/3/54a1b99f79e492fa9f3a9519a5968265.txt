alright.
stop trying to write music for "everybody" and write somethng for yourself... maybe you'll discover something a bit more genuine.
i worked at his high school.
plus hey, aaron's my friend and i can't dis the guy.
maverick will chew you up and spit you out... and i am guessing they did.
yet i'm 8 years older than the guy.
why?
anyhow, aaron at least youre doing it.
can't say i really dig this record but i'm happy to see he's moved on from the hardcore bands and he's actually singing.
that being said, this isn't really a bad record and if you like STP and other 90's post grunge bands... you might really like this.
we used to sit in his home econ.
I have a demo tape of Aaron's hardcore, Vegan loving band in high school.
aaahhh, good times.
then.. here he is.
the band are nice enough guys but not much originality here.
class and talk about music while my autisic student would yell at people for not like the Power Rangers.
singing??

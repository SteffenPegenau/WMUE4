The sinking scenes make you feel as though you are there.
So why aren't there any deleted scenes?
How about a director's commentary?
It is one of those very few movies that I can watch, over and over again, and never get bored.
The ONLY extra on this DVD, is the theatrical trailer.
Let me start off by saying this, Titanic is a WONDERFUL MOVIE!
This movie was named "The Most Popular Movie Of All Time."
The chemistry between the two characters (Jack and Rose) is breath-taking.
Where is the "My Heart Will Go On" music video by Celine Dion?
Not very impressive for the movie that grossed the most money at the box office in history.
But, my question is, where on earth are the extras???
Or so the back cover of the movie says.
The reason I give this DVD a three, is because of the MAJOR LACK of extras.
Can we ask for some interviews with the cast and crew?
Or maybe some Behind The Scenes Footage?
Where is the blooper real?

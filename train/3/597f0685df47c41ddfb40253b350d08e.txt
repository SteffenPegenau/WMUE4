I was bored throughout the story and as for romance, there was a touch.
Verity and Davy were likeable and there was some chemistry.
Was hoping for much more.
The characters were one dimensional and there was no depth to any of them.
After reading the Rose Garden and really enjoying the novel, I thought I'd read The Shadowy Horses.
They story didn't really flow.
The ending seemed rushed and unfinished.
I liked the Sentinel best, and he was a ghost.
The book had potential, but fell flat.
I felt they could have been developed much more, which would have made the reader identify with them more.
It was not that I didn't like the different characters, they just didn't move me.
I was very disappointed.
I had to reread lines at times thinking I've missed something.
The book seemed to have jumped for me.
I had a lot of unanswered questions.

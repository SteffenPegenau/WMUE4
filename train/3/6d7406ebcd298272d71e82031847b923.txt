She was right.
Ok.
It started out great.
Too bad.
I got it already!
I hope it gets back to the mysteries and relationship of Holmes and Russell.
It ran on forever about the rain, rocks, fog, and the travels over the moor.
We'll see.
A review I read by another reader that said this should have been read before, out of order.
OH JERUSALEM wasn't much better.
The end was abrupt and unsatisfying.
I MAY look into the next book in the series.
After reading the preceeding books in this series, I was really disappointed.
There's a lot of history in this one, but I wasn't looking for a history lesson.
Its was WET!
I'll read the sample and if it goes the same way as the last two then I'm done.
I think I should have just reread the original Hound of the Baskervilles.
I lost the thread of the story very early on.
It would have been more interesting.
The same theme of dirt, bugs, hostility.

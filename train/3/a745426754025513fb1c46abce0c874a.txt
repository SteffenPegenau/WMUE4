Product is fine.
The coffee shop says it will clean up anything having to do with coffee....but...
The price for 1 box with shipping is about 11 dollars.
I thought I was getting a bigger size box than I saw down at the coffee shop that would make it more economical to use.
It is that shipping cost that is the real surprise.
That is around 100 dollars per year!
(about 2 1/2 by 6 inches) Has 3 envelopes for 3 uses.
This box is the same small size though.
Where there is a will there is a way!
I may be missing something here (buy in bulk?)
Good if they made a bigger size.
but thought I'd pass on the warning.Update: Funny....I was at the super market the other day and saw the same box for about 3.50 as in the coffee shop.
Maybe they do but I can't find it.
If needed I will buy this at the coffee shop and skip the high shipping cost.
Says to use once per week.

The plot should have been more well-planned.
found her.
Johanna Lindsey's books are usually so exciting and well-planned.
The Malorys were simply wonderful.
This plot is nice to think about, but it just took forever to the romancing!
What happened to Lindsey's style and flair?
Borrow it from a friend or the library.
That's what I did.
)went to her friend's and Wulfric(is that spelled right?)
If I was her, I would write another Malory book.
Her previous books were fantastic, especially her Malory series.
Half the book was boring and the book picked up when Millicent(is that spelled right?
It is simply not worth the money.
The Joining was ehhh...really missing Lindsey's spark.
I recommend reading this, but don't buy it!

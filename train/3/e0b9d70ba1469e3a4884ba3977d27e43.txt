thats a completely different song.
which is a drag i know.
but the one for this film is by Moneypenny.so stop trying to find it.
and its not on any album.so hope this helps.
the opening song to the trailer and the theme for the film.
cause its not anywhere on the net.
seems they left off the best song.
but maybe one day it will be released on a format.
is called Song to the Siren by Moneypenny.
its not This Mortal Coil.
it is not on the soundtrack and it is not a single.
but again we get cheated by missing out on having a beautiful version of a classic song.it is not the chemical brothers.
their version is much more gospel sounding.
and there are several several other cover versions.
and Tim Buckly did not sing this version.
bad news i know.

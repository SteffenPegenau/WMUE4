Maybe.
Best RTS ever?
Again, graphics are terrific.
While it has its moments, it also has its problems.
I played this game for 3 days totaling about 8 hours and beat 14 missions.
Kinda of stinks to spend that kind of money for such an easy game.
Overall, I did enjoy the game.
Plus they have a bunch of icons all over the screen that block your view.
A little too easy if you ask me.
I would have liked it more if it was a little harder.
No way!
The screen movement is alot like Myth, it ... .
Some of the units are cool, but some of the air units they have can't attack anything, so why have them!
The cinematics were good as was the story.
The missions are a joke for the most part.
I expected a little more from a Sierra product especially after Half-life.
But the graphics are excellent.
Its tough to find a good line of sight and you can't get a good look at the battles going on because if move in too close, then you miss getting attacked somewhere else.
The music is also good.

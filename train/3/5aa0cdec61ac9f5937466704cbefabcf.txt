I mean $40!
Too small.
Uh, no.
Maybe that is the way a messenger bag has to be, but, well it is a little more floppy than I want.Finally, it's expensive.
Really have to work to get it in or out.Third, it's floppy.
Aesthetic?
It's got lots of usefull little pouches and pockets, which is how I like to organize my world.
Well, actually, it's kind of ugly.
I think I am going to take a black magic marker to it.
It does slap comfortably across my back and stick where I want it while riding.
It has this weird grey piping around it that -- while you can see it in the pictures -- is actually much more pronounced than that, and really ugly.safety?
Secondly, the internal pouch for the laptop is rather small -- my IBM 460 barely squeezes in it at all.
Sure.
So, I don't think it is the organizional foundation upon which I will found the rest of my life, but it is ok.
I want something really great for that kind of money.So, is there anything good?
I don't think so.

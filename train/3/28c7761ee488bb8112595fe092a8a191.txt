And when the book says that he was cremated, how do we know that, that is true.
So they don't believe he was in it.
For example, they have said that in his funeral the cascet wasn't open.
And how is it, that this is the 7th year and this movie came out this year.
What is the truth?
And the law says that if u fake ur death for 7 years and then show up, u won't get arrested/in trouble.
That's it!
But i do know one thing.
I don't believe it!
So part of me believes that he is still alive.
How would this come out after he is dead.
People have been sayin that TuPac is still alive.
And this is important: THIS IS THE 7TH YEAH THAT TUPAC HAS BEEN DEAD!
Will anyone ever know?
But from what people have been saying I am starting t obelieve it.
I'M OUT!
So the other part of me doesn't believe anything that is being said.

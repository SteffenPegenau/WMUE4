She did the revenge thing in the "First Wives Club" book.
That book was funny in a wickedly, cartoonish way.
They're all innocent victims.
I note there are 7 copies of this available used in the dollar range.
Don't waste your money.
They're not literature, but they're usually funny and diverting.
I have read several of her books and enjoyed them.
I like Olivia Goldsmith.
This one is not.
This one resurrects the same plot and then adds a cynical, hard-edged extra-dose of unfettered hatred against men.
Baloney.
I might have forgiven the plot if the women were more accountable for the choices they made in the first place.
The irony, of course, is that each of her characters neatly lines up a newer man to share her life at the same time she is revenging and dumping the first man who done her wrong in the first place.
Oh, except if one becomes a lesbian.
Silly.
What drivel...can't live with 'em, obviously Olivia can't live without 'em either.

There is nothing to make you go "wow."
The longest song here is the final cut.
The longest song is usually the best on Renaissance records.
I can't believe that just one year later (1983)they produced such an awfully average record.
By the time this synthesized nonsense finished I was clutching my head and saying "thank God that CD is finally over."
I am a dedicated Renaissance fan.
Camera Camera (1982) was great.
NO Orchestra.
I'm glad I have all the Renaissance recordings, but this one is thier weakest work and the only one that I won't be playing over and over.
The reason seems to be the fact that John Camp took over writing the songs.
There are a few fair songs on the CD.
Annie's voice is kept down.
A lot of synthesizer.
Sorry John, but it just wasn't stand out work.
As such I defied much of what I heard about their last two studio records (before the recent comeback) and purchased 'Camera Camera' and 'Time Line.'

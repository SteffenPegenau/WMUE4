Unfortunately, the movie has nothing to say.
All of the so-called decadence of the film centers around the fact that characters actually (gasp!)
There is more going on here than that.
The songs and musical numbers are brilliant, among the very finest ever put on film.
What do the Nazis have to do with the game of musical beds that makes up the plot?
But Nazis are a potent visual symbol, and they add SIGNIFICANCE to any artistic endeavor.
When you think about it, the film has a remarkably prissy attitude towards sex.
And we are intended to see this decadence as having something to do with Nazism, so are Fosse & Co. saying that sex = Nazism?
The answer: Not much.
The filmmakers want me to see some connection between the alleged "decadence" and the rise of the Nazis.
I sincerely hope not.
Not quite.
Just add Nazis, and suddenly your work has MEANING, right?
sleep with each other.
Is there one?

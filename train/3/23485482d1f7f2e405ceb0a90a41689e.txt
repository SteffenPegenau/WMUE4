As soon as he was able to reach out and grab it he did.
He is especially fond of the teethers at the end of the arms, they must sooth those itchy gums.
I received this for my third child.
He was a month old when we received it.
I highly reccomend it!
He is now 5 months old and is still interested in it, in fact he never puts it down.
Makes a great gift!
This is a great infant toy.
This is the first Lamaze toy we owned, but certainly won't be the last.
He was immediately drawn to the bright colors.
This toy also features crinkle sounds.
It keeps him entertained for long periods of time.
He loves the softness of the fabric and nuzzles it to nap.
The best part is it is machine washable, just place in a pillowcase first, then throw in the wash and comes out like new again.
The little squeaker and rattle on the other arms get a giggle out of him everytime.
!
He loves this toy so much that we attached it to his carseat.

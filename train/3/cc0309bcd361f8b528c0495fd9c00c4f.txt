It is more like 1 minute per page.
The HP is over priced for what you get.
I spend a lot of time on the road and I use a lot of different types of printers.
What is up with that?
Ink cartridge size is good, but expensive.
It is much slower that advertized at 9 PPM black.
This is a mediocre printer that is worth about $50.00.
Quality and syle is OK.
Unfortunately when a company tags a printer as a portable then the price goes up by a multiple of 200%.
This is NOT good.
Portability is OK, but not as nice as the Cannon i70.
That is with 30% text on a page.
Keeping in mind you can buy a pretty nice printer for $300 today.
Infrared printing is glitchy.
Print quality is good.
The duplex printing requires one to manually flip the pages over.

It is steel - I don't know about you, but all my computer's electrical wires and plugs are under my desk.
I wouldn't recommend it, but that's just my two cents.
1.
Probably nit picking, but aesetically it is lacking.
3.
It looks industrial.
That's not a problem if you have it for work, but for home, it doesn't feel great barefoot or in socks.
It comes all in one piece so there's no assembly.
It has a rough top to it.
I can't recommend it for a few reasons, which are probably more personal preference, but worth mentioning.
I feel somewhat mixed about this product.
For what it is supposed to do, it does it.
I just don't like the idea of mixing steel in an area of electricity.
Your feet are in a good ergonomic position.

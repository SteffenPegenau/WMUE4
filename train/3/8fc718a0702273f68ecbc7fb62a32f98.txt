Stereophonics are one of my favorite bands.I pre-ordered the album.
But from a band this talented, you expect greatness.
The first two records are classics.JEEP is good.
It's fine to evolve your sound.
But I feel the producer misfired.
It arrived, and I'm not sure what to make of it.There's a sunny, upbeat 1970's a.m. radio vibe to about half of the tracks that is totally unprecedented in their earlier efforts.
I couldn't wait to hear the album.
But I feel the lightweight, laid back arrangements will alientate many fans.
Writer, Lying In The Sun, and Size 9s.
There's a lot less Stereophonics, the rock group.
People who fell in love with the ragged exuberance of Word Gets Around and Performance & Cocktails will feel shorted.The songwriting, as always, is there.
And a lot more Kelly Jones, heartfelt songwriter.Standout tracks include Mr.
Otherwise, screw it.
I saw the acoustic tour.
But this is total abandonment.
I hope this record grows on me.

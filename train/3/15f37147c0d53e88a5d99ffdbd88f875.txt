I don't believe in the concept of selling out.
The lyrics are kind of cool; the melodies are catchy.3.
Personal bias: I really like Cornershop's last album and wanted to like this one more than I do.

What is not so good about it?
It seems to me that the album is a retread of other albums that have shown their connection to African-American music.
And I can't tell if it's using it as a crutch or a tribute.
It isn't for me this time, but it probably will be for others.
It's in some ways a little more listener-friendly than When I Was Born for the 7th Time, and usually that's a good thing.
Whatever it is, it's pretty annoying at times.4.
What is good about it?
Those wou like Midnite Vultures might like this.5.
What is the text about?
Who might like it?
A sort-of, kind-of tribute to African-American musical tradition2.

This is not to say that this didn't keep me entertained by the movie.
I found it a little hard that a man would do all of this for himself and a woman when he was taking away his child's future at the same time.
I'm pretty sure that's thanks to Aniston and Owen.Done before, could've been more, but it wasn't.
So I pretty much got my way when it came to the choice of actors in this movie.I'm not going to give anything away, but s for the plot, I found it a little far-fetched.
I've gotten tired of seeing Jennifer do her happy movies, and I'll never get tired of seeing Clive play dark roles.
Yes, I attempted to solve what was going on before the movie did.
But again, I was still entertained.
Clive Owen is amazing.
But when I watch movies like this, I want to believe it at least a little bit.
I was still entertained.
And I did.
Let me get this off my chest.
It's not really hard because it's been done before.
Yep, it's a movie.
Jennifer Aniston is amazing.

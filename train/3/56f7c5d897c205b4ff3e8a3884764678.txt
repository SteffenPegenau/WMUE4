Maybe I will try 20 minutes next time.
I microwaved it for 22 minutes.
My star rating is a 3, which means good, with 4 being very good and 5 being excellent.
The second time I used this new one I tried 2 cups of dried rice.
They are very quick and easy to use.
This my second microwave rice cooker.
The rice was still cooked just fine.
Lost points for size and skimping on the lid setup.
I think 2 cups is the max on this model.
Some of it boiled over, causing a bit of a clean up.
I will continue to use it.
Cooking 1 cup is no problem.
I had my old one for over 10 years.
This Progressive model is smaller and has one less lid component then my old one.
I never cook rice in any other way now.

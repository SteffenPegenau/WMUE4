The first thing i noticed was the lack of mid.
DO NOT BUY
While choosing my ear size i noticed that the in ear attachment were quite flimsy.
It sucks for running and any other use for that matter.
It was ok. nothing that great though.
They are not extremely uncomfortable, but they are annoyingly uncomfortable to the point that you can't forget that they are in your ears.
The first thing i looked for when i put them in is the bass.
I bought these in ear headphones for running and listening to occasionally at other times, but mainly running.
I never saw anything about that on the description when ordering.
These would be good headphones for $15 maybe $20, but not over $30.
I will be selling these to the first person that i can.
The first thing that disappointed me was the a-symmetrical cord.
decent bass and treble, but crap for mid.
Bottom line.
I am disappointed i didn't return them when i noticed the a-symmetrical cord.

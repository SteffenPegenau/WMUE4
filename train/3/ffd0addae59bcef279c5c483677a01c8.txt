Esppesily the part with motie beatle.
The book gave me a good idea of what happend during the haulacaoust.it also gave me a look into what the Jews were felling about there situation.
I found it ironic that they turned right before they were going to go into the fire.
It got very hard to follow.
I did not like all the irony in the book.
All the selectons got confusing.
I liked the book.
Iliked the violence and grim truth about the tings the jews went thrue.
I liked most of the forshadowing in the book.
In conclusion the book gave me a good overveiw of what happend during the halacaust.
I did not like the gruesome facts.
like when they threw the babes in the air and used them as mashine gun target practace.
The part when the lady yelled about the fire.
Like the burning pits, and the hangings.
It told what was going to happen next.

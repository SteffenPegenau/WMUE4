"Missing Identity"6.
"Can You Spare A Dime?"4.
"Wet Painters"3.
"Mid-Life Crustacean"7.
Well, because you get more episodes for about 25$ dollars more.
Season 3 is scheduled to come out in October, so we have about 10 months still to wait.
There are some pretty funny episodes on here but if I were you, I'd wait until the Season 3 set comes out on DVD instead.
"New Student Starfish"5.
"Krusty Krab Training Video"2.
All of the episodes on here are from Season 3.
Once all the seasons come out on DVD, all of these 8-episode DVDs will be no longer worth buying.
"The Camping Episode"That's all the episodes, hope my review has helped you.
Why?
Anyway, here are the episodes on this DVD:1.
"Kraby Land"8.

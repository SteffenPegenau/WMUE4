Wanted to add extra USB hubs.
Which was the issue.
I purchased this about a year ago maybe a little longer and lasted maybe about six months.
It just blew out on me a circuit or something.
(Im sure Targus would have sent me a replacement)The light feature is nice and the four hubs are nicely spaced.
If you read other reviews and they sound similar to mine, it shows to avoid this product.
Had similar issue with durability with the Targus Chill Pad.
Buy at your own RISK.
It def.
I purchased this to go as a tag along for my laptop.
Other then that it would be a great product.
Again maybe it was just my hub but it doesnt seem likely.
is ergonomically designed but that doesn't cut it if it cant LAST!
It was still under warranty but I decided not to go through the hassle.
I just been using the three slots I have on my laptop but in the future my purchase another brand due to this just dying on me.

Don't overpay for the name.
Mine failed after two years.
Don't be fooled.
The bass knob on the acousti-mass module was a bad spot to put it.
Not the best sound I've ever heard, but it was load sound.
M-Audio would be 3 steps up from these despite the Bose costing $100 dollars more.
The volume control on the Bose Companion 3 Series ii was one of the best I've seen.
It delivered bass you couldn't feel.
the highs were okay, but they started sounding distorted after cranking them up.
The bass module was not good.
It was nothing an equalizer couldn't fix, but it still needed it.
Mids were tinny even after two years.If you can find these for no more than $100, they are a good buy, but if you want something better, go for a Klipsch or even Logitech.
These are small but deliver so much sound.
It was so simple.
The sound was a bit tinny, and the bass would not reach so low.

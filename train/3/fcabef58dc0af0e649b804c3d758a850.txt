To be honest, one of the earrings arrived broken.
This is a very pretty pair of earrings.
You'll need to get plastic backings for the posts.
Or bend the posts to fall more tightly.
The gold is pretty flexible.3.
The chain linking is quite fragile.
The length and size is quite nice, however, and the earrings look great on.
If you don't feel confident doing this, however, these are not the earrings for you.
I have some experience working at a Jewelry store, so I was able to conduct appropriate repairs.
It's nothing that a good pair of jewelry pliars and some delicate manipulation couldn't fix.
The color is a little lighter than the picture, but I expected that.
I didn't mind this so much since I got it on sale, but others might.2.
Some things that drove the rating down.1.
They will probably fall off the ear if one isn't careful.
The stones are lighter than in the picture.

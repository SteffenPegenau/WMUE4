we all know there is only one ff and this is fear factory.
i want my grunge back.
please stop calling the foo fighters ff.
tell dave to go back to that or go away.
their first one was just a good nirvana rip-off.
they said themselves this was their hardest album.
we should have taken a cue from a drugged out dead man.
i want their music to be like grunge.
the foo fighters time and time again disappoint me.
kurt cobain told dave ghrol he didn't like his songs.
the foo fighters suck.
dave ghrol should go away for a while.
there is nothing new.
all of them are the same.
i've heard three or four songs.

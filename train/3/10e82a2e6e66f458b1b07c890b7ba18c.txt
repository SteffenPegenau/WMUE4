I grew up on this game so i have a weird bond with it.
And then, there was no going back.
I left GTA 2 for GTA3.
But if you are going to it looking for something just as good as GTA 3, go else where.
The graphics are so outdated.
Same name, but if you haven't been playing the games from the start, this one is not for you.
It must have the coolest intro scene ever.
Its fun, with a good story line.
Yes, it is a classis, just like GTA 3.
It is a gamble, You will either love it or ya wont
it was filmed in SF.
The System requirements are so low, i could play it on my 4 year old Fujitsu Lifebook!
I would reccomend this game for true diehard fans, but not very many other people.
I say, those people at Rockstar sure know what their doing.
This game is no GTA 3 i tell ya.
It is live action footage filmed with a guy that looks just like the guy in GTA3.
But after you get into the game, it is a lot of fun.

Hence, I went to work.
SOLUTION INCLUDED:It doesnt play dvds.. period.
HERE'S THE KEY PART: MAKE SURE THE CLIPS ON THE SPINING DISK ARE FULLY PUSHED OUT AND GRIPPING THE DVD.
I cut a 1in by 1in square out.
To fix the problem of non playing DVDs, I started with a heavy sheet of paper.
The end product is essentially a circle within a 1in by 1in square.
This assures that the dvd is as far away from the laser as possible, level, and secure!
Next, I placed a CD's ring in the center of the tiny slip of paper, then I used a pen to trace the edges over and over until the center popped out.
Place it in the DVD player, and press firmly.
Voila, it works!
Next comes the DVD.
Next, I put the square on the spinning ring that holds the DVD in place.
It is a snug fit.
Enjoy!
It lasted a week, then it stoped playing DVDs.
I have tried burned DVDs as well as normal DVDs, they work well with this arrangment, althought they sometimes take time to load.
Push it down all the way.

Instead, she is a shrewd businesswoman.

I believe that the songs on these tracks could all be hits if another female artist, instead of Yoko, sang and recorded them.
Unfortunately, Yoko's vocals greatly detract from the honest musicianship featured on these tracks.
.
However, unlike Yoko-san, these individuals had other musical talents that Yoko doesn't have.John's guitar work on "Walking on Thin Ice" is fanatstic.
Elephants Memory member, Stan Bronstein, plays a mean, blues Sax on "Death of Samatha."
Frankly, if I were part of an aspiring band, I would love to have Yoko Ono manage us.This collection of "greatest hits" proves this point.

well.
The musicians she has accompanying her do an admirable job.
True, there have been others with voices that were extremely limited; Bob Dylan comes immediately to mind, who were very successful.

Yoko-san should not be a recording artist.

.what can I say?

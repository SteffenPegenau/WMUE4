She said it very matter-of-factly.
This is our second stroller.
It's a great travelling stroller.
Poor quality.
Thank goodness it's our second stroller and we're not travelling soon.
Called customer services and they were not very helpfull.
I ordered a new wheel and it will take 6-8 weeks to arrive!!
It's fairly light but not so compact.
She was at the time only 3 mo and it was important for us that the stroller could recline.
Not only do you have to wait but you certainly have to pay for any damages.
But the quality is iffy.
We decided to buy it cause we go for long walks and our baby likes to nap.
I just recently stepped on the wheel and it bent.
I would now give it 2 stars for bad customer service.
This one reclines almost completely.

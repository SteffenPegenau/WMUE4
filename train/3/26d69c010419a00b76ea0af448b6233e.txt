What was with all the gunplay?
We trusted him in Hong Kong, why don't we trust him here?
But I wanted Jackie to beat down, and I got very little of that.
Maybe it had more American-accepted dialog and I suppose Chris Rock...oops I mean Tucker...was an interesting choice for a costar, but I get the feeling that Jackie was being led on in this one.
Perhaps you Jackie Chan "fans" out there forget that Jackie is a martial artist.
Why do I feel the hand of the evil Hollywood Glamourizer pulling on the strings of the action?
Jackie should always have the upper hand and creative control in all of his films.
If I wanted cops playing with their guns, I would've picked up a copy Terminator 2.
Nevertheless, this film was a bigger disappointment because I expected more.
Man did they suck!
And it's obvious.
Have you all seen his earliest films?
Where was the hand-to-hand action I love so much?
It just felt all wrong.
The first American produced Chan film.
That's just wrong.

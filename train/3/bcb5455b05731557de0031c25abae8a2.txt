She, however, appears to me more intelligent than does he.
The book is too long.
Hillary, like so many others who write about themselves, has written a book that doesn't live up to the hype.
She shows that she is not the outgoing, persuasive, salesmanlike, charming personality that her husband is.
She and President Clinton are so different.
You can't beat that for making a great team.
This probably explains why they are a team.
She does the detail thinking and the work; and he sells it.
Her bias is so incredibly displayed in this book; but, then I certainly expected that.
Charm is needed that she doesn't possess.
She shows her intellectual abilities well in this biography.
Read it if you like politics.
Her writing styly is very interesting; and especially as a conservative, you want to read every page.
This book is really more for conservatives like me than for liberals, who seem to love her no matter what.
However, it leaves her lacking in a run for the presidency.

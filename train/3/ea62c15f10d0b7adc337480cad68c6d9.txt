My lovely Australian non-sporty wife found it educational, but not gripping enough to watch all 150 minutes.
She stopped at 90.
But I do know this is a very cool movie.
I still don't know.
Can an extremely realistic portrayal of a football game, directed by no less an icon than Oliver Stone, ever match the sheer joy of an actual NFL game?
No.
Why am I such an obsessed sports fan?
Of course.
Plus, many NFL stars for those of us who would notice that sort of thing.
No.
That's here, too.
But I think she'll agree with me when I recommend it.
The celebrity life of the pro football player isn't real.
Damn fine movie.
Real.
Does it matter?
It's a good movie, with especially fine performances by Al Pacino (of course) and Jamie Foxx.
Is the total lack of subtlety in Oliver Stone's work appropriate for a football movie?

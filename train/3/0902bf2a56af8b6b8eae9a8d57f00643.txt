The direction was impressive even for Coppola.
Reeves was almost at his very worst, and considering how limited he is anyway, that says a lot.
were exceptionally well-done.
The story ... well, it veered pretty far from the book, but hey; what Dracula film hasn't?
Ryder, as usual, was totally pathetic.
The rest of the actors were plug-ins that could've been played by almost anyone.Worth watching for the visuals, but nothing you'd watch over and over unless you're a hardcore Oldman fan
She has ZERO talent, and doesn't even look all that great.
Hopkins was very good.
Oldman was terrific.
It was still interesting with some intriguing touches.
That's what most of the 3 stars are for; the effects, the scope, etc.
The acting?
I'ne never understood why she ever made it in films at all.
Everyone else, and I mean EVERYONE, was pretty much useless.
Tom Waits was surprisingly effective.

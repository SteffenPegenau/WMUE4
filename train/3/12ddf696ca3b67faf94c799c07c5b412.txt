It did taste good, though.
I think the instructions should be clearer about when the packet gets dumped in, just in case it effects stir-ability or taste.
I don't cook often.
Stir.
Add water to fill line.
Unless it doesn't matter, and then they should at least say that.
These are the instructions on the cup: "Remove fresh flavor packet.
Stir & Enjoy."
Stir.
Microwave 1 min 40 seconds.
Let stand 5 minutes.
I ended up sticking it in at the end.
It did not seem to make a difference in flavor, but it was clumpy and hard to stir when I put it in at that point.
Cover.
Until I saw this site, I had no idea when to dump the flavor packet in.

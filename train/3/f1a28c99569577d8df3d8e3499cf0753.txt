But disc 3 blows me away.
When I got this CD I was so excited, I thought there would be all this trance and jungle, but it wasn't.
All this hip hop, it just doesn't suit me.
There are some really gret anthems.
Over all this cd recieves 3 stars.
This CD is slightly dissapointing.
I think that if I had known that it wasn't all trance i wouldn't have bought it.
Not even remotly close.
Disc one is all this dancy stuff (which isn't bad, I still listen to it in my car).
Some songs on there are so amazing.
It's a cool cd, but not that cool.
And disc 2 is just horrible.
It's always in my cd player, and blasting.
If this cd pack only had 2 cd's it would have been much better.
I tried to give the cd the benfit of the doubt, and listened for 4 straight tracks, but i just couldn't handle it anymore, and it's now been banished from being played in my car.

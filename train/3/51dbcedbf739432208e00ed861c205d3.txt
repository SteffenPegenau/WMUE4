I like it.
No multiplayer support.I got this game the day it came out.
Editor is buggy.
Useless advisors.
CIV/CIV2/SMAC just a few games to mention.
He has revolutionized computer gaming.
But sadly CIV 3 is a graphic make over.
Even additions of the resources, unique civ specific units, and culture do not make this game stand on its own.AI is lacking and very annoying (cheating too).
Sid is a great man.
Slow game play (lag between turns could take up to 2-3 min).
Constant warfare.
It is CIV 2.5.
I don't regret it.
Upgrade immediately to at least patch 1.21 if you get it.
I play it once in a while.
Anything before that is rubbish.
No real scenario support.

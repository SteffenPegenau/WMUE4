But Jamison Newlander's entire role is cut from the movie.
That and the set design's were somewhat interesting.
Thought it was suppose to be the uncut version.
Gabriella Rose is pretty believable, and Tom Savini makes a good showing.
You got a couple of funny line's along the way but there few and far between.
Could this movie have been worse.
You might to.
The dvd has some extras.
Some people thought it way cool.
The acting is just plain bad.
The background, like the ocean view's is the best part of the hole thing.
He is listed in the finale credits but isn't in the show.
In a lot of way's the extras is what pushed it up to three stars.
Music video, stuff like that.
Maybe if you take out the surfing, skateboarding, motorcycle's, and a classic car here and there.
Borrow it before you buy.

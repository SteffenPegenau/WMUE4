After 5 times with what netgear calls tech support.
I wanted to hang up.
I thought that I would get the Netgear Skype phone so that I could use it in Sydney and at home in my WiFi.
Long story short, finally the phone is going back and I am getting a replacement.
I hope that the new one will work.
My last wireless router from Netgear had a problem and I took it back.
I will not ever buy a Netgear product again.
Beware of this item.
We will see.
I was so tired of saying, "pardon me."
Actually, it sounded like it was a over crowded, dusty, hot room in India.
However, I have to pay $16.90 for shipping for Netgears faulty product.
The phone that I got is obviously defective.
I am a big Skype user and talk to family and friends via my computer with the cam and love it.
I couldn't began to understand the tech.
I just figured since Skype was behind this product, it would be better.

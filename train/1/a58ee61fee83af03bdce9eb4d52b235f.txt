this whole album is just of her whining and screaming!
all the lyrics are the same!
(except the really gay song soda pop)i'm stupid, let me be your boyfriend again.
like 311, or rage against the machine.
have you ever heard her when she's not lip-sinking, w/o electronical help?
next, this music just is soooooo stupid.
SHE CAN'T SING!!
she sounds awful!
it gets so old.
if this is what professional writers can come up with, then i don't even want to see what crap she comes up with.
This album sux, and i'm gonna tell u y.
save ur $$$$ 4 somrthing good.
peace
e-mail my heart??!
anyone who likes this trash, really needs to find help.
i've never heard someone try so hard to sing well, and never be able to.
by the way, christina is so much better than this.

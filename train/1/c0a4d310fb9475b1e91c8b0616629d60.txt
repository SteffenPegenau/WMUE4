His first CD was straight gangsta, i'll give him that, now he got songs with Joe.
anyways, G-unit is a fad cuz 50 got a body, and cuz he been shot, so everybody think he so hard.
Im glad i burned it instead of wasting my money buying it.
they wont last too much longer.
On the real, Ja would swallow 50 lyric for lyric.
Im expecting for young bucks CD to be a lot better.
dont buy this, burn it.
Maaaaannnnnn.
I dont see how everybody is liking what he has to say.
young buck needs to get down with the youngbloods or someone who can compliment his flow, cuz Banks aint cutting it.
All he does, is sing some ole 50 cent sounding hooks all through the CD.
This dude is awful.
And was talking all that mess about Ja Rule for making R&B hits.
the beats are ok, but word for word, line for line, the punch lines are lame, elementary.
5o Cent is really not that hot either.
People are beginning to get caught up into whats in the top 10 on 106 and park, instead of whats really hot.

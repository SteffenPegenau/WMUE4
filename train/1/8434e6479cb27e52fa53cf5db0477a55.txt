OH YEAH,WE ARE AND HE DOES!
BUT BECAUSE KERRY SPOKE OUT ABOUT THE EXAMPLES OF INHUMANITY SOME OF OUR FORCES WERE CAPABLE OF, THIS GROUP OF GUYS, MOST OF WHOM NEVER SAW KERRY IN VIETNAM, DECIDE TO EXACT A LITTLE "PAYBACK" ON "THE TRAITOR", KERRY.
ROVE'S THIS GROUPS BEHIND THE SCENES DIRECTOR.
KERRY HAS NO RIGHT TO TELL THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ABOUT THAT!
AMERICA?
WHAT?
THE AUTHOR,JOHN ONEILL,AND THE SWIFT BOAT VETERANS COMING UP WITH THESE "FACTS" ABOUT KERRY'S MILITARY EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE POLYGRAPHED.
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU MEAN SOME OF OUR TROOPS DID RAZE AND RAVAGE IN REVENGE FOR SEEING THEIR FRIENDS BLOWN APART?
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A "CHIP ON SHOULDER" MENTALITY PRESENT IN THIS WORK OF VENDETTA.
WAIT A MINUTE, HE DOES HAVE THAT RIGHT?
IT'S EVIDENT MOST VIETNAM VETS DID THE ABSOLUTE BEST THEY COULD IN SUCH A QUAGMIRE.
AND IT IS TRULY UNBELIEVABLE!
WHERE THE HELL ARE WE?
I GUESS KERRY'S COMMENTS ON ATTROCITIES IN VIETNAM HAVE PROVEN TO BE FALSE AS WELL.
WHAT?

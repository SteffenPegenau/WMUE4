Truly annoying.
The vocals are stupid.
And even though when I gave their earlier stuff a listen I was as bored with them as I am with Linkin Park, I still got the new one.
I really, really tried to like this.
The songs are completely unmoving.
I know most people are going to disagree with me, but just like the James Blunt fans ( I like LOG more than Blunt, I'll give them that), they are deluded.
Really.
They aren't even easy to like a little bit because of the stupid stupid vocals.
LOG is, overall, NOT THAT GOOD.
There are truly good moments on this album, I agree, but this band is NOT the great band people claim they are.
And even though the guitar is very good, very strong, the songs are very unoriginal.
They are not distinguished.
I read the reviews of this album, and they were good.
They butcher every song.
Lastly they sound like they are just regurgitating metal cliches in every song.
I've been listening to metal for over a decade.

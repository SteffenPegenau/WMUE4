The same people who loathed Carrey now all think he was robbed of oscar attention.
What we have here is Jim Carrey acting like himself, but not funny.
Really, I wasn't aware of that.
receits, too many of us also watched an overrated, empty movie.
Unfortunately, according to the b.o.
The only things being robbed were their common sense, and my money.
For such a great premise, there's no pay-off.
So we all watch to much t.v.?
Ed Harris is an incredible actor, but he essentially got an oscar nomination for wearing a hat.
That would be o.k, if there was any drama, but there isn't any.
Hard to believe you had people actually calling this the movie of the decade.
Where's the tension?
Of course, it didn't do well.
The "Cable Guy" had the same exact theme, but was funny, unpretentious, even poignant.
What hypocrisy.
Probably the same slumming intellectuals who thought "The Brothers McMullen" was on par with Woody Allen.
A movie for stupid people to feel smart.

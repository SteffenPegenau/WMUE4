Same old story.
Shame on you B&D.
I will not waste my time opening it up.
I'm buying a WORX, Lithium.
Like most of us suckers mine broke about the fourth time I used it.
The only reason it got a star at all is because no star was not an option.
You need a second recall and in not doing the right thing you will now lose many who use to believe in the name.
I have talked to a person at a service center.
No, you have to buy the whole motor.
He sees it in all of the GH1000's.
The gear melted, the belt shreaded and broke.
Mine rattles.
From everything I've read, it's obvious.
I'm spending a bit more for quality.
It will cost more to fix than it did to purchase because you can't buy just the gear.
The Grasshog is junk.
motor spins at higher RPM because it's no longer attached to the spindle.
No more B&D for me.

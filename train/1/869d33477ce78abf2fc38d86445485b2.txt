His Firestarting gets out of control and kills some kids?
Hunt up the Vanyel trilogy for a great read from this author!
No problem, the King steps in and imprisons her away.
The mother of the dead kid gets angry & goes a bit insane & cause problems?
No problem, his Companion channels it all away.
Lavan is a poor, picked-upon, beat-up whiner who gets all of his problems solved for him.
This book is irritating.
All he does is react; not once does he act.Pass on this one.
He can't control his Firestarting?
He's the most passive main character (I can't call him a hero -- he doesn't DO anything) I've ever read.
No problem, they kill his Companion & get him angry enough to lose control & kill 'em all.
No problem, the Heralds rescue him and then he's Chosen.
Karsites invading over the border?
Not once does he ever take control of a situation or even try to.
Not once does Lavan ever face his problems on his own.

I mean, honestly, this is soooo awful, why on earth would anyone make it this way unless it was on *purpose*?This movie is frankly terrible beyond words.
But the CGI is just TERRIBLE.
Um... wait.... that CGI is really terrible.
This might be the sort of bad little gem that actors put on at parties to laugh over; it looks like something deliberately done for schlock effect.I kind of like it.
I still sort of like it anyways.
On the other hand, it's chock full of cliches and Hollywood mythology and looks like it was excellent fun to make.
And the sets are awful.
Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin, yay!
Deliberately bad?
But...
And it's all low-budget, but well-lit.
That's a bad, bad combo.
Whoa, Egyptian curse!
I know!
It sucks.

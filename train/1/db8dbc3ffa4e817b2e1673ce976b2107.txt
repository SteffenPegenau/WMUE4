So boring I could barely get through it but since I'm not one to leave a book without finishing, I had to suffer through the nonsense.
First of all, I would like to point out that I really liked Noble Intentions which is why I decided to read Harry's story.
Please be warned!
But OMG how horrible!!
Then in The Trouble With Harry, the author changes his name to Lord Wessex.
OK, let me say that I do not review many books.
Don't waste your 99 cents.
UGH!!
But this book is SO AWFUL I couldn't resist.
Snorefest!
Harry was NOT the strong male force we come to expect in historicals.
It would be way too time consuming considering the amount of books I read.
For one thing, In MY Kindle version, Noble is known as Lord Weston.
As far as the story goes?
Can the author not keep track of her own characters or was someone in the editing dept asleep on the job?
Which is it??
I really don't want to read about a man who keeps pushing up his spectacles and how soft his belly is.
What trash!

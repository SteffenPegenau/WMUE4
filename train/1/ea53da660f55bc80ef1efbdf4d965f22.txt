These were the quotes of my friends that were said to me.
", or, "You can't put it down it is so good!".
It said it all!
I had to write a book report on the lame book, and I had to draw what I thought the cover would be.
All it was about was this Stanley guy who dug holes as a punishment for stealing a pair of famous shoes!
I was also very astonished that it has recieved the Newbery Award!
"You HAVE to read this!
So in conclusion, I am immediatly switching over to Harry Potter for real reading enjoyment!P.S.- Two Thumbs DOWN!
I mean come on!
I just drew a boy who dug holes, and mountains in the backround.
And even more, my teacher agreed!
Those quotes won't be repeated by me.
Ok, I'm a teenager, and this was supposed to be the best book of the year!
Then, he see's this mountain shaped like a thumbs up and it inspired him!
I hope that the judges won't pick something as bad next year to be the prized book of the year!
Geez!

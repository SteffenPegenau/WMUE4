Returning ASAP!
I hate it, it hates me.
We used it five times.
I'm not weak, and it was bad on my shoulder and hand.
Then when you want to take out the fruit, you have to finagle it up and it's a mess.
Even when rolling the oranges and lemons, making them as soft as can be, it is impossible to use.
I tried to squish strawberries and raspberries.
Good luck squishing it all the way down.
What a joke.
WHY.
It came with flattening tool.
You have to balance the bottom, while swinging the top.
Small suction cups are worthless.
The fifth time, the screw that holds the handle on, sheared right off.
It always gets stuck.

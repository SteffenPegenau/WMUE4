And their customer relations are equally problematic.
On one hand, this gave the best shave ever.
So I bought another 8894XL at the duty-free store; it was much more expensive than from Amazon, but maybe the Philipshave version will last longer.
I bought the 8894XL primarily for its long battery life (I travel internationally for weeks at a time).
Clearly, from my experience (and the experiences of others who have written reviews), Norelco has major quality control issues.

The head assembly fell out of the body and could not be put back together.
BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND.
I have used Norelco products for 30 years.

.
.
After less than three weeks of use, it fell apart.
Upon my return, I called Norelco customer service; but that is another story.
Literally.
.
Of course, I was in Asia with more than a week left on my trip.
For a shaver that lists for 320USD, this is ridiculous.

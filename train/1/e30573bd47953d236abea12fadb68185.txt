This is the first book I bought from Amazon that I got on the case of.
There have to be better books on this out there for people that want to get into it and not procrastinate on it.Any recommendations?
The first chapter was a tease to make you read until chapter 9.
The very first chapter should be...let`s get down to business!
Perhaps I should try to publish.
This book never got down to the meat of the whole issue!
You have to wait until Chapter 9 to finally get to really do anything.
Let`s make our first movie.
Sorry to pan it so much but it is useless.
We want to make flash movies.
I am going to show them how to make a simple animation, how to add to it, make changes, tweak, add key frames and plain frames and show them the differences!
Purchasing this book made me look like a dummy.
Not very nice.
I am going to make my own Flash journal for my students.
Sorry.
And still...chapter nine is missing so much.

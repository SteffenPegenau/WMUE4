I am so pissed off right now.
I just hope that no aspiring homosexual witch reads this.
I can't believe this bigot is calling himself a wiccan.
A good one is Gay Witchcraft by Christopher Penzack.
And no that was not in the book.
He claims that it is a law against nature.
Aspiring wiccans please run away and get another book.
Well homosexual activity is in nature.
So obviously he doesn't know anywthing about wicca or the rede.
As far as the universal life church goes...big deal, anyone can become a minister through there [...].
Also he is denounced by the founder of his own tradition.
Obviously he doesn't know that the rede was written in the far back ancient times of the 1970's by Lady Gwen Thompson.
Biggotry has no place in wicca.
So it looks like the author doesn't know about the nature that he is supposedly worshiping.
There is homosexual behavior in many animal species.
On top of that he is a biggot.

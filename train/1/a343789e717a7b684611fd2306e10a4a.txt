The experience I had with TomTom 910 is nothing but frustrating.
This is not waht you want when you spent $799.00.
Every time you turn it on it gives a different time from the last one.
Never turns off when the ingnition key is turned off.
The Customer service of TomTom is one of the most inefficient one.
It does not hold the time.
They say there is a fix and I can not get one !.
And not the one to spend $799.00 and get insulted !!
They have a battery problem.
A $2.00 toy seems to be more relibale.
Once over charged, it can even explode accoring to their Level-1 customer service.
Need to mannualy shut it off, which is not the way it should be !.In conclusion, this is a piece of JUNK to me so far.
The second one, I am struggling to get it worked.
You need to set up the time always.
Call them and you will be lucky to get a call back from their Level-2 in 3 to 4 days time.
The first unit I had to return as it was dead on me.

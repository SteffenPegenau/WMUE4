Maybe that will change...oh well!Pass this up!!!
I am watching part 4 now and am thinking it is going to turn out very similar to the way part 3 did.
Seriously...what were they thinking when they wrote this???
It had some genuine creepy moments that surprised me!Part 2 was OK. Definitely not as good as the first but not AWFUL.
It's the worst franchise sequel I have ever laid eyes on!
I've been having a Wishmaster marathon after having never seen any of them.
I was REALLY impressed with the first.
COMPLETELY WORTHLESS GARBAGE!!
VERY disappointing.
!
Not a scare in sight and some of the WORST, most poorly put together gore scenes ever.
It was original, gory, disturbing, and....SCARY!
Soooooooo completely lame and non-scary.
So far, it's looking more like a cinemax softcore porn then a horror film.
It still had some fun moments and was just cheesy enough to get by.This movie, however, was devoid of all scares and almost completely lacking in the Djinn department.

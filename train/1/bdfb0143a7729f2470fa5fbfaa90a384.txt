At the time I didn't attribute it to this virus packaged as a helpful program.
I took a nap.
I am questioning if I should just turn the box off now.
Gone.
Possibly the worst software I have ever intentionally installed.
I installed the Norton suite amd turn on Go Back and mysteriously my hard drive dissapeared when I tried to start up the next time.
So I reinstall everything, for the past week, preformance has been degrading.
It is now 6:50 pm.
Slower and slower.
Poof.
I had to reformat and reinstall windows xp Media edition.
I am currently laughing bitterly at the box it is on because on boot at 4:20 pm eastern, Norton went all crazy and decided to GoBack!
The damn things is at 76% and has been there since I woke up.
Everything had been peachy keen since I got the box a month ago.
Installed on a Pentium D 3.0 Ghz with 320 hard drive.

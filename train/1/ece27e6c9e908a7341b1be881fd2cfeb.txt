Spent over $30 (probably close to $40).
No matter how favorable the reviews.
If the product does not last and the manufacturer does not stand behind what it sells, the product is USELESS.
But I'm forced to give it at least one star.
Product imploded upon initial test.
SAVE YOUR MONEY!
Purchased few years ago.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!
Manufactuer refused to replace product while it was still new.
The product itself does not offer enough resistance nor give indications when to stop extracting air to form the vacum inside to marinate the meat.
Contacted manufacturer for replacement.
Manufacturer will not stand behind product.
I would not give this product any stars.
Never had a chance to test product on meat.
No gurantee.
Manual does suggest nor warn user that over pumping the pump to create the vacum can cause the plastic container to break (implode).

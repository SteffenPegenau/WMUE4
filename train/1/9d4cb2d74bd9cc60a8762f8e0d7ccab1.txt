This movie was so boring and stupid!
If I could give this movie a zero, trust me, I would.
And about 30 minutes after it started me, my mom, and my friend were the only ones left!
When I went to the movies to see it, the theater was about half full.
Everyone else had gone!
Napoleon thinks that his friend can win class President against the popular girl Summer5.
This is what the story is about.1.
Meets this new Hispanic guy and becomes his friend3.
I was falling asleep and had to be woken up when it ended.
The End (Plus, Napoleon always says "Freakin Idiot")This movie was a total waste of time.
They go to a dance6.
The Hispanic guy likes the popular girl named Summer4.
A geek named Napoleon who lives in the middle of nowhere2.
Napoleon learns to dance7.
Just goes to show, that the movie critics were actually right this time!

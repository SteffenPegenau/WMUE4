It just plain [stinks].
But I hated it.
You can't start to "care for" the characters because the chemistry just isn't there.
Sorry CLAMP, I love you girls, but this just plain BITES.
But when I saw it, MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.
I guess its one of those love it or hate em movies.
Yes, it had a lot of action and blood and magic.
What can I say?
It was one of my favorites that I was really looking forward to the movie.
I'm never queasy about any of those things.
Hey.
But it's also confusing, probably even more so if you have never even read the manga.
First of all, I love the manga series to death.
Go watch Card Captor Sakura or something.
And where's the plot?

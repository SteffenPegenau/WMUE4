i couldn't decide on weather to get SUPERMONKEY BALL or THPS3.
i put it in and started with beginner mode.
it may be a party game but it is only for kids under 8 i think.
me being the idiot i am kinda wanted SUPERMOKEY BALL and fliped a coin and ended up getting supermonkey ball.
I BEAT THE GAME IN 6 minutes and 7 seconds!
i warning u the game is terrible.
the graphics are good but the music is annoying and the game is not fun.
I got home excited to play it.
so now i'm stuck with this game and my parents are mad at me and will never lend me money AGAIN!!
as fun and cute as the 4 little monkeys may make it seem it is not worth it!
i got gamecube with a budle of 3 games which wre great.
its not fun.
i baught SUPERMONKEYBALL as my forth game with money i had to weedle out of my parents.
the first level took 7 seconds(no kidding i timed it) the other 9 levels only took me 6 minutes to beat.
!
and the toys r us that i baught it from won't even allow me 2 exchange it for THPS3.

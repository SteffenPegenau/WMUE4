And click.
And click.
And click.
And click.
And click.
Make some more random choices.
You make choices but have no idea what those choices mean or how they affect the game.
And clicked......
That's all this game is, click the button.
And clicked.
And clicked.
But it never did.
And click.
I just clicked.
And click.I kept clicking thinking at some point the real game was going to start.
Then you click.

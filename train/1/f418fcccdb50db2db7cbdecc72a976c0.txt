We finally accomplished recording to the DVD.
I have read and reread it many times.
I tried to figure out the VCR section and preprogram a channel for recording a later time.
Anything has to be better than this machine.
Forget about any onscreen help.
I think you need to take a college graduate course to understand the manual.
Please do yourself a favor and spend a little extra money on something else.
However, if you want to torture yourself then you can buy this and give yourself a migraine.
I have had the machine for over a year.
That doesn't exist.
This machine is just plain frustrating.
I will steer them away from a Magnavox as far I can.
Yeah...I have to take another college course for that too.
I am usually pretty technical having a experience as an electronics technician and as a computer LAN administrator.
My parents were looking to buy a DVD/VCR combo.

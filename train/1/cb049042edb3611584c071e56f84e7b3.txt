The natural world intrudes on the man-made one.
None of this was included.
If you're as curious as I was and are a fan of Hoffman, rent the movie before you buy.
It was terrible.
In fact, all of the major roles were miscast.
More than once, I felt that simple voice-over could have helped to enhance the film and include all of the internal activites.
Hoffman's writing is elegant & descriptive.
It just came out in 2005 & I'd heard nothing about it.
The basic plot follows the book, but that's the only recognizable element of the extraordinary novel.
I was pleasantly surprised when I found that The River King, one of my favorite Alice Hoffman books, had been made into a movie.
I bought it anyway.
I generally like Ed Burns, but he was miscast in this role.
There are legends of the past that come to play on current events.
Honestly, I did not have my hopes up though.
And I'm not generally a fan of voice overs.
Big mistake!

I wish I went with my gut and returned this piece of garbage in the beginning.
Factor that in with the extremely cheap radio its housed in and one year later its done.
It works alright but I live in orange county just south of L.A.
If you have an ipod the pioneer 4300 works great with it.
I wanted hd radio.
the most cheap feeling stereo I have ever purchased.
I had a bad feeling when this unit arrived.
Not surprising it broke so fast when you see how cheap this thing is made.
Worked ok for a while then after about 9 months various buttons started malfunctioning.
Very cheap parts.
I think I will wait until they get hd radio working better before I go this route again.
I wish I went with the pioneer in the beginning instead this unit.
It cuts out enough to be annoying.
Dual should be ashamed of making radios this bad.
I have an ipod touch.
As far as hd radio goes when its not cutting out it sounds great.
I have since bought a pioneer deh 4300 and it works great.

Or even better, there is actually a Movie on the disc!
Why?
Boy was I wrong.
When "BS" was re-released I was psyched because I thought a well-packed DVD was on its way.
Y'know the fact that it boasts sound should be considered an extra too.
Oh the choices!
Funny, "Blood Simple" gets a dud DVD and "Mummy Returns" gets the royal treatment.
Shame, on them, for letting this just shuffle out like all their other movies.
Wow, subtitles!
What a bonus!
Thanks Universal!
Everyone wants to know why I only have Horror or Sci Fi in my collection?
Boring, tepid, rip off DVDs of classic flicks like this are the answer!
I know it may seem beneath the Coen Bros. to do a commentary track or an interview but they have to wake up and, at least, insist on a more insightful release.
Fans should be paid to put this cheap afterthought of a product in our collections.
Why oh why re-release this movie and put out a lame duck DVD?
?

It is Saturday evening.
So I pulled out Truman Capote.
Maybe my concentration was off.
I pulled it out today with a smile and high hopes.Boy was I disappointed.
They will come on Monday to take it and the other garbage away.Roger
I finally decided to scan the book, and that revealed there was really nothing new here, nothing interesting.I wish I had not wasted the money.
But, as for this book, there is nothing I need to refer to later, so I'm putting it in the trash.
The thinking was sloppy and contradictory, and the writing was wooden, stiff, irritating.
I bought it a few months back and hid it in a drawer until I could get around to it.
I must be more careful.
Smooth as silk.
So it wasn't my fault.
I thought maybe I was having a bad day.
Sorry.
It was Ron's.
I hate to pile on, but I must agree with Lit Teacher on this one.

Again, REALLY BAD TECH SUPPORT!!!!
However, there are a lot of DVD writers out there that are equally as good.
!
HP is not much better but at least you could talk to a real person.
Finally, someone directed me to the audio sampling settings.
It seems so obvious now.
I bought this because the software and cables were included and I wanted to edit home movies.
Hardware solid.
The second, was due to a mechanical high pitched sound that developed with Showbiz DVD recording.
Easy enough to install.
After one month of emails and phone conversations, I was able to determine the source of two separate problems.
They do not know this software and made me reinstall it several times.
I would not recommend this product.
Arcsoft Showbiz is too buggy and the tech support is very bad.
The first was related to a known driver problem on their end.
Pinnacle is a better product for editing.

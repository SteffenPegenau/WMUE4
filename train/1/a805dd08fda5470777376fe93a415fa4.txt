You people must have had a horrfying adult life to feel that you need to hold on to the lost dreams of your childhood that made you think the Beatles were great.
I was around when the Beatles were.
Paul McCartney never had any vision.
John did, but you can see that they tried to keep him out of the loop on this album.
I'm 41 years old.
I never liked them.
That's where it's at.
I want music that means something.
And don't come back at me with some garbage saying that I'm too young to understand.
And that's what makes it complete trash.
That's why it's full of long, meaningless, ridiculous songs that don't deserve to be called Beatles stuff.
This album is obviously all over with Paul's influences.
I'm shocked and dismayed that people defend this album the way they do.
John Lennon must turn in his grave every time someone plays this album or another insane Beatles' fan defends it.
Listen to Bob Dyland and his contemporary successor, Beck.

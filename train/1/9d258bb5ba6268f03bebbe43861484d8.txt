After much time troubleshooting with customer service, they did send me a new print head which worked for about 6 months.
(and I have spent 9 years as a secretary using many, many, many printers!)
It's like it's programmed based on the number of pages, not actual ink used.
Then, back to no printing at all.
Apparently, they have a defect but still choose to sell them anyway.
As for saving money on ink.... what a crock!
WORST PRINTER I HAVE EVER SEEN.
There is no override to keep going.
WRONG!
Did not work at all most of the time.
My printer from 8 years ago produced a better photo.
I purchased this printer after seeing all the commercials on TV that told me how much I would save on ink.
Yep, $20 color cartridge that is still heavy with ink.
Photo quality is the worst ever.
AND even though most of my printing is on "draft" quality in order to save ink, it tells me I'm out and must replace the cartridge.

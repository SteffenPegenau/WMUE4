Avoid.
The vessel or plastic side material is trash.
Because there is very little soil, you will soon run into nutrition issues with this device.
Mine ripped before the summer was over.
This will limit what you hang it on.
This product is a horrid piece of trash that, at any price over free, is not worth the money.
This is a perfect example of great marketing.

Further, they are extremely heavy when filled with soil and water.
You can do better with a pot and dirt.
As a gardener, don't be wowed by this.
Hanging this dirt anchor on your house is out of the question.This product is junk.
It's not worth the money.I followed the directions exactly.

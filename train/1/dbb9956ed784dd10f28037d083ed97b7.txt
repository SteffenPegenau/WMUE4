They're awful!!
Kenshin dying of some stupid disease?
Things don't connect.
Watsuki should've taken care of that part and left us an open ending.
Now this?
Okay, to begin with, i haven't purchased this part yet.
He deserves more than that.
It's like a whole new story.
I even taped the DVDs of the episodes after the Kyoto Arc to the casing and wrote "Do not view."
Please!
You're an awesome guy, but why did you let some goof take over the series and end this wonderful story just like that?
If at all possible, pull the stuff after the Kyoto Arc and the Reflection movie out of the market and remake them.
But i've read enough to know how bad this is.
The motion picture was quite a bit boring, but it's ok.
Nobuhiro Watsuki, i hope you see this.
Please think of this Watsuki, are you there?!?!?
But the stuff after the Kyoto Arc in the series, sheesh!!
The OVAs were good, no complaints.
i've seen the OVAs and the series.
A crappy one!

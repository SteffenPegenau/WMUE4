Any true music fan, stay away from this album.
Not even fit for radio.
And yet, $8 for one good song that i don't listen to anymore?
A complete waste of time and money.
You'll die of boredom if you try to listen to it all the way through.
The rest of the album consists of sappy, cliched bubble-gum pop.
So i wasn't ripped off as bad as some.
I'm one of them.
Maybe your grandparents will like it though.
The music, the lyrics, they all suck.
Most people love it.
And to know they were Christian and yet still produced something like that- i knew i had to have this CD.But unfortunately, the old adage that a Christian band can't produce good music consistently is true.
I payed $8 for this album, before it went platinum and blah blah blah.
Even Meant To Live gets old.
Meant to Live is the only good song on here.
And SLOW, sappy, cliched bubble-gum pop.
Meant To Live- Everyone's heard it.

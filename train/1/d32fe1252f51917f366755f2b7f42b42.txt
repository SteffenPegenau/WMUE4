but I would not tell anyone about this movie.
The movie was nothing like I thought.
Very bad.
The actors and actresses werent even trying to act.You are sooo right, whomever did the first comment.
No Stars not even one from this movie, but I'm gonna be nice and give one star for effort.
Sad scene.
That was a little extra.
Ended off sad.
At all.
The plot was all screwed up.
The only thing that was important was when the girl thought she was going to get over on her man and she ended up being screwed by another guy.
(I'm talking about the brother killing the sister's husband, and the mother getting beat up.
I thought it was about her getting with another guy because of her boyfriend sexual performance, and possibly going back to him at the end, it was about that, but there was some scenes where you're like, where the heck did this come from?
Not all-independent movies are bad.
At all.
But this movie was.

You send it back at your own expense and they send you a new one.
I bought this blanket in November.
Their product is defective.
It was so nice & soft & warm.
I emailed them to refund my money.
At about 4 weeks it started blinking E3.
I loved it.
!
It was pink.
DO NOT BUY IT!
Then within a week it starts blinking E4.
Hope they do.
Then it never works again.
Costumer service is real nice.
You have to turn it off & hope it will come back on in a while.
Well my third one broke, I'm not paying to send it back.

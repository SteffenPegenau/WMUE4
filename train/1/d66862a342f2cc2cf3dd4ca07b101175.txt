The part that really angered was that I paid $22 for this piece of junk.
It was called No Ticket Required.
If you already have the VHS keep it.
I noticed that all of the sleeve notes were in Portugese.
By the VHS it will cost less, and look and sound better.
This DVD is obviously a Brazilian bootleg that has entered the American market.
I recently found this DVD and saw it had radically different packaging, even the title had been changed from No Ticket Required to All Live!
So, I warn all people whom are considering buying this DVD to not do so.
I had to turn up the volume very high to hear anything and the image was dark and fuzzy.
The DVD had been manufactured in Manaus, Brazil.
The concert is just like the old video.
It took me a while to figure where to go to start the concert.
But the image and sound quality is terrible.
I purchased this concert on VHS years ago.
I played the DVD all of the text was in Portugese including the menu.

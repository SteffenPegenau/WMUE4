But where did he go?
So where in the world did the STOry element go for FFVIII?
Once you see the ending, you'll know what I mean.Characters-two stars.
They all but eliminated the rest of the cast.Fun-FIVE STARS!
my scores:Graphics-Five stars.
It is obsessive.
Two major villains are developed great in the first two discs.
The plot was too focused on Squall, Rinoa, and love.
once you get every card, GF, and all stats maxed, there's nothing else to do but Omega.
These are the best graphics ever in an RPG.
Fantastic.Story-one star.
What makes it so fun is Triple TRiad, the card game.
Otherwise, it stinks.
I hated them.
i died twice in the entire four discs.
Then, they disappear.
Beat it in 1 1/2 months.
Seifer rocks.

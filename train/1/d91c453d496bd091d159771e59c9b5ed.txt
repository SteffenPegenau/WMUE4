After one day, a wheel is bent, and my arm is totally killing.
Just DON'T!!
I was counting on this because my younger child has special needs and will be in it for a while.
I took it on a test drive to Disney land for 6 hours.
The manouverability is rediculous.
I will.
!
This one!
In the middle of the night I woke up with the most excrutiating pain in my arm.Thinking of this one for big kids--ie, not new born?
I got this stroller from a friend, brand new.
The parent cup holder is not in a workable spot if you put your diaper bag on the handlebar.
The storage is inaccessable, um need I go on?
OK.
What stroller damages itself when folding?
Folding it is very difficult unless you're a houdini.
There is no way this stroller could hold the maximum pounds.
I have larger kids--42lbs and 28lbs.
I think that's how my wheel got bent.

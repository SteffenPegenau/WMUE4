Looks great but a BOMB.
Unfortunately asthetics will only get you so far.
It's light too... a light BOMB.
All the sudden, you can't view your files without a third party app, you can't transfer your files to a disk without a third party app.
Things you just take for granted.
I love the design of this phone.
I'm telling you, this Treo 600 phone is a BOMB!
You have to jump through hoops to check your email or print and even then it's not reliable.
Overall, this is a bust.
If you have ever used a Pocket PC device, do not buy this phone.
Imagine that you have used MS Windows all your life and you switch to something that seems to look better.
The signal is greatly improved over the previous PocketPC Phone Edition, but the Palm OS 5 just falls WAY SHORT.
Wouldn't that be awefull?
It's cute and light not even heavy enough to make a good doorstop which would be it's best use.
One thing after another keeps poping up.

Cleaned the printer heads around 10 times and ran the nozzle check.
The first 13 pictures after that came out great.
Wife and I were happy to start printing pictures.
I did a nozzle check and the color "yellow" was completely gone.
I checked the cartridge status under maintenance and it showed about 15% of ink left!
Everything came out great on the nozzle check.
We were expecting at least 50-80 pictures from the reviews posted here.
Cannot print anything without the color yellow working on the cartridge!
The pictures that printed after that started coming out very purple.
I was stunned!
Something you would expect from an economy printer.
The first picture we tried hardly printed at all.
The people in the pictures came out purple and it looked as if one color from the nozzle wasn't printing.
Complete waste of money!
Stay AWAY!!
These are the results I got...Brand new package arrived from Amazon.

No, no and no.
The characters are unformed, uninteresting and, if they had not been played by beautiful actors, probably highly unattractive.
Self-indulgent drivel on the part of Les Dardennes.
The problem is that it is artfully made, and yes, the actors are good looking, so one is seduced into thinking that this is something one should be paying attention to.
The main character starts out as a petty thief, involving small boys in his crimes, and it goes downhill from there.
They probably don't smell very well either.
I can't think of one good reason to see this film.
There is no moral, except perhaps that "crime does not pay."
Was it beautiful in any way?
Way downhill.
If you met people like this in real life, your natural reaction would be disgust and to turn away.
I used to be a big fan of French films but I think their moment has passed.
Did it illumine the human condition?
Is there any good reason for making this film?
Didn't we already know that?

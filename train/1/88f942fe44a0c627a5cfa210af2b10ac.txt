This CD is 15 songs of torture and regret -- regret of ever putting the CD in your CD player.
She's not good at pop.
This whole CD is a bad example of that bad genre.First of all, it's 15 songs.
15 songs is cool if the singer is good.
NOT Sheena Easton!
Sheena Easton is a terrible mistake in the history of the music industry.
Her voice is weak.
She's just bad at everything.
How did this woman ever get signed?
The songs are very upbeat and poppy, but with her voice, they sound weird.
It's a waste of your money.
She's a total Madonna wannabe.Please, please, PLEASE don't purchase this CD.
But Sheena is BAD.
Buy something good!
80s pop is a bad genre of music.
Don't buy this CD, it's gross.
And she's even worse at ballads.

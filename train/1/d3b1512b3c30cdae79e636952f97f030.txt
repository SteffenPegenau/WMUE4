Like the aforementioned bands, Nickelback is very bad.
And what's even more sickening is that people buy into this horrible "music".
This type of stuff is pretty sickening if you ask me.
Woohoo for them.
Other such examples are as followed: Puddle of Mudd, Default, and Staind.
Nickelback is just another slue of bands jumping on the alternative train.
But unfortunately for people with functioning eardrums, it's another story.
They're super bad and super generic.
Accompanied by bland and uninspired lyrics.
Not really though, because I would never buy this band's garbage (music).
But I bet Roadrunner is happy that they finally have another big hit after Slipknot's 'Wait and Bleed' Remix.
And the other story is sad.
No one with any musical integrity should want it.
Once again we have a band playing the same guitar riffs with virtually the same beats as all those other alternative bands.
I want it all to go away, so take your nickel back.

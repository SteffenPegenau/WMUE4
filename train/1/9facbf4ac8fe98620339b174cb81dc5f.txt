Will not power up.
Wonderful printer.
We bought our RX600 3-4 years ago.
Was never able to scan slides.
Scans successfully.
I have had to periodically unplug the RX600 to reset it to where it would boot up.
Printer cartridges are $100 about every 6-8 months.
Ink is outrageously expensive and it consumes tons of ink.
That led me to customer service - IN INDIA!!!
Prints great photos.
All kinds of problems dating back to brand new.
You get someone with a script in front of them who knows nothing about the product.
Yesterday, it froze.
I will ditch this RX600 and go back to a name I trust - HP.
I have an HP LaserJet 4P, new in 1992, still runs like a champ.
Followed the Epson on-line troubleshooting, which led me to a 562 area code number (no toll free number???).
This time, it's completely dead.
Had to unplug again.
The RX600 has been a terrible disappointment.

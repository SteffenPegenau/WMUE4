Watch this only for the music, it is a great metal rock soundtrack.
Only for the movie Deadhunters, a Spanish sort of film.Put your hand on your chin, rest your elbow on your knee and that's how you watch this movie.
It has bad bad bad acting, wanna be sexy crappy acting.Just like the made-for-you-tube-`movies'.Still bad movie, nice soundtrack, but badly placed.
Ugh!Still, doesn't everything sound better in Spanish, even with the bad translation?
It starts semi-ok, then goes horribly crappy.
Really ok few songs in the soundtrack though.
Feels like a video game around the end.
And then the ...no words for that handkerchief scene.
It starts out ok and then it deteriorates into crap.
Deadhunters, a Spanish sort of film.
Gothic feel in the costume design.
It has ok gore, but still substandard.
Because it is boring.
Dare I call it film?
At least this has somewhat better dialogue that `Dead Summer'!

I saw this as a revamped Atkins and nothing more.
I don't want to read every word in the book to find this.
I was disappointed when I found the publisher was Rodale.
Yet many of the recipes have this.
Sounds like Atkins doesn't it - only with less clarity.
The book is sort of divided in half.
I think this HAD the potential to be a good book, but the editor didn't edit or suggest.
The first half follows a lot of the Atkins mind-set.
Just follow the recipes for 2 weeks.
The index was minimal and I couldn't find what I was looking for.
The second half has sceduled meals and recipes for Phase one, two, and three.
There is no "true" instruction for the diet.
Then ends.
I'm disappointed.
What is 1 wedge of Laughing Cow Light Cheese?
Shame on you.

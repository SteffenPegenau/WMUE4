The is a toy.
When ever my buddies come over and we play, he always listens to us wide eyed.
I play electric, but I learned on acoustic.
I qent to toys r us.
I have been a guitarist since I was about 11.
Theirs were cheap and not real instruments.
I stoped at the music store where I bought most of my guitars.
They didn't cary anything that I liked.
It was getting late, so I didn't check it.
When I got home I was about to tune it.
I wanted to get him one, I stoped at Wal MArt.
They acoustic I learned on is an adult full size, which I use acasionalaly.
I grabed that guitar.
I planed to in the morning put it next to his bed.
I bought it for my son who is 6.
Either to expensive, or not good enough quality.
It was untunable, aful condition, and missing frets.

If you like daily soaps without thrilling stories, go and buy this series!
I'm a fan of Stargate, Lost and BSG.
But I know the writers are not the one's who are to blame.
This is simply bad writing.
I simply can't understand that people earn money for such a waste of time.
It's R.C.
How can they do a boring series like that?
It's really worth your money.
And one wonders why I hate SGU so much?
Cooper and B. Wright who are responsible for that... bah, I can't use the word!
But it feels like something you won't like to take in your hands, because it's soft, warm and brown.
And if television could smell, it would surely smell like it too.The concept of Stargate Universe let's me doubt the sanity of the producers.
It's disgusting!Go and watch the worst episodes of the series I mentioned above and you'll see what you get in SGU.But to be fair...
It's because it looks as good as Stargate, Lost and BSG.
I know, they can do better!
You'll like it.

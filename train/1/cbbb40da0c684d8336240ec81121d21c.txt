After the fifth or sixth charge the miles per hour drops to about 3 or 2.
I have charged it about 15 times.
I haven't had to replace the battery or anything.
This scooter sucks.
And I bought the Razor E300 for myself and my wife.
I'll have to return it and get my kids the E300 or another one like that.
I feels like I am going 16 miles per hour.
I would never suggest this to anyone.
I think the E100 is really cheap and it is built cheap too.
The E300 is so strong.
Don't waste your money on this.
And mostly all the reviewers agree with me.
I've had this Razor E100 Electric Scooter for about one month.
Now the battery has died and I called the number for razor so I can replace and they haven't even called me back yet.
Such a waste of money.
And I've had this for almost six months!
Buy the Razor E200 or E300 Electric Scooter the E100 is a waste of $100.00
I bought this for my daughter and my son.

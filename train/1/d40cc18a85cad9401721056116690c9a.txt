I had to go upstairs to get them to work.
It went from 0 to loud with barely a touch.
When I turned on my microwave the speaker screeched and the monitor was unusable.
Less than 60 ft.
Issues I found: 1.
This monitor comes in different names but is made by the same manufacturer.
The pan and tilt feature barely worked- Monitor was downstairs and the camera's upstairs.
Also beware that the newer version that has the greater pan and tilt capability isn't any better.
(I don't have wireless or a 2.4 GHz phone) 4.
If the monitor was on a table and you walked toward it (within a few feet) the display would go out and the audio would give you a buzzing noise.
This might be useful as a security monitor if it doesn't leave an a/c outlet for more than an hour and if it sits on a desk that's higher than your body.
I liked the concept but the product needs some tweaking for it to be a baby monitor.
2.
The volume control was extremely touchy.

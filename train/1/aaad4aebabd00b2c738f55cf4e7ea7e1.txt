And that last half was just awful.
It's been done before, and should have stopped while it was ahead.
Please do not be fooled.
I sat there for the first 45 minutes waiting for this movie to get good, and to pick up for that matter.
Gee, I wonder why.
We need more alien movies.
Even Amazon prices it CHEAP!
No scares, nothing.
It was obviously constructed by the Blair Witch people who took on a fail attempt here at a cabin on the lake.
..And not in a ghostly good way.
It's apparent that the cast and crew are throwing in their "good reviews" to keep the ratings up for it on Amazon to merely deceive you into purchasing it.
Yawn.
Movies like this are just getting extremely OLD and UNORIGINAL.
This movie was probably the most horrible movie I've had the "privilege" of seeing this summer.
All you see here (spoiler) is a bunch of black goop coming out of drains, and teenage adolescent nonsense.
I repeat, this movie is awful and should have never even been released.

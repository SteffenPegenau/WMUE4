It finally died.
Had this same model for years.
Losing calls(in and out).
Found this replacement on Amazon.
And this comes at a very small point in time when I have to be in touch with an elderly family member, otherwise it wouldn't be so important.
Charged it.
Anyway, it finally died as I said.
So now I'm back to "the slider".
Brand new.
Right from the get go started messing up.
Outstanding!
Inserted sim card.
I would return it, but it wasn't that expensive, and if I need one in a pinch, I'd still have one.
Nothing against Amazon.
Losing messages like crazy.
Even got it early.
But this thing is pure junk!
I like flips.
Couldn't blame it though.
Bought a coulpe of other phones (with other plans), but always had my original as a backup.

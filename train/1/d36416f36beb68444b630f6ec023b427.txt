we need more bands like Korn, well wait...
Korn will SAVE ROCK AND ROLL.
Boy, from the first single I thought it was Korn featuring Robert Plant.
Real music fans love korn.Let me rate the songs for all you::::1.
How do they figure???4.
Davis whines like my sister-3.
Make believe- Terrible.
Korn rocks, I've never been to a Korn show, but if my mother ever let me go, I would meet my boys of Korn and ask them how come they are so remarkably talented and how Davis can get his voice to sound like he was being pinched by a crawfish.
Here to stay - Terrible an absolute mockery of everything rocknroll once stood for2.
Blame - This is music?
I heard J Davis got voice lessons, cant you tell?
Hollow Life - Stop whining already..
PLEASE.....
His voice is amazing.
And Fieldy is getting so much better at the bass, and the Head guy is shredding out beautiful power chords.
I shouldn't complain, we do have Paparoach, limp biscuits...you get my point.

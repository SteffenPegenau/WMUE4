NOT US Release.
American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control".
Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market.
Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes.
No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~!
Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~!
Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ??
This what Americans are doing~!
If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production.
I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality.
And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well.
LOL
HELLO!!!??
Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~!
I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now.

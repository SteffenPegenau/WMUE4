WRONG!
I'm a computer professional who supports pc's for a living.
Incredibly stupid program!
!
Still, every week it blocks Incredimail.
If you have a wife like I do and she uses Incredimail, you're going to find that Norton constantly tries to block Incredimail from accessing the internet to check email.
I'm going to switch my wife to Trend Micro PC Cillin.
BEST PROTECTION!
So, as my title states, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!
Call Symantec to sit on the tech support phone line for twenty minutes then have some ignorant illiterate in India tell you to call Incredimail!
Norton sucks your resources and bogs down the memory and causes your system to run slower.
I can't believe how bad this program's gotten.
I thought that buying this program would provide great protection for my wife's pc.
I've added Incredimail every week for the last month to the safe access list.
Want some help?
I'm sorry to have wasted money on this program.

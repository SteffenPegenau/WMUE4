I can't remember the name, but in one song she sounds like the little engine that couldn't, trying to chug her way over a hill, and failing miserably.
It's just bad.
Okay, first off, let me say that I don't like to say that bands are awful, because everyone has their own tastes and opinions, but sometimes, someone so bad comes along that to have to speak up.
Before I say anything negative, let me also start off by saying, I really like the actual music itself.
*Ahem* Anyway, don't but this album, don't even burn it.
It sounds good and I enjoy it.
I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone, considering it's sorely lacking in good vocals...
She shouts and makes the most ridiculous noises ever.
I don't normally write online reviews, but I felt I had an obligation for this one.
Her voice is just so absolutely bad.
Her voice RUINS the CD.
But one thing kills it: Karen O.
I take that back...
She's just SO AWFUL!
Just break it into pieces, PLEASE!

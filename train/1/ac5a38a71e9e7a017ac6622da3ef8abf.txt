Grainy, extremely blurry and just a horrendous to watch.
This is not even remotely enjoyable to watch or listen to.I laugh in a hurtful way when it says bonus material.
I loved these guys in their prime and attended several concerts.
The balance is non existent.
The audio will make you cringe.
All this just ruins the experience of trying to enjoy the concert.
This is a horrible product.
Watching this concert will scar your memories.
At least they held the camera steady.
Whatever...
Hoping to relive some of the joy through this DVD.This video is just a notch above bootleg and I mean a notch.
Some instruments you can't even hear, others are too prominent.
I cannot get rid of this DVD fast enough.
It's one more song and it's recorded worse than the previous songs.
I regret reading and trusting the 'good' reviews of this DVD.
Forget about nostalgia.
The visuals are horrible.

I love Pink Floyd.
This ages badly.
It is painful.
I begged the guy who I bought it from to let me exchange it.
Where is he on this disc.
This is so bad, please stay way away from this.
I do not understand this.
I just know that I bought it used and 5 minutes into it, I ran out of the house screaming.
Aside from the no music that is on this disc, the sound is dated also.
I gave this one star, because I had to give it something to get to the body of the review.
So it is 1987 again.
There is nothing good on this.
I'm trying to stress this.
He did.
No reason to have anything to do with it.
The social commentary is just self-indulgence.
The songs have no substance, no point, nothing musically.
Roger Waters is a bass player.
The premise is silly, the music is terrible.

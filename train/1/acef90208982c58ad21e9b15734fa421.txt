It is as sharp, intelligent and bitingly funny as he is (or isn't).
You decide.
The only thing better than this book is his toupee.
He is the only man I know who wears two or three different hair pieces at the same time.
Wally George is an absolute genius.
But I digress.
Anyway, this book sucks just like Wally does.
Just like his hairpiece(s).
But his stupidity and awfulness is so great that he actually becomes funny and entertaining.
Or is he the borderline retard who doesn't know anything about politics or humor?
It also manages to capture the complex human being who is Wally George.
This book is the monument Wally deserves.
And the colors never match.
Hard to believe, but true.
All I can tell you is that watching Wally's show on Saturday nights is a bit like taking mushrooms: nothing makes sense.
(For the really bold, try doing them both at the same time; it will scar you forever).
Is he really a master performance artists who lowers himself to the level of his audience?

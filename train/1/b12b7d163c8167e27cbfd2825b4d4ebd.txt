Now, as for me being an amatuer...well, "ha!".
Obviously the honourable critic of Pittsburgh should get an eye check for not seeing that.
Because the music is nothing.
The music is so bad he needs another reason to sell.
There is no room for genuine talent.
Look at the arguments in the review from Pittsburgh: that the Scatman is good because he helped people.
The honourable critic from Madison, on the 22nd of March mentioned the Oscars.
No meaning.
Not innovative.
The only thing the Scat man inspires me to do is to shoot myself when I think about what people like him have done to music.
The fact that he's famous because of life achievements shows how commercial the music industry has become.
Nothing special.
First of all, let me clarify some points.
This will probably be my final word on this CD.
I could go on.
It is sad.
I'm sure he did, but if that is the only reason why you should buy his CD then my point has been proven.

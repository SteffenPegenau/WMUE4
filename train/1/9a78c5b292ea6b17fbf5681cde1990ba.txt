Oh, and Baby A will finish eating and wait patiently -- not spitting up or having any other issues -- while Baby B is feeding.Yeah, right!
If it naturally happens for you, that's great.
But many times both are awake at the same time and both are hungry.
At which time, Baby B will patiently and quietly wait.
This book is a joke when giving advice for parents of multiples.
Let's stagger feedings for our multiples.
Right when Baby A is finished eating, Baby B wakes up.
I would not recommend this book to parents of multiples.
Why didn't I think of this sooner?
You cannot force twins or triplets into a staggered feeding pattern.
The author obviously never spent a day with twins.
I have an idea.
What perfect timing they have.
The advice is not even close to realistic; it's actually almost comical.
And if Baby B wakes early, I'll just patiently explain to him or her that it is not his or her time to feed, so please wait until Baby A is finished.

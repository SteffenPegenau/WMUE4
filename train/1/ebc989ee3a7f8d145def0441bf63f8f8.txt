Harry FINNALY TALKS.
You get to play as Goyle but he is so annoying you cant stand yourself.
Peeves also steals Rons present to Nick.
Myrtle chucks toilet pipes at you for some odd reason.
I dont even own it and I'm already in the forest looking for the spiders.
Doby looks like a rat.
Colin Creevey is tiny, and Ginny Weasley looks like a pig.
This game is ok but the controls are horrible!
One of the only cool things about this game is hogwarts seems to have doubled in size.
Like the first game it is way to easy.
If I were you id wait to buy it untill the price drops.
Prof. Lockhart looks like someone hit him with a can opener.
Dramatically.
Moaning Myrtle and Peeves are annoying.
The best part is throwing gnomes.

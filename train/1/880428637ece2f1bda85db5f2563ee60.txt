It was bad.Honestly, rent Lip Service from the UK or almost anything else.
It just all felt so forced.
I made it as far as the first kiss and stopped it.
Yeegads.
Another horrible endeavor from Nicole Conn.
Mediocre acting at best.
Avoid Nicole Conn films unless you like to cringe.
I just couldn't even go any further.
This is quite possibly THE worst lesbian film I've ever seen...aside from Claire of the Moon, Conn's other film.
Stilted storylines, terrible dialogue.
This movie was so bad I couldn't even get through it.
I cringed the entire time I watched it.
They are SO bloody awful it's beyond words.
How in the world anyone can rate this and it garners 4 and half stars is beyond me.
The kissing was devoid of passion, close lipped.
Honestly, how does she get funding for her films?

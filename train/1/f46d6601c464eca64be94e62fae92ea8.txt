but this is exhausting.
I am unafraid of intellectual, historical novels that are well written .
But the two parallel stories of Marconi's invention and the developing murder -two separate aspects of the novel- have yet to become entwined in any manner.
I have not read Mr. Larsen's first book, which I understand is quite excellent.
As I state in the title here, this very borrring, and the plot has no momentum.
and the other plot (the murder mystery) takes place mostly around 1910.
I have yet to finish the 390 page book (plus appendices and notes), but am now 280 pages into it and the plot has yet to develop.
That reputation is the reason I bought this.
.
.
As a matter of fact the major part of the Marconi story is in the late 1890s into 1903 or 1904 at this point .
A poor effort, and it seems almost formulaic if I undertstand the plot devlopment in his first book correctly.
.
I believe there is a murder, and I believe Marconi's wonderful wireless invention will help with the murder case.

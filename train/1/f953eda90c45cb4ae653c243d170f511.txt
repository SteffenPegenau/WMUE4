God OWES YOU NOTHING!
I do not know of many husbandmen who looked for someone selfish to marry.
Try to write a book now explaining why God really isn't a Genie to pull out when you selfishly want something.
God is made into a NEW image here.
This book isn't going to help any person get into the kingdom of God, it will destroy you!
GOD made us for HIS GLORY not OUR pocketbook.
Look away from yourself and on to the glorious savior and EVERLASTING GOD.
This life is but a breath.
We are here to get ready to Marry our glorious God in Heaven.
GET your oil lamps ready!!!
I would suggest to Wilkinson that all the money that he is making from writing this book should be well spent trying to make amends with THE IMUTABLE GOD in heaven.
Try looking at the second commandment: Though shalt not make a graven image!
WE owe HIM everything!
Do not be fooled.
He bought those who serve him with a price.

And when it does, the ipod won't be under warrenty.
It was great, but then about 2 or 3 months later, it stopped working.
DO NOT BUY THIS.
At first I thought it was the headphones, but after testing my $130 sony's on it, and they didn't work, I knew it was broken.
I sent it back, and I'll give the store credit, I got a new one in a few days.
And by the way, it's not just an unlucky coincidence that both of them broke.
I'll deffintly go for the 20 gig then.
Bottom line, DO NOT BUY THIS.
All I got was static.
Luckily, there are still 19 days in my warrenty, but I'm 100% positive that it will happen again.
I bought this ipod in February of 2004.
Then I'll have to buy a new one, because Apple charges $250 to fix broken ipods not under warrenty.
It works great at first, but it breaks easily.
I've talked to other people who had the same problem.
But guess what, 9 months later, I'm having the same problem.

I don't think so.
Then, I removed the card and reinserted.
I also in this process switched to different brands, they read every time.
I don't know.
All around not what I expected.
It did not recognize the card again.
I tried for several hours before it recognized the card the first time.
NO!
I tried my 3 year old desktop same thing.
They did ship it very quickly...the shipping cost more than the cards.
My 2 year old laptop would not recognize them.
I purchased 2 cards at the same time.
I did not contact the company they would probably have made it right.
I have never had any problems with any other brand of SD cards.
I did try both cards, same problem with both.
After too many times to count and trying numerous things with the desktop it finally recognized one card and I was able to transfer pictures both to and from the card.
They did work in my three cameras and a digital picture frame.
Maybe I received faulty ones?
Just my experience... Would I buy this brand again?

Factory CD audio discs don't load.
Custom burned discs don't load.
It's not worth the hassle (especially if the damn vendor doesn't take SONY a/v returns!
It can't read ANYTHING.
I ordered this particular unit SPECIFICALLY because it advertised the ability to read DVD+/-DL discs.
Factory DVDs don't load.
I have a $200+ piece of junk that will cost me another $10-$30 to ship back to RMA to SONY.
Shipping was in the regular retail box, but I thought it was suspended/packaged respectably from the factory.

Bottom line: major headache.
Ordered from Etronics.
Don't take a chance ordering this online.
Well guess what?
NOTHING loads.
Verdict is still out on them (their policy is not to take opened-item returns of SONY products).

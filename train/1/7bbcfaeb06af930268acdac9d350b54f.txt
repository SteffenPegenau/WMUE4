THIS IS SO FUN FOR 5 YEAR OLDS.
WHAT AM I SAYING.
ALMOST NO GAMES.
WAIT.
PLEASE LET ME REPHRASE.
OK GRAPHICS.
AND CAN PLAY MOVIES, MP3S, DIGITAL PICTURES/SLIDESHOWS, AND GAMES OF COURSE.
CRAPPY GAMES.
THE PSP WILL DEFINETLY CRUSH THIS AND THE DS WILL DIE AND EVERYONE WILL FORGET ABOUT IT.
THIS IS SO FUN.
SHAME ON YOU NINTENDO!!
I GOT IT FOR CHRISTMAAS AND RARELY PLAY IT ANYMORE.
THE GRAPHICS AREN'T AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED.
LIKE THE N64.
THE PSP HAS PS2 GRAPHICS.

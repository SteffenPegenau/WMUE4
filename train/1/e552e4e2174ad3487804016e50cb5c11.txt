I think we're onto something.
I was really hoping it would help her with her separation anxiety.
I hope.
I tried the thundershirt - did not work.
I have also been working to desensitize her - picking up car keys, putting shoes on, doing things to act as if I'm leaving - but then, I sit down or do some chores - I don't leave.
Two days ago I began to take her cycling - she trots alongside me.
Tried rescue remedy - did not work.
This seems to be tiring her out a little bit - in turn, taking some of the edge off.
This may work for some dogs, but not mine.
Tried calming treats, stuffed frozen kongs, and more - nothing worked.
But, she got worse.
I have since removed the collar and over the course of a few days she has gone back to her "normal" anxiety level.
She started to have excessive drooling, swollen tongue, bloodshot eyes, elevated body heat - every time I left.
We're still working on it.
Now she can't tell if I'm going to do the dishes or walk out the door.

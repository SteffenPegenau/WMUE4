On the other hand, importing from DB5 required that I use V5 then V7.
It is slow, remains sloppy to use, and the customizing screens tend to slip away before you are done making the feeble changes that are allowed.
That is as far as I have had time to push to now.
Sigh!
I recommend you pass on this ?upgrade?
Another reviewer speaks of taking a minute & a half to load on an old machine.
My 2+Gig with 500Mb RAM is also sloooow to load.
It is pretty good software for 1989.
Trouble is, this isn't 1989.
Hope not too many more traps await me.
Especially hope the crashings do not come.Absent a major change of heart by management, I cannot imagine ever buying another edition of ACT!
I was upgrading (?)
Some of the features that didn't work at all in V5 now work, but not properly (such as field names and sub-groups).
V7 simply refused to import the data.
from v5, which is no great shakes, either, but I stuck with it because the Goldmine reviews were underwhelming.

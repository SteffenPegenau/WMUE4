If anyone disagrees, I would welcome a reply.
But it's not Mozart.
It's not even seriousness musicianship.
There is no single correct way to play Mozart.
(Witness Casadesus, Klien, Brendel, Barenboim, Schnabel, Uchida, Schiff, Richter, Kraus, Perlemuter, and others.)
But then why record them and later write an essay explaining why he doesn't like them?
What we have here is a supremely talented but off-puttingly arrogant show-off making fun of a revered composer and admiring himself for doing so.
Actually, who (except Gould himself) really cares whether he liked Mozart?
Yes, Gould can play the piano.
But Gould's travesty is not one of them.
His is without a doubt the worst recording of Mozart's piano sonatas that I ever heard.
OK, fair enough.
His digital dexterity is nothing short of amazing.
By his own admission, Glenn Gould didn't like Mozart's music and he especially didn't like his piano sonatas.
All sorts of interpretive possibilites are open to a pianist.

Is it that good?
This product has super ratings.
I can only say that I lasted longer on a vitamin tablet than this.
I to not believe them.
But even if it is on sale at 50 percent off I would not recommend this.
Well, Eating real food is the only safe bet.
Is it better or worse?
It is not the same as eating real food.
I am not sure how safe this is but it is different than a vitamin tablet.
Is this better than a vitamin tablet.
It sounds like it has natural ingredients.
As for other reviewer that claim they have taken this for years and love it.
Is there more risk of spoiling?
I am not sure how safe many vitamin tablets are.
It seems to good to be true.
It is expensive also.

I had to end up spending $250 for the Medela Pump in Style pump.
I paid $50 for this worthless piece of junk.
Also the description said it was a quiet pump.
It was so loud (sounded like a lawn-mower) that i would have to pump in another room.
They should discontinue this product.
I have a baby car seat manufactured by them and it was not easy to use at all.
The only good products that they do sell are the baby bottles.
I should have listened to the comments before purchasing this junk.
It only lasted a week.
As all you mothers that pump would know, it sucks to interupt the pump when your milk is flowing smoothly.
I would recommend every one to not purchase any Evenflo products.
NOT!
The valve on the second pump (the one that is not attached to the motor) would get stuck after a minute and i would have to stop pumping and dry it out.
It is soo much better than this pump.
I should have bought that from the start.

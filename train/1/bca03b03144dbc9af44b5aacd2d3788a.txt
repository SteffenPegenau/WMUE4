If one of your key is broken, sorry!
BUT!
Only problems with manufacturing are covered.
No repair.I do not think this is reasonable for a $355 device.
Wonder full the reading and fulfillment process.
Stupid of me.
Couldn't be better.BUT!
I buy EVERYTHING from them.
I am totally addicted.
The Kindle Screen is broken.Of course I should receive no warranty!
Paid Repair should be an option.SHAPE UP AMAZON!
THE SERVICE & SUPPORT ARE HORRIBLE.My 2.5 yr son dropped the kindle in the airport.
We do not repair.Come on!
I love amazon since 1996.
I love their first concept kindle design but THIS NON-SERVICE IS UNACCEPTABLE!If your kindle has a problem with the power supply plug they cannot repair it.
Length:: 1:42 MinsI Love the Kindle.
Amazon.com does NOT REPAIR BROKEN KINDLE'S at all.Support they told me: BUY A NEW KINDLE.ARGUMENT: Did you not read the warranty info?

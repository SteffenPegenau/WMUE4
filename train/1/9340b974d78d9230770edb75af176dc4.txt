The Video isn't incredible, either.
Yep.
Well, I just bought myself Transformers on DVD.
Augh!
Could it get any worse?
Hissy and muted.
I'm not sure if I got a different version.
Pan and Scan only ?!?!!
I was incredibly dissapointed.
Disgusted, even.
on Par with the VHS copy.
It has a different cover than what's shown here on Amazon (I bought mine at a local video store) This version is released by a company called Seville and Sports a cover like the VHS Release froma few years back with Optimus.
Perhaps slightly crisper.
No extras whatsoever.
Not even a theatrical trailer.
Needless to say.
Giggling like an idiot and running to my DVD player I was absolutley shocked when I threw it in.
The sound is horrible.

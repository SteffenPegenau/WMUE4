It is the biggest disappointment.
Well, when you cook meat products it does not taste like how it should taste when you would cook it on an outdoor grill.
I used to live with my parents and they have the best indoor grill so I figured I want one for myself since I love to grill.
It is not at all a grilled taste.2.
Why is this bad?
It is a waste of time and money.
The product does not live up to its reviews.
Not only that it doesn't heat up high enough to cook a thin slice of steak.
Here are reasons to not buy this product.1.
After reading such great reviews I thought it'd be a good investment.
Just don't get it.
It is like the George Foreman grill.
I purchased three of this, one for myself, and two as gifts.
You would probably spend more than 4 hours for one piece of thinly cut steak.3.
I mean S-L-O-W!
Wrong.
It heats up really slow.

How do you make a greatest hits album WITHOUT ONE HIT?!?!?
He has the nerve to drop a greatest hits album.
CamRon is the best no talent rapper to ever and I mean ever breathe into a microphone.
That is NOT gangsta.
Heeeeee Rapppppppssss Sooooooooo Slooooooowwwwww!
Somebody please enlighten me.
He has no flow whatsoever and does not rhyme a word he says and when he does rhyme it is completely wack.
His voice is even more banal and monotone than Fabolous when he first dropped ( he's improved drastically).
I can't even be bothered to review the rest of this wackness.
Zero stars.
Harlem should be ashamed...and what is his fascination with the color pink!?!?
I just feel different when I listen to wack music.
It's just boring music that is used only for torture.
I'm with reviewer Mistermaxx in that CamRon has no vibe, no funkiness.
The beats on this album are above decent but CamRon ruins it.
I don't like the feeling.

i mean that's just what this world needs.
WOW!
I mean what is the point.
period.
And have you heard the dance remakes.
You're doing yourself and those around you a huge favor.
can do much better singing their own songs, but I don't knoow of many people on this planet that can sing worse than anyone on this c.d.
This is horrible.
A bunch of 9 years olds out boogying to this.
Just let the artists sing their own songs.
it's not even any different lyrics than the origional songs.
It just doesn't make sense.
We'll have to make some under 12 clubs for this one...But anyway.
Not that most of the artist on this c.d.
Just don't buy the c.d.
So PLEASE.

Being a baby boomer this is not an unfamiliar story line.
Nothing happens.
Too bad.
Other than that it was not a bad read.
The torture chamber operators?
Couldn't they have had some interaction with any number of persons they came across.
At every opportunity nothing happens.
We've been exposed to any number of end of the world type tales, books, movies etc.
Not a lot going on with the 'lost generation' either.
Bleak will be well described for you from every angle.
I gave it three stars for it's potential as a short story.
The espied little boy?
I would love to tell you what a great literary achivement The Road is, and it may well be, but to me it was little more than uneventful.
But doggone it when the occasion arrises for some plot to develop it doesn't.
Some of my fellow amateur critics have suggested Mccarthy's works to be Hemmingwayesque.
Perhaps.
Not the 'one star' that the scale shows.
I was looking forward to a fresh perspective and that just didn't surface.

The juicer is unsafe and has on atleast 6 different times vibrated so hard the lid actually came loose and the whole juicer vibrated all over the counter top.
I have contacted the closest service center and I'm waiting to hear from them.
!
My other concern is that I didn't receive any warrantee information with the juicer.
The first was purchased in 1975-76.
When I wanted to buy a juicer I went to Acme expecting the same quaility as my original juicer.
When my son went off to college he took the juicer with him and still uses it regularly.
BEWARE!!!
The first time I used it the plunger top came loose from the stem and continues to do so during juicing.
I hope I can get my money back!!
This is my second Acme juicer.
I purchased my Acme Juicer 6001 about a month ago.
I purchased it as "new" for $198.00.
Has anyone else experienced the same?
Juice flying every where!

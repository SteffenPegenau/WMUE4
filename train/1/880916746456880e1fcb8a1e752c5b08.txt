* Point is : this cd will not fit in your tape deck, but then again, u prolly won't want it to because it's so bad *if u are into bands like Sum 41, the Backstreet Boys, or Disturbed, chances are you MIGHT like this.
!cya guyz l8er!
Another bad thing about this cd is that it only has 8 songs, 4 of which are nothing but silence.
man, what a crappy tape.
Hey, i bet I can sing better, right??
i dunno why it sounds so bad.
i dunno, i don't like reggae too much, so maybe you won't like this.
Whats with that?
BUT, you also may NOT.
Geez dood.
lemme tell u, this is crap.
For one, there'e too many love songs on here.. wha wha, who wants to hear u cry about your car crashing??
i listen to a lot of punk, like Blink 182 and stuff, and someone told me about the Misfits, so i bought static age and a shirt of them.
I don't think the lady can sing very well on this album.
u gotta but this album!
it's like a mix of reggae-pop and heavy metal.

This game relies on time.
Almost 0 progress is made after the beginning.
Think a huge castle might be fun to explore?
You (mouse) is stuck in a constant time loop.
The graphics are horrible.
If you don't like it, try FFX... that's a good game.
there are annoying monsters readly to ambush about every 15 seconds.
It has one of the best scores i've ever heard on a game.
Up there with the final fantasys'.
Rent this before you buy it if you have any intrest at all.
I think my gameboy had better graphics.. seriously.
THIS IS THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.
The one major plus of this game is the music.
Most of the game is running around though the town.
Everytime I try to play this is feel my blood pressure going up because THERE IS NOTHING TO DO!
wrong!
That's another thing.

I am still looking for a replacement (or original) WaveRest.
Too lame.
The way to identify an original is that it will have "Beklin" in which at the top with a white oval around it... just like the product image above; however, that is NOT what you receive.
Not as soft and gel like.
The pad?
I can feel it under the pad.
This LOOKS like the original Belkin WaveRest (which cost $8).
I'm using it right now.
You receive a cheaper, inferior version sans oval.Sorry, my friends.
Out there somewhere there is one for sale, and I'm going to buy it.
I'll let you all know if I find it.
Why is that there?
The material is different.
It's annoying.I still have an original WaveRest from a decade ago.
Looks only.
Not as fine or nice.
And what's with the bar under the pad?

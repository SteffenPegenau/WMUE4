A waste of a great title.
At least you'll be able to read it.
That's not rich.
The author is poverty stricken in relationship to literature.
Read that book, if you are so inclined.
His ideas are unoriginal, based on "Think and Grow Rich."
He owns a tile and flooring company.
This is truly one of the worst books I've ever read.
He teaches finances at his local church.
The desktop publishing looks like a ransome note and gives me a headache.
He's not intelligent but he is judgemental.
I guess that could make him a miliionare.
Great title, terrible book.
It appears to be self published.
That's not an expert.

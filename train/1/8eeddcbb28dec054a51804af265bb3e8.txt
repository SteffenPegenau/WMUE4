K.T.?
Natalie?
I guess enjou kosai is too deep a subject for American audiences.
My advice?
Don't buy the TOKYOPOP release.
But the english audio has these "tricked out" rice rockets in an attempt to be "cooler' and "more hip" to the same people who think "The Fast and the Furious" is real.
and her "daddy" has been deeply removed.
Who came up with these names?
Save your money for the R2's.
It's mangled, just like the manga (US release).
Iggy?
The background music as well was mangled, as they replaced the original tracks with - face it - horrible garage and punk bands.
The major KICK-IN-THE-PANTS is that the relationship between Natsumi (errr, Natalie?)
Also, the original creators actually sampled the authentic engine sounds for each of the different cars for the original version.
In the English version on the disc, they really bent over for American Censorship (TM).

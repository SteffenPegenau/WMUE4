Long, long shots that should have been edited down.
The story was, well I guess, a myth India is familiar with and make many assumptions for the viewer.
The directing and editing was horrendous.
Very little dialogue (and in hindsight, that's a good thing).
The lead actress, Mallika Sherawat, was absolutely stunning.
I am absolutely blown away, this had a bollywood dance scene thrown in.
I have no ****ing idea.
I know India's bollywood produce way more pictures than American studio's, but 1) they do not know how to produce a good movie or 2) their tastes are very far removed than other cultures.The CGI was OK. Sci-Fi channel OK.
The dollar was good to watch the sexy snakewoman - Mallika
Many times I had no idea what was going on or why.
Good gawd this was bad.
Bad actress, but amazingly beautiful.The other actors were OK, but still pretty flat.
Just a filler and weird.
Why?
In a MST3K kind of way.

I feel like my music is being listened to through a drain pipe.
I bought these at Walgreens for the list price.
has made it any better.So to sum it up: Don't buy these EVER and I really really want my money back.
Nothing I've tried (turning headphones volume up and iPod volume down, etc.)
These are the worst headphones I've ever had.
Already broken and unreturnable.Now onto the sound quality.
I am by no means an audiophile, but I can hear crap.
These are soooo tinny.
I wouldn't even pay what Amazon is selling them for.
I've had a bad run with headphones lately, so I thought I'd spend a little extra on something for my iPod and hopefully have something with better quality and great sound.
But that's it.
Parts of songs are completely lost.
They're shoddy.
I wouldn't even take these if they were giving them away for free.
First day of wear, within first five minutes, the volume control slide fell off.
I got neither.I can say that they're the most comfortable buds I've ever had.

replace it.
buy a porter cable.
I've owned Three I know.
next one dies 2 days later.
still under warranty.
or you like needless trips to the store.
Three days and then sat for a few months.
don't buy unless you will only sand with it maybe 30 hours of your life.
this sander is the cloud on my sunny day.
the second finished the job.
will not last for more than a week of heavy use.
the first one died in an hour.
dead.
cool look.
first week it came out.

Really, there is no point to this novel.
Never before has hype proven so unjustified.
This book is terribly disappointing.
And ridiculously dull "bad guys" chase ridiculously dull "good guys".
Such an awful execution.
Undeveloped characters travel from place to place.
Blah.
Blah.
And it makes me angry that the publishing industry is making it a bestseller by manipulating readers (like me) who really would like an intelligent and gripping novel.
Please, do yourself a favor and think twice before you purchase this disaster.
Blah.
Such a wonderful premise.
Uninteresting characters eat and eat.
Nothing happens.
I wish I could hold someone accountable for the money I spent on an absolutely awful novel.

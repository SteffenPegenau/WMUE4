I wonder where he picked that up?
Are you still there?".
I borrowed a friend's 2.4 GHz phone and had no problems.
Hello?
Sometimes you couldn't understand a word of their message.
This phone cuts out and clicks -- once every few minutes.
Back to the AT&T 2256, and every call was the same mess.
Also poor quality on the answering machine.
Right now my parrot is screaming "Sorry!
I finally gave the phone to my parrot to have fun picking off the buttons.
It's my phone!"
My troubleshooting indicated that it was this phone model, not my phone line or any sort of interference.
Every conversation: the other person would be in the middle of talking, then they'd hear clicking noises and I'd hear them say "Hello?
Once in a while it was just a fool who didn't enunciate... but usually it was clear to be the machine's fault.
I got used to saying "Sorry, it's my phone."

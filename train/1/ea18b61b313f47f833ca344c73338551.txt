I don't even mail CDs in a paper envelope.Overall: Horrible.
0 is around -85 for my unit.
ZERO instructions.Shipping: inside a paper envelope.
Should have hit my local Harbor Freight up instead.
The unit was either banged around too much in delivery or was just totally uncalibrated from the factory.
It is very easy to pry off a wall, engine, fender, etc.
Try ~2 pounds.
HAHAHA!
It cannot hold up the weight of the unit.
176 pounds of holding force?
Barely useable.
Dial indicator: It works, but that's the only kind words I can say about it.
Fortunately, the scale can rotate to allow for this.22 piece tips: They fit.
It's not like it's a hard tool to setup and use, but still.
They seem sub-Harbor Freight quality, but they fit.The magnetic stand: Total garbage.
It is laughably awful.Instructions: Totally absent.
The adjustable arm is awful.
The shabbiness of this stand is the whole reason I'm taking the time to write this review.

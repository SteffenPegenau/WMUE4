I didn't get bored with the movie, but I was excited watching it either.
The only thing I enjoyed about this movie was Elijah Woods.
And bewarned, this movie has a lot of sexuality in it.
I would suggest renting this movie before you buy it.
That alone will keep me from ever watching this movie again..
All the people I've talked to did not like the movie, but there are a lot of reviews on this site that do like the movie.
Except Pulp blows this movie out of the water.
But thats it.
Its almost like a weird bad version of Pulp Fiction.
This movie was a big disappointment for me.
It had a touch of Quentin to the movie, but not near as good as Quentin does it.
It kind of just dragged on.
Never been a big fan of his except Desperado.
If you don't like a lot of senseless nudity, you won't like this flick.
I'll stick with Quentin as opposed to Robert.
I guess its just a acquired taste.
His part was super groovy.

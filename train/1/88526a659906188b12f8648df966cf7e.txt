In art circles there are certain names which it is taboo to speak critically about.
It is no Grand work.
Likely the greatest work on anything !!!"
That is that!
I was told as a young artist that this was THE book which would show me the way.
These seem just some of his notes on the subject anyway.
It is no more than an intro, and at that a VERY POOR one!
I did find the way, my way anyway, but this book had nothing to do with it.
One star.
I have had this book for forty years now.
What abject nonsense.
I am forty years along now, and I just do not get why this is a good book for anyone's purpose regarding artistic anatomy.
I cannot tell you how many times I have been told "this is the greatest work on anatomy bar none!
Still and all - maybe it's just me.
I don't get it.
It has nothing to do with Brigman's talent or his ingenuity.
Do not attempt to give this book less than five stars if you are within 50 blocks of the Art Student's League.

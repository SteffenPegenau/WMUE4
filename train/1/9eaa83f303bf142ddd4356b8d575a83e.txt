listen to the original recording.
if randy rhoades was still alive, who knows, ozzy could have been on the outs with him too and had zakk wylde mess up all his guitar tracks too.
this isnt 1984 (the book) you arent aloud to go back and erase history and pretend like something never happened.
ozzy is a joke now.
i just saw him live and he was playing to a backing track.
i dont mean just singing- zakk wylde wasnt playing either.
that is not a joke, they werent playing.
dont buy this album!
jesus.
its a piece of crap and a slap in the face to the original musicians.
that is so low its beyond words.
seriously, why not re-record the guitars too so randy's family cant get any more money either?
is anyone else shocked by the nerve of ozzy and sharon for recording over the bass and drums so the original guys wouldnt get any more money in royalties?
what a nightmare.
screw this thing.
i just keep losing more respect for ozzy.

Not to mention the hours of extra work on my part to keep my pet clean and comfy.
Please be careful to examine your products when they arrive.
I wore out a vacuum.
This took a tole on me and my pet.
And tried many products.
My dog is 8 years old and never had a flea with Frontline plus.
I use gift cards to buy my pet products.
Of course, enough time had passed I didn't remember exactly where I bought it.
I will never forget that someone harmed my pet and took my money.
Then suddenly my dog gets fleas.
Finally I found a replacement.
He don't work and lives on freebies.
You will so regret buying a fake or expired product.
I buy enough to last for months.
You should enjoy the spring and summer months with your pet.
Frontline plus is not cheap.

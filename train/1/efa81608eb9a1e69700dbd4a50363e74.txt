You can buy only a few knives for the price of this set.
They are made in China by the Hoan Corporation.
What does this mean?
So, how are the knives.
These were admittedly a great deal.
But the moment you get them you understand why.
The block is a piece of pine crap that'll likely split in a few weeks on the countertop.
Mine are going back post haste with an angry note about being lied to and deceived by Amazon.
They are what you would expect.
They are full tang and a bit heavy with plastic handles.
First and foremost is the monster lie being propagated here: These are not Farberware knives N-O-T.
I wrote Farberware about this.
It means that Amazon is putting that Farberware label on them to move the product.
The knives do not indicate on them or anywhere on any packing that they are Farberware.
I find that so offensive it's enough to make me want to skip Amazon as a source for online products.
The key to any purchase is trust and they've lost mine.

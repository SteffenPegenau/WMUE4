Reload...
Kicked it around for 4 or 5 months wondering when I would locate suitable batteries without wasting a trip to the store... Found bats, have lantern -load batteries (accordingly) and Wa-laa...
It's cheap because it is.
Buy the better cheaper but not this one because it is worthless.
This was to go with the tent she bought for her New Zealand relatives to camp out in the grand canyon.
I dug it out, a few years later... No batteries, which is good when stored.
If I could give it no stars I would.
Lesson learned?
Worthless junk, tossed it in garbage.
NOTHING!!!
If I questioned why I'd take this time to review, I wouldn't.
It's obviously a bad product not worth mention to begin with.
My wife always buys high tech looking bad equipment.
Use once and toss...
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Help wife who goes camping before I going sailing.

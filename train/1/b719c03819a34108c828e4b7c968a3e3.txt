I am so disappointed.
The writing style is radically diff.
I feel like yawning.
The writing is so juvenile, and Alexandra is possibly the most annoying heroine ever.
Sorry fans.
I find it hard to belive that Joan Wolf wrote this.
I adore Joan Wolf books and have been eagerly awaiting this one for months.
All she does is complain, and speak "coldly" to people.
This novel is not original.
What I loved about Joan Wolf's previous novels was her ability to develop relationships between both characters.
For all of you who loved The Gamble, Pretenders etc, do not buy this one.
The storyline and encounters between Niall and Alexndra are boring.
I don't feel the sparks between them.
from the previous books and very much like the generic romance drivel you find elsewhere.
This one doesn't cut it.
However, I find myself struggling to finish each page.

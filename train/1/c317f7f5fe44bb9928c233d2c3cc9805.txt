In short, I hate this movie.
Why, it's so shockingly bad, that there should be an 11th Commandment against it.
I am now convinced that David Hayes is the Anti-Christ.
The whole thing looks so shaky that you cannot tell what's going on.
Please don't!
DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.
To this day I lie awake in bed, wondering if anyone, besides the actors, enjoy it.
I cried that day, because I couldn't believe I actually bought this "movie".
"Thou shalt not watch Back Woods".
The acting is so incomprehendedly vile, I just can't describe it.
People, I beg of you.
It's so DUMB!!!!!
Even if you're curious, don't buy it.
None of the deaths are good.
The sound is horrible.
Actually, everyone who is involved with this movie are Anti-Christs.
It is shot with A HOME VIDEO CAMERA....you heard me.
Peace out.
I was curious, and I paid severely.
The music is horrible.

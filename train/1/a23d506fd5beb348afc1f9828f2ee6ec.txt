overrated.
no features at all.
.
.
james cameron is stretching avatar as far as it will go.
the 1 star above is both for the film itself and the product.
also, teach distributors that they cant take advantage of the public by refusing to buy the next additions of avatar that come out.i wish u could put 0 or negative stars
a new release is comin out soon with features.
also, in 2011 a special edition thing is comin out with more features.
acting is great, special effects are great, story is mediocre, but, it is the overratedness that should turn everyone away from this product.
DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!
.
plus it is an all together bad (okay not bad) film that was extremely overrated.
.
overrated.

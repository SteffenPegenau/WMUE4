Great.
Came in broken.
Called number on box that said to call if item is damaged.
As for Amazon, it was shocking how little they cared.
Guess i will start buying retail in stores.
Some call center for Poulan.
All they would do is tell me to take it to a repair center.
They couldnt care less my item was broken.
Only 30 day window from purchase to return.
Great.
Poulan is now on my dont buy list.
Wow, lot of help.
It never got used a single minute.
2 of those weeks were delivery time.
Well, 6 weeks later my weed eater is still sitting at the repair center.
My reply, uhhh because on the box in bold letters it says to call a specific number if product is damaged, which i did.So, i am out $$$ and have no product either.
I call and they have no clue when they will get to it.I called Poulan back and they said too bad.
I called Amazon and they didnt care either.
The idiot i talked to asked, why didnt you call us first when it came in broken?

To make it worse is one of the episodes skipped is the next to last episode.I would advise against getting the first season Sailor Moon DVD set.

The Sailor Scouts themselves would keel over if they seen these DVD's of the first season coming out.
Usagi/Serena & Rei face off?
I want a boyfriend too.
By the time all the Sailor Moon season 1 DVD's are released a total of 6 episodes will never be seen.
The cursed bus!
The nightmare of dreamland.12.
You'll be getting the EXACT same thing.
Usagi's/Serena's misfortune!
The brain-washing cram school.9.
Beware of the rushing clock.10.
The fighter of flames, Mars, appears.11.
We should be getting the first of the Sailor Moon season the same way we are getting Sailor Moon S & Sailor Moon Super S. The episodes on the second DVD should be:7.
Tape the show off TV.
The way to stardom is tuff.8.
Trap of the cruise ship.With this DVD's release we are missing 3 episodes.

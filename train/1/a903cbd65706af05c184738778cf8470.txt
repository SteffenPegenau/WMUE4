It almost looks black.
I had to fix that as well.
First thing that I noticed was that the wood stain was much darker than it was in the photos.
I ordered 6 of these chairs.
I weigh 180 lbs and I feel like have to be very careful sitting down in them.
The wood was very soft and fragile.
I'm not talking about 3 problems on one chair.
When putting them together two of the legs broke.
3 of the 6 chairs I bought had defects.
Each front leg is only held together by two bolts into very soft wood.
I ended up wood gluing the legs back together, adding wood shims and extra screws to fix them.
Skip this product unless you want to learn how to fix them.
I seriously doubt they would hold a bigger person.
One chair had the holes drilled in the wrong spot in the back.
I'm not sure what kind of birch they grow in china but I have never seen it so soft.

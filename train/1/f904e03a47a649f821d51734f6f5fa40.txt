"His unforgivable mistakes, especially in casting and then OK'ing the storyline, were what amateur directors do...not a seasoned veteran.I hated it.
And give us a refund.
The Directing (as I mentioned), unbelievably unfathomably...sucked.
The writing was awful.
And...ice cream.It's deplorable.
The acting was soooo bad, it was like watching a traffic accident.
And should apologize for wasting our time.
...after watching 3 seasons of it (like as in EVERY SINGLE EPISODE), then you really don't deserve to call yourself a director.
It sucked.
And while running a fever.
And promise to NEVER touch this storyline again!
You're remorsefully shocked, and want it to go away (or get up and leave, but can't, since your kids were with you).
No wait, my five year old could have.
Go watch the original show.
With his eyes closed.
"Sucked" as in "Oh, my God....I,me, yes me, could have done better!

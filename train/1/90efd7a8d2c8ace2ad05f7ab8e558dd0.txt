I loved Red Dragon.
Both were difficult to put down, once I started to read.
And Clarice -- why, she's just a woman, after all, to be molded by her man into something better.
Hannibal himself suddenly becomes the cannibal with a heart.
Both had me looking over my shoulder, making sure no monsters were sneaking up on me.Hannibal, on the other hand, had me looking at my watch to see if maybe something more interesting was happening somewhere.
Run, Sir Anthony!!!
Well, maybe not.
Who cares?
Or is it worse?
!How sad.
Nay, let not the casting director of "Hannibal" capture you!!
Both had me starting at sounds in the night.
Or is it just silly?I know why I pre-ordered this book; what I don't know is why I finished it....
Both were tight, suspenseful, chilling, thrill rides into the world of sociopathic serial killers.
Run, Jodie!!!
Anywhere!Mason Verger is a caricature of evil.
I loved Silence of the Lambs.
Well, maybe he is.
Well, maybe.... Who knows?

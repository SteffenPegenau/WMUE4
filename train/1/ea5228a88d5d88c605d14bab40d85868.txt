I was so annoyed that I only asked if I mail it to the address on the COBY website.
very dissapointed!
Told me to send the product back to them AT MY COST and they will review and replace it.
It broke, so I tried contacting the customer service.
I have lost money that I paid for it, plus shipping!
)before anyone even answered!!
When I finally got him on the phone again, he said they never received it, that I sent it to the wrong address.
I waited about a month, was on hold again for 20 minutes.
Man that I spoke with was probably the most rude customer service person that I have even meet in my entire life!
I am so frustrated with the whole situation.
It took 6 times (about 20 minutes each time!
Didn't give me a reference number!
He said yes!
I have used this cd player for about 3 weeks for 20 minutes a day (played a cd before my baby went to sleep).
It's not about the $30, but about a company that doesn't stand behind their product!

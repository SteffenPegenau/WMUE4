Westinghouse will ruin their reputation by putting out pour quality items.
But if it was good I liked it the best.
I purchased 10/07/07 and hooked up.
The remote didn't work good-didn't remember favorite or previous channels well.
It got many channels in different formats.
DONT' BUY.
After less than 2 months it went dead no pic no sound.
The back was the best design a column(spine)you could hook things up from both sides without moving the set around.
I got something else.
Westinghouse said to bad-Best Buy said bring it back.
It was beautiful execpt contrast could be better.
I looked at them all.
It had an auto source option detecting what device you wanted to use when turned on.
Took 9 days for tech to come and tell me take it back NO PARTS AVAILABLE.
Got another the remote was worse and DEAD PIXELS on the screen.
The base was the nicest out of all the tvs I looked at.

I am sure this is a fine company.
Yet, 2 days later the beans arrived.
They have a good reputation, to my knowledge.
They just should have honored my request to cancel, this time.
I buy stuff like this on Amazon constantly and love to cook.
Truly, a mutual loss, and too bad...
Just check every detail and order the long way, not 1-click.
I have always wanted to make some homemade Pasta Fagioli.
They are sitting on my counter; leering at me for my idiocy!
As we all do, however, I hit the 1 click button and bypassed the fact that with taxes, fees, shipping...I was ordering $20 for what are, essentially, navy beans.
DIfficult to tell...they are crinkled and settled.
Need I say more?
Anyway, the 1 star is only valid to me, since I IMMEDIATELY sent a request to CANCEL this order.
Yes, it is on me.
It is up to the buyer to be aware of the purchase.
I do wish this company the best.
These bags...are they even fresh?
They would have gotten LOTS of business from me later.

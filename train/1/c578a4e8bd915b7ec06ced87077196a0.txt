Because it is sooo flimsy!!
I bought this for my son who was 4 at the time.
I thought it would be a cool thing for him to see nature and how it works.
We were so dissapointed.
After buying the tank and then having to buy the tadpoles I thought it was wrong to charge us for the tadpoles in the first place!!
The top comes off too easily!!
All in all it was more trouble then it was worth.
They survived two days!!!
That was very fun.
Well, we got the tank and it should be for adults only!
The tadpoles lasted about a month...then I decided back to the river they go beacause it STUNK sooo bad!!
Save your money...Buy a regular aquarium and an adult frog at the pet store.
So we ended up going to the river nearby and catching our own.
Then we waited 4 months for the teadpoles to even come.
It was stinking up the house.

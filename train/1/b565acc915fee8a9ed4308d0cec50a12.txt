So I recommend you still check it out.
It feels a bit like a forced construction.
They are able to do it, but this one missed it.
Parts of it are great, but other parts seem uninspired to me.
But somehow I have the feeling, it would have been better, they worked a year longer on it providing another 70+ min masterpiece with no flaws.
Still strong above average.
Sometimes I even don't trust my own musical taste.
Well, all in all, it is not bad.
Put together in a hurry.
And I sure will give the next Platypus a try.
There are chances, that you like it, because, as I said, it is not bad at all.
This one I like less than "When Pus Comes to Shove".
Well, musical taste may differ.
Some songs sound like Kings X, the rest somewhat mixed bag.
I just missed my personal expectations.
Only 46 min playing time?

this thing doesnt get better!!!
its horrible.
u cant take a pic closer than 5 ft away from object (ex.
I saw it was a 3.2 MP, being a decent picture.
WRONG!!
BAD BUY!!!
(the pic's took ok in the store but only b/c of how bright it is in there)I got it home, and took a few shots, they were no good.
I was sold solely on the compact look,the price and i assumed it has alright quality.
BEWARE
the flash is delayed for 10 sec.
the pictures blurr.
the quality is crappy.
WASTE OF MONEY!!
so i thought id keep it for the weekend and play around with it, thinking i needed to get to know my camera.
I was in Walmart looking for a digital camera, and came across this cute little thing.
fun pics of u and ur friends/family where u hold it out in front on you) the pics will come out white!!!

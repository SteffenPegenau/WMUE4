LCD does not come with a plastic cover.
THIS IS THE WORST CAMERA I'VE EVER SEEN.BAD-1.
I already have 3 or four big scratches, and maybe it's because the LCD monitor didn't come with a thin plastic cover???
I mean that.
I was really disappointed at Sony, for not taking the time to put a dumb cover on it.4.
Camera design is not so comfortable.
I would say that if you are into photography, this is not the camera you want to buy (I know this sounds weird).3.
When you grip the camera, if feels like it might slip out becuase of the unbalanced weight (lens is on one side)2.
IT IS SO EASY TO SCRACH IT.
HARDLY ANY ZOOM.
BUT- this feature is TERRIBLE.OVERALL, THIS IS AN EXTREMELY HAZY AND HAS SOME BAD QUALITY PICTUERS.THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER CHOICES OUT THERE.
They're not the best quality.
This camera also has a feature where you can zoom up to 7x.
Maybe about 2 yards at the most.
Pictures are HAZY.
There's at least 2x.. but it's not going to get you too far.
MAKE A GOOD CHOICE.

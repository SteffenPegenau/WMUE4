I will admit, I have a rabbit, and I do end up vacuuming some hay, too, which does make it a bit more tricky, but I've been doing it for 9 years without clogging issues.
Until now.
There's not much I hate more than having to stick my hand up inside the vacuum and pull the dusty nastiness out by hand.
So, unless all you have to vacuum is dust, this is not the vacuum for you.
Had to go over it multiple times before the vacuum would suck it up.
I should've.
That said, I have just plopped down $130 for a new new vacuum.
The first time I used it, the belt broke.
Against my better judgement, I didn't return it.
And 1 bunny ball?
How fortunate that it came with an extra.
Argh.
The suction is LOUSY.
I bought this vacuum about 3 months ago for what I thought was a great deal - originally $130, on sale and with coupon for $80.
It clogs with pet hair.

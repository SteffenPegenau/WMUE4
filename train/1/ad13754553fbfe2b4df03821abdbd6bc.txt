Take Star Wars, set it in medieval times, replace robots with dragons, and take out any originality.
550 pages of derivativeness, pointless description (especially that of a certain elf's cleavage), and a carbon copy of Star Wars.
We have no idea either.
That's basically the plot.
Machicolated?!
A fifteen year old (who finished it when he was 19) wrote a 550 page book!
It's that bad.
And as for Eldest, take everything I said here and multiply it by 5.
For starters, 80% of the book is description of either the terrain or of hot elves, and yet I have no idea what the main character looks like.
Yup.
I'm not sure whether that was in Eragon, or Eldest, but what the hey?And then the plot.
I read this a few years ago because it was the latest craze.
Not to mention the fact that Paolini obviously wrote it with a thesauras by his side.
Most teenagers aren't exactly great writers, so I felt I had to check this out.The book?
Yaargh.

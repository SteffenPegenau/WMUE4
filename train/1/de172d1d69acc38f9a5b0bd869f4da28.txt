It is a total waste.
Tech support is worse than useless, they don't even respond to email questions.
The same applies to disc copying.
I was able to burn 1 CD.
I've tried different media and Roxio's "smart burn."
It took almost 7 hours and left off the last 2.5 tracks.
Same results.
There is no way to correct them.
I have tried burning at speeds from 40x down to 8x.
This is without a doubt the worst program, in any category, that I have ever used.
Save your money and don't bother with this program.
It frankly does not work let alone work as advertised.
I've trashed at least 2 doz or more perfectly good CDs trying to get this thing to work.
Nothing works.
It consistently stops burning and displays error messages.

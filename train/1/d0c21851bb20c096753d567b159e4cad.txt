They should be ashamed.Save yourself some time and money.
This is the biggest money grab I've seen in a long time.
There's almost no background of John, his associates in later life, his time with Jesus, nothing.
I found it a little long (I mean really, 12 books?
Zip.
Zilch.
It's better than this book can ever hope to be.
Read the Gospel of John (and everything else in it, for that matter).
These two are capitalizing on their fame by scamming fans.
Nada.
C'mon) but it was compelling overall.I looked forward to what LaHaye and Jenkins would do with the Gospels.
Buy a Bible.
NOTHING.
Well....they've done nothing.
All they've done is basically taken dictation from John word for word, with a little tension thrown in.
First, understand that I am a fan of the Left Behind series.

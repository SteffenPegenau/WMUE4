I see from other reviews that the really horrible actor Stewart Townsend is Charlize Theron's boyfriend.
The costumes are fine.
No gorgeous closeups of her gorgeous face and she dies early.
One has to wonder how a film so bad can be made with so many fine things about it.
The story is ok as well.
That he knows how to do.
Come to think of it, I havent seen much by her lately.
And Charlize probably ignored direction because her acting is utterly unaffecting.
He has sex with the Charleezz character often.
The beautiful wonderful Penelope Cruz is underused.
He cannot act and he utterly cannot imagine what it would be like to be the man he plays in this movie.
She won an Academy Award so she got to demand his inclusion probably.
Is this the fault a dumb director/writer, John Dagan?
Its just shown in a way that is as boring as it can be and we probably have Charlizzzzz to thank for that for dragging in her idiot boyfriend and rejecting direction.
The cinamentography is lovely.

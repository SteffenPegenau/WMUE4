Plot moves at times slow, other times slower.
Dialog seems force.
Character development is weak.
Cliches abound.
Writing is mediocre at best.
No such luck.
Save your money reread _The Firm_.
(Sound fimiliar?)
I cannot find any redeeming values to this book.
Sterotypical characters molded to implasible roles.
Give me a break!
Not much here.
Sigh.
Firm's president is oblivious to his actions.
Yet, on the very next page we are reminded of his fiancé last seen only two months ago.
Brightest of the bright higher by the best of the best _firms_.
One example has the protaginist kissing a women lamenting how long it has been since he has felt the touch of a women.
Powerful woman is made his lover.
I finished the drival hoping against hope for a smashing ending.
US government needs his help.

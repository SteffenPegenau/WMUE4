Everything that was described by A. Ferguson is happening to us.
We were wrong.
This is my 2nd Brita pitcher that we own.
The lid always come off when we try to pour water.
would do.
Totally annoying and irrelevant.
I do not recommend this particular product to anyone.
I agree 100% with a fellow reviewer named A. Ferguson.

It is horrible.
We love the taste of Brita filtered water but will not buy another Brita product until they can resolve the design flaw.
I sent an email to Brita's customer service about our experience but the reply did not answer our question and concern.
We never attempt to pour it when the water is in the reservoir but it still comes off.
We loved the 1st one so much.
When we came across a newer model in 2007, we bought one from Costco.

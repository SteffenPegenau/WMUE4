I guess if you don't mind repurchasing everything each year, this product is for you.
The warmth reminds me of a glowing fireplace.
It rotates side to side and makes not a sound from the rotation (you can turn the rotation off).
I turned this thing on and it immediately glowed orange and started putting out heat.
FINALLY!
Works on a timer up to 90 minutes so I don't have to worry about forgetting to turn it off.
It makes a very quiet humm.
It has a low energy draw.
I will purchase nothing with that brand name.
I won't!
Something that works as it should.
I guess those engineers that design this crap to quit just after the warranty really earned their money on this item.
Apparently they think that I will go out and purchase the same item again.
Worked great until it died.
Get one!Addendum: It crapped out one day after warranty expired.
I am going to order another one!

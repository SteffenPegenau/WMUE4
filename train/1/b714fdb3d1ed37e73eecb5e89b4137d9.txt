Eminem sucks as a producer.
I mean let's be, The only joints that REAL heads will even consider bangin on a Eminem album are the few produced by Dre.
Just listen to any of Pac's joints before he passed and I dare any REAL Pac fan to say he's fall off like this.
Pac would never flow with Obie Trice or Eminem for that matter!
MAN I'm disgusted with this album.
Saying that you like this album is like being poor or even working middle class and voting for George Bush.
Eminem has to be the worst hiphop producer around!
As a REAL Pac fan, I know he would never put his voice to these whack beats!
I don't even think Pac would've even worked with Eminem in the first place.
This album sounds like an Eminem soundtrack with Pac's voice on it.
I'm definetly giving this cd away!
You'd have to be a moron!!!
After I wrote this review I read some of the other reviews and was totally disgusted that anyone could like this crap!
This cd is a disgrace to Pac legacy.

They did not even touch the head.
This did not work either.
I called Humminbird and they sent me a new transducer.
I got it 8 days later (12 total days out of service).
So, in the middle of the 2 week fishing season that I look forward to all year, I sent the whole unit back to them priority mail and they got it in 36 hours.
The screen was blank, but would give me a digital depth reading.
On top of that, they included a USED transducer with it.
They took 2 days to work on it and then shipped it back FedEX.....
So, my review would be simple.
It would not graph a thing.
It still had all the old settings, the right cursor still did not work and there were little flecks of salt by the connector that were there when I sent it in.
In the meantime my right cursor stopped working.
I opened up the box and tested it.
This unit did not work correctly out of the box.
This unit does not work and their service department is not capable of fixing it.

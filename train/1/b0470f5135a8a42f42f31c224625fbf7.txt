The worst software and support I have ever seen.
HP does it again.
It's not worth the phone time or emails.
After 3 years of this pain it finally got to the point were nothing would work.
This POS is on the porch with a hammer in it and I am fishing my old reliable 6200c out of the attic.
It is vulnerable to unstable updates, both HP and Microsoft.
Their script monkeys can barely read, let alone help.
This scanner is as stable as Charlie Manson on crack.
Good hardware.
Device manager would find it but that was it.Support is useless.
Proprietary chip and HP NDA will never allow for linux driver development.
So much for HP lies about Linux support
I would have to use the windows scanning software or my OCR just to scan.
It would work one day, then not even found by it's own software a week later.
(Ubuntu 6.10 thru 10.4) forget this beast.
Oh, for you Linux fans out there.

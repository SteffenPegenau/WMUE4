It wobbles but probably just needs to be balanced (I hope).
I can't use it as a light.
It works fine so I bought two more.
Terrible experience.
I wasn't quite so lucky but just had some minor cuts.
I can't return it.
My 4 year old son was in the room but fortunately was not hit by the glass.
I'm out $300.
The second one works okay.
I bought one of these fans and installed it.
Now the fan motor hums loudly when I turn it on.
When it exploded it shattered the light dome.
I can't use it as a fan.
I contacted minka air via e-mail 3 times and never heard back.
The third fan was a disaster.
The light bulb exploded a few hours after turning it on.

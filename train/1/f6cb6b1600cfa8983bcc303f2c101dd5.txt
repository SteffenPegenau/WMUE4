i'm sure that dream street will be gone b4 u know it!
they actually try to be bsb or nsync?
b/c they r not worth it!
the album stinks and they r just...wat can i say?
i'm tellin u, it's not worth it.
tell ur dream street boys to wait another 10 years!then maybe there'll be a little possibility to succeed!
but as u know, bsb is the best of pop!
),nsync,good charlotte, linkin park, evanescence etc.
some gurls even say that they'll be the next bsb...pul-leese!
c'mon give me a break!
ugly!
now lets take another look.
I don't even know their names that clearly, no need to remember it!
okay now, who the hell do they think they r huh?
dream street r only for gurls under 13. well, I'm 13, and I'm a pop fan, but I hate dreamstreet!please, gurls, do urself a favor, go listen to some better bands such as bsb(my fave ever!
I don't care about nstinc.

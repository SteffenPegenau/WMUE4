I don't suggest Pentax to anybody anymore.
But...Then one day it said memory card error.
Even with its original bag.
I've bought Optios S from amazon 1,5 year ago.
I thought it was a problem of the memory card.
It came with a malfunctioning LCD.
But this happened with 3 other memory cards too.
Fine picture quality for a 3mp camera.
I'm using my camera very rarely and keeping it in a good condition.
Very light.
I've lost all my pictures in it and I was left with a broken memory card.
Easy to use, easy to transfer.
I don't think anything would change if it wasn't over.Now it started to have focusing problems.
My one year was over.
of Pentax I don't think that they would accept such a thing.The new camera was good for a while.
Thankfully amazon sent me another one because as I saw the service (!!??)

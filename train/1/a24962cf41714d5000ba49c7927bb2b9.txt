this box is the WORST!!
!
long story short i now have 3 remotes that do not control my dvr.
after 2 weeks, it doesn't respond to the remote.
first, the dvr would randomly shut off and reset.
called up direct tv, they sent me a replacement remote.
this is the worst box i have ever had and believe me with that huge cable box i didn't think it could get worse.
i have been forced to get up and channel the box myself.
i loved my tivo and thought this would be a wonderful addition to my peaceful tivo obsessed coach potato existence.
direct tv sent someone out.
the remote never works.
they gave me a new box.
boy was i wrong.
no luck!
that is until this awful dvr.

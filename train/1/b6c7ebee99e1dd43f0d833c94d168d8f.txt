I wondered if that was normal.
No lights, no nothing.
But, I did notice right away a nasty vibration.
I'll try a different brand this time.
As people have noted, it is ridiculously easy to set up.
I thought this would be the perfect storage solution for my photo, video and audio files.
Decided to live with it a few days before transferring files.
Dead player.
It had my whole desk throbbing.
The thing just croaked!
So glad I hadn't moved my files!
I purchased it elsewhere and will be returning it pronto.
I'd give it no stars, but that wasn't a choice.
I just purchased one of these because I'm counting down the space on my computer, especially now that I'm doing home movie editing on it.
I'll not be buying another.
Good Thing!
Mmmm.
Too bad, I was so excited.
Good thing - The morning of the third day, no power.
However, I was a little leery.

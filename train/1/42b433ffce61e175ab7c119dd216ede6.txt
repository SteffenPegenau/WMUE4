They can't figure out who took the dog.
The dog comes back.
They lose the dog.
!
Whoop-dee-doo.
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!!
They are sad.
End.
EVER!!
It is about two unintelligent little kids who get a dog.
Uhhh, puh-lease.
Ya see?
I had to read this book for school.
Okay, maybe a little kid who was like, 3 would like it, but older kids will find themselves snoring away.
I could have written this book better.

I'm mad at the director for even MAKING this piece of garbage!!
What the hell was up with all the loads of comedy?!
When I heard all the ravings on this movie ('this is the one we've all been waiting for'!, etc.)
At least they told you where THAT disease came from!So please, I urge you strongly: PASS THIS ONE BY.
SO STUPID!!
I just had to see it, well, being a big fan of horror movies and everything.
No, wait.
I was so mad at this piece of garbage!
Man, "Dreamcatcher" was better than "Cabin Fever" and I hated that one!
And above all: WHERE IN THE HELL DID THE DISEASE COME FROM??!!
And the end?
I've never seen such a big plothole!
What was up with that?
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME unless you feel you need to add "Cabin Fever" to your "Movies I've Seen" list.If you want to see a 'classic-type' horror picture, watch "Wrong Turn", "Resident Evil" or "Ginger Snaps."
And the Bowling Alley Massacre?

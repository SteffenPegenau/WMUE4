Product comes with a 9-volt battery included.
Battery reportedly saves not only time/date but also all recorded messages.

Had to deal without use of those features.
The manufacturer just did not design enough room for the battery and connecting wire.
General Product is compact, sleek, and attractive.
It was easy to set up, has remote control features, and was operational within 10 minutes.

Bad points: 1.
To install the battery, need a phillips screwdriver.
Product that I received had a manufacturing defect -- the "next message" button did not work.
A "no tools needed" approach would have been better.
Had a hard time installing the battery -- battery cover would not close unless extra force was applied.
Has every feature one could want.
This button is also used to set the date and time, as well as the PIN code for remote operation.
Good points: 1.

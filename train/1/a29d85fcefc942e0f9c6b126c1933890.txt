We actually watched the whole thing because it was so funny (not on purpose, mind you).
Have you ever seen a little kid with a stuffed animal held to their throat pretending to be attacked?
The filming was completely cheesy.
when it first came out.
We first watched this movie (by mistake!)
But once we got started, we just had to see what happened next.
I did just buy this ridiculous movie, cause we've been wanting to laugh again.
The slow-mo in the last scenes had us laughing so hard we cried.
That's a negative one star, folks.
But I don't seriously know if I can sit all the way through it.
The "wolf" attacking the bad guys was particularly memorable (not!).
How does that work?
And the narrator.... he's in the movie, then dies... but keeps narrating.
Good luck to the unsuspecting!
Yea, well that's it.

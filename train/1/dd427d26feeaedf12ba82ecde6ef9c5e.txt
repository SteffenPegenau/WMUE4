Initial black carbon water was flushed out.
It's a single cartridge under sink unit.
Flushed for an additional 1/2 hour, still tasted like chlorine.
Installed and flushed unit for 1/2 an hour.
Kept it for a week.
I was surprised to find the water tastes great.
I figured maybe it was loaded with more carbon?
Although the GE required buying the plastic under sink unit, the filter itself is half the price of the Watts and it's easier to change.
Water tasted like chlorine.
I'm happy now.
I don't know why the Watts would not work.
Kept giving it a try.
I thought it might be defective so I returned it and bought the same model from another store.
I returned it and bought the GE fxutc.
This unit also performed poorly with the same results.
The Watts cartridge is much heavier than the GE.

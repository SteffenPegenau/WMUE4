When I complained about to the vendor(Organizeit) I was told that is what I have ordered.
So the battom line is that you spend around $100 and receive back maybe $20 or $30.
No, it is not.
This is simply the false advertisment.
On the other hand some holes that should be there do not exist.
And there is return policy.
I have placed my order based on picture that shows large unit not the half it.
I have received half of it.
DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY.JACEK
Unit itself is a piece of garbage.
Very convienient but for the Orgenizeit.
There are some holes that are predrilled and it shoud not be.
The instruction is very unclear.
First of all your picture shows large unit.
If you want to return this "piece of art" you have to spend additional money from your own pocket.
If you have handy $80(cost and shipping) you better off giving it to charity.
And they might charge you restocking fee.

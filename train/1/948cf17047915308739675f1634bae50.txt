Try out the flash when taking a photo.
I like to call it the "noise producer."
I couldn't tell.
You cannot understand the playback for the recording you just made.
I wasn't expecting much at all, but I got nothing.
You hear mumbling against static.
The first thing you should do after purchasing this product is to test the "voice recorder."
It's not even worthy as a kid's toy.
Buy them a VideoNow or a Barbie cam.
I thought the video it was producing was something called the "blur effect."
This is the worst camera I have ever used.
Everything captured by the video recorder was unintelligible.<br /><br />Please do not spend money on this.
It has to charge first; that's just like a one time use camera.<br /><br />When you're satisfied with those two features, the next one for testing is the video camera.
It has a video camera?
Wait.

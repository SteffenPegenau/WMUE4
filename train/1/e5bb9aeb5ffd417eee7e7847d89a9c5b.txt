It's lucky that I had a crossword puzzle that needed to be finished, because otherwise I would have fallen asleep.
I saw the previews for it and it looked good, so we rented it as soon as it came out.
This is NOT good.
Skip this movie.
I don't recommend this movie by any stretch of the imagination.
But I'm quite disappointed in the fact that I really wanted to like this movie!
The story, the acting, and the monster looked completely gay.
Well, the title of my review pretty much sums up how I feel about this movie.
Everything about this movie sucked.
That one was good.
I'm still baffled as to why they bothered with a sequel, I certainly won't waste my money on it, and I can only hope that this doesn't turn into a franchise a'la Jason.
If you want a good creepy movie, get The Ring.
Not good at all.
Of course, horror movies these days aren't meant to be scary anyways, so that was no surprise.
Do yourself a favor and watch some good movies tonight.

Also, this cd does not play well in most record players Nice going, "Misfits".... yuck, stay far away.YOU GOTTA BUY THIS!!!
If u can.OK, so i bought this cd from amazon.com because i must have felt i needed to waste money, because that's what i did.
Also, the keyboardist obviously doesn't know how to play drums, because he doesn't.
Man she sux!
Maybe you're like me, and money grows on your ankles.
You can if u want tho.
(but maybe not?
DO NOT buy this cd.
This helps.Overall, you must buy this cd, but don't waste your money on it because it sucks soooooooo bad.
)FINAL WORDS: This album may have been good if it came out in the 90's, but for a 2003 cd, what's goin' on guys?
!
First off, i don't know why the lady sounds like she has a frog in her throat when she sings.
Try to get it on tape.
The hip-hop influences on this cd are obvious, and the guy from Linkin' Park adds a helping hand with some singing.
You gotta buy this album!!!
First of all, lemme say this album blows.

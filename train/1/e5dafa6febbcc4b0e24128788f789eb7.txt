No surprises.
I feel sorry for all the actors in this film and I would suggest that they leave this one off their resume's.
Of course with Ron Jeremy in the film, what could one expect?
What a joke..or maybe thats what it was supposed to be.
Ok, So I thought, what the heck I will give it a shot....I love horror films, even B-rated ones, but I must say....THIS WAS HORRIBLE.
There was nothing that suggested it should have ever been released.
Acting was REALLY Bad.
Perhaps then I might have been entertained.
Don't waste your money people.
What a waste of time.
Screenwriting obviously is a challenge for the producer, writer, etc.
Nothing cleaver or original here.
Plot was horrible.
C'mon.
The guy who produced this junk needs to seriously think about getting a new job.
The lines were so predictable.
I hated this film and thought that I could have better spent my time chopping up a turkey...a jive turkey.
My 17 year old son has made movies better than this one.

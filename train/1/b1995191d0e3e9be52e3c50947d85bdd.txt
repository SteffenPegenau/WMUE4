Are you kidding?
We have a completely different society.
This book is useless.
In addition, this book is annoying and condescending.
Common sense, moderation, and not eating junk food is the quick summary of this book.
We are over-booked and exhausted.
I wish that we weren't.
It is rushed.
But to overhaul our society in order to lose a few pounds is a tall order.
If those things are something new to you then I would recommend that you read this book.
I'm tired.
I don't know many Americansthat have that luxury.
We work long hours.
For the 99.9% of the rest of us that have ever been on a diet--there is nothing new here.
I don't think I'm up to it.
For example, the author recommends that each meal is to be eaten on fine china and enjoyed slowly.
The tips and recommendations in this book are (for the most part)unrealistic in this country.

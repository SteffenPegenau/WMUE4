(Haven't sent it yet, so let's hope they live up to their word!
!I was so angry that I called Tyco directly.
This thing only moves quickly when going sideways.
Luckily, they provided me with good customer service by allowing me to send them the stupid thing back.
There's a number on the box!
Try it if you're unhappy.
I've never seen him pass up an R/C toy for coloring!!!
We tried to run this thing on some dirt and low grass---slow as Christmas when trying to go forward!
My son played with it once...then said he'd rather color.
The commercial shows this thing tearing through all terrain, jumping, going forwards and backwards!
)BLAH TOY!!!!!!!!!!
They promise to send me a voucher to purchase another Tyco vehicle that works better.
These are the key words here---going forwards and backwards.
Amen to the folks who have said this is a stupid toy!
!
It just spends around senselessly.

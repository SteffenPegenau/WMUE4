!I am all for a Blu-Ray release of Glee.
Tina?
Even Puck and Quinn?!!!3.
Kurt?!
Artie?
A lot of people feel they should also release a DVD copy of the second half of the season for those customers who bought the first half as Season 1 Volume 1.
A shame really because this is a FANTASTIC SHOW.
Where are the kids?
More commentaries?!
That's just poor form Fox!2.
It is a wonderful, original and fun show and I love it!But...1.
Rachel and Finn are nice and all but where's the GLEE CLUB?
Mercedes?
The extras leave a lot to be desired.
THE SHOW GETS 5 STARS!!!!
What's with the cover?!!!
I know they are overworking those kids but maybe they could have postponed this release until they could put out something that would satisfy the rabid fans they have created.Customers like me who are looking for a quality product will definitely be put off by this kind of release.
I mean, what's the point of naming a product Volume 1 if you're not going to put out a Volume 2.

Buy 'Ken Burns JAZZ.'
So you may be thinking, "What's so bad about it?
Why, you may ask?Well, it looks really good.
Why anybody would actually pay $$$ for this is beyond me.
His recordings are legendary, and during his 40+ year career, he made some of the finest recordings in the history of jazz music.And since he's so important, he's got tons of compilations.
Count Basie is considered an American icon, and he deserves SO MUCH BETTER!!!
Buy 'The Complete Atomic Basie.'
"The sound quality is HORRID!
Count Basie is an American legend.
But 'Golden Legends' stands out, and not in a good way, either.
And it's cheap, too.
Anything else will do.
It's got most of Basie's standards and some underrated songs.
Madacy, just like all of their other releases, makes no effort whatsoever to clean this up.Overall, buy 'Greatest Hits (RCA).'
But do not buy this.NOT RECOMMENDED.

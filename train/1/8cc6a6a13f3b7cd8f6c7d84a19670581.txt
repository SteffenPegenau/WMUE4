How hard is it to make a Superman game?
Why's he in a virtual world?
Third, there are so many glitches in this game that at times, I thought that I was using my X-ray vision.
And fourth, Superman flying through RINGS!
I just hope that SOMEONE can revive the Superman license by making at least a somewhat fun game.
Why not a real one?
This game could have been so much more.
There are so many problems with this game, I can't finish this review.
I mean, I can understand how in the game, he might need a health bar, but I would have like for him to at least take a few hits without dying.
Argh!
In actuality, the wall somehow disappeared due to an apparent glitch.
For one, the control is pathetic.
The character you control might look like the big 'S', but he ain't no Superman.
And what's with the fog?
Second, Superman flying through rings?
I don't understand.
Why does he fly so damn slow?

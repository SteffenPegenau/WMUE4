Do yourself a favor please avoid!!
Listen to Superjoint Ritual those guys know how to shred.
NOT HEAVY!
This even has the Slipknot vocalist on a track called F%#K You (so original isn't it?)
[...].
What is metal turning to, No wonder Phil left these guys.
This is so commercial to appeal to the mall goth kids.
All hail the epitome of metal... Phil Anselmo!
Phil will never sell Out.
Please skip this one.
!I once regarded Vinnie and Dime as gods but what the hell happened to them, this sounds so watered down and lame.
Terrible recycled riffs, uninspired nu metal vocals.
!
Sound like ALice In Chains mixed with Korn.
They know how to keep metal alive.
Listen to Superjoint Ritual!!
Smart man that Phil Anselmo.
Check out "explode" without a doubt the biggest [...] song ever recorded.
This album makes me laugh.

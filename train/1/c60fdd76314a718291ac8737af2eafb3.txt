What about Randy Bachman?
I love kd but this is a terrible disappointment.
What about Burton Cummings?
Neil Young has recorded thousands of songs.
This sucks.
And there are hundreds of other Canadian songs I would like to hear.
And no one will ever match Joni doing it.
What about Robbie Robertson?
Why do we have to do the same old ones again that EVERYONE does a cover of.
And as for Joni's lovely song A Case of You, Diana Krall does a much more original version on her Live In Paris lp.
Get Joni's hits instead of this lp and Krall's Live in Paris.
The one star is for the lp cover and concept.
What about Paul Anka?
What about The Band?
Same with Cohen.

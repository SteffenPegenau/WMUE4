Should look amazing in HD.
This should have been a reference title in high-def and it's not even in the ball park.
"Now it's time to look at my first Blu-ray Discs.
The image is muddy looking, lacking in crisp, clean detail.
This title should not have been released in Blu-ray format.
Naturally, my hand swerved towards The Fifth Element.
I'm going to come out and say it looks bad,it is easily the worst looking high-definition title I've seen yet, and I've seen 30+ titles now.
The colors don't quite pop off the screen like they should.
Yeah... it should.
Seriously, if you compare the upscaled Superbit standard-definition DVD to this, the Blu-ray Disc looks only marginally better.
Wow... and not the good kind.
In fact...
But it doesn't.
Obvious choice, right?
My brow furrowed in troubled surprise at this point.
The title was an amazing bit of reference work on standard DVD, and that Superbit version was awesome.

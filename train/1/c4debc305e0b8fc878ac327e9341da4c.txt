Yeah, backpacking but by himself?
The only star here are the beaches of Thailand!
First of all, we know NOTHING about the main character Richard or WHY he is in Thailand.
I just feel that the characters were too mysterious.
Then once the three stooges find "the beach" it just gets way too confusing.
The rest were perfectly fine!
It was fast paced, confusing and boring.
The problems with this film are many.
The concept of this film is great-the movie well,-- IT'S BAD!!
It would of been interesting to see WHAT made him go there?
Who would go mad in a beautiful beach like that??
How did "the community" end up there????
It would of been more interesting to see more about the Thai culture, after all it was filmed there!
In my opinoin it would of been more interesting if only the three of them would find the island on their own instead of using a dumb map left by a crackhead.
And then Richard goes MAD but WHY???

Poor krill.
Maybe slime is part of the deal.
It took forever to get to me.
It went from Pheonix to Dallas, to Wisconsin, to Indianopolis to me over a two week period.
First it gets plucked from its freezing water only to be squeezed to death and have its oil distributed out of Pheonix, Az (The hottest place on the planet).
If I don't get it, set me straight before I return it.Maybe my vote will change!
Can't be sure if the product is bad or another factor played a part.
The experation date was good.
I don't get krill oil in genral.

It then took a tour of FedEx in America.
It was sealed by plastic and there was a seal under the lid.
Two months ago I started with fish oil from Wonder Labs.
Source Naturals seems pretty good.Only two things can be possible problems I suspect.
I mean, it has traveled more than I will ever travel.
It wasn't slimy or it didn't stink nearly that much.

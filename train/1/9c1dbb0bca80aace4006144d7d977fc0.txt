Currently the TV is sitting in our guest room...
Half the screen went green/red... and the part to repair it cost $400 and was out of stock.
The first repair cost $500 from a Samsung Service tech.
They all have died or been repaired multiple times.
I fixed it the 2nd time for $80 in parts.
I was thankfully able to buy the powerboard and install in myself the 2nd time.
I don't think anyone owns a working version of this set.
Sadly they don't make Televisions like they used to.
Worst TV purchase ever.
And it finally died this year... about 5 years after my purchase.
The 2nd repair was needed 15 months later.
Just outside of the warranty...
Samsung is of no assistance.
The first repair occurred about 18 months after my purchase.
First two repairs required a new power board because caps blew.
I did some research online and this TV in general is a lemon.

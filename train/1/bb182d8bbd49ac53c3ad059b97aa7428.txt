The cheezy little staples that hold the line on mine broke.
It isn't a mower.
You can't get most of them.
Can't.
Lines break frequently at the staples rather than wearing out.
Too heavy and unwieldy for general whacking.
Bad design.
They don't sell through other distributors so you can't get them from there either.
Pick something else or glue some wheels on your week whacker.
Works OK for what it is, discounting the cheap B&S; engine that's designed to last one season and be unrepairable at any reasonable cost.I got it to do heavy brush around a fence line.
Motor, belt, disk and a couple wheels.
After welding them a few times, I tried to buy a new disk.
Works for that.
Nope.
It's a simple device.
No easy height control.
Don't try getting repair parts from Swisher.

The appearance leads one to deduce she has great skill-which is not the question or concern.
The book is one I personally would never buy again-period.
I am African American and my shock at the lack of respect for the consumer from this author is immense.
The recipes were repetitive and extremely small in number.
Shame on anyone who buys it .
This is the worst item I have ever gotten on amazon.
Being African American has nothing to do with it.
It was overpriced, and the amount of recipes were ridiculously small in number and repetitive.
I appreciate it-sincerely.
You have been warned!!
This was a waste of my money and time.
!I must reply to the comment.
The cover pictures a beautiful kind looking African American lady.
I did not learn anything from it.
I own over 100 cookbooks and spoke from my personal perspective.

That was not the case.
In the words of my four year old, "Mommy this isn't very fun!
My daughter is four & loves all things Barbie.
(...) Very surprised & disappointed that "Barbie" (Mattel) fell short of the quality standard we are used to having with this line.
It's always broken!"
Her favorites are the "princess" type Barbies.
The horses don't stay attached to the carriage.
As soon as we got it out of the box I could tell it wasn't going to last for long.
My daughter grew tired of having to fix the carriage and horses time and time again.
She was very excited to finally get a carriage.
I was hesitant to pay $30 but decided it would give her countless hours of fun.
If I had to pick the best part of this item, it would be the horses.
The carriage now sits on the shelf collecting dust.
They are the only thing that doesn't fall apart.
It looks great but as soon as you touch it parts start to fall off.
The gold pieces fall off and won't stay on.

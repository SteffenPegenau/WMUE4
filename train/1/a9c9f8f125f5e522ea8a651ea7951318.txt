He loved it.
It is also hard to take away a blanket that your kids really love.
Most kids have a favorite and this is not the one you want them to choose!
I would caution anyone who purchases this blanket!
There is another chenille by wamsutta that is better!
It is his favorite.
Recently when he woke up my sister said she went to get him, and he pointed to his neck.
Each time he goes to bed at night he still searched out the blanket from when he was 6 months old.
They started to wear down quickly after washing and drying them.
He looked at her and said "Uh Oh!"
The blankets wear away and become almost see through.
I purchased this blanket for my nephew when he was only 6 months old.
She noticed during the night, some blanket strings had wrapped around his neck and were very tight.
He is now two and I have purchased 2 more of these blankets.
However, there were no hanging strings.

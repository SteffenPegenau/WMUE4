I hope MAYBE someday he will make an album on par with the quality of SIGN, god evn , THE GOLD EXPERIENCE.
The last album that had any edge to it was half Of EMANCIPATION.
It sounds like he is falling asleep on every track.
That album is Sgt.
This new guy is too technical.
Peppers compared to this.
No invention or excitement.
Chaos and Disorder is 3000 times better than this.
I wish him luck, but his music stinks now.
I think Prince is too far out in the Jesus atmosphere to ever come back down.
(...)
Yet, i dont think so.
One good song is all I can find on this album.
Oh, also, his new drummer is technically good, but give me Michael B. any day of the week.
Prince, MAKE ANOTHER ROCK ALBUM.

I just have no words for this!
I gotta say what this author is talking about is abuse!
On one page he even says "chastize in private for the parent's safety.
That's crazy!!!
For you are abusing your child!!!
I have a 7 yr old who will be 8 soon.
No I'm not Christian, but as a child I was raised in a Christian home.
Guess what, she listens, she behaves, she loves, and she is very happy!!
Be very ASHAMED!!!
!
I couldn't read the whole book because it was pissing me off.
I don't need to beat my daughter into submission!!!
I don't spank her at all.
I love my daughter and she loves me and she is a well behaved child!!
I ask why do the parents need to be safe if it's not abuse?
I don't need a rod to discipline my child.
I talk to her and give her time out.
For all of you who love this book....be ashamed!!
Especially if you have to hide!
Any parent who uses this method should be ashamed and should be turned in for abuse!!

I hope it solves my dog's barking problem soon or this is going to get expensive.Meant to rank 3 stars.
Might it hurt them in long run?In the Operations Manual it says the battery life of the product should be approximately one month, depending on how much the dog barks.
Maybe stops after a while.
Oooops.
Better than shock collars but would prefer a better method.
Is this okay?
Kind of works... dog hears noise, looks confused, and then barks again.
Amazon.com says 8lbs but PetSafe's website does not list size requirements.
Actually very loud, annoying BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP.Confusing packaging and advertising conflict re: appropriateness for small dogs.
My dog does not bark very much but the battery only lasted about six nights of wear.
Also concerned in general for dog's ears.
My dog is 7lbs.
(He barked about 3x per night.)
The replacement batteries are made by PetSafe and they cost about $10 for a two-pack.
I thought it would be high-pitched noise that only dogs could hear.

STAY AWAY FROM BP MEDICAL SUPPLIES!
They finally instructed me to return the item.
I have been an amazon.com customer since 2003 and buy lots of things here.
After paying $95.00 for it I was shocked to see what I received.
No one called back.
I filed a claim with amazon.
I called no one answered and I left a message.
No answer and no call backs.
This has been a horrible experience.
So called back and left more messages.
When I emailed BP Medical about the item they emailed me back and told me to call the next day.
For starters my item arrived late.
I purchased the AlcoMate Breathalyzer from BP Medical Supplies here on amazon.com.
They sent me the breathalyzer in a case with NO manufacture's box or let alone instructions.
I have only had only great experiences until now.
The battery compartment came damaged.
BP is still stalling and I have to push my claim further.

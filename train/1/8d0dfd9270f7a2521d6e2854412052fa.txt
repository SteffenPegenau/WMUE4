It's about Motorola and that waste of a phone they call RAZR.
Low, low, low volume was a BIG problem.
No worries.
No dropped calls.
I also bought the software to make my own ring tones and sync up with Outlook, but the software was quirky and had a mind of its own too.I rarely write reviews, but am compeled to urge you NOT to buy the RAZR.
Amazon should change that so users can give it NO stars.
Fast command response.
No dust.
Read on.After owning three (3) RAZR phones in 3 months, I gave up.
Too bad I had to give this phone 1 star.
Slow and sluggish command responses.
It was no hassle and very easy.
Dust under the view screen was a problem.
Software works like it's supposed to.
Good volume.
The one I own now (thanks to Cingular) is the Sony W600, and have no regrets.
Good news was that Cingular was very nice each and every time I had to do an exchange.
Dropped calls.
But this review isn't about Cingular.

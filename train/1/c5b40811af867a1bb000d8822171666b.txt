This piece of junk didn't even come with a manual.
Shame on you, Cakewalk.
Same error message.Was there any quality assurance done on this project by Cakewalk?
Didn't work.
I want my software to work right out of the box.
I don't have time to track down solutions to problems that should have been caught by Cakewalk's QA dept.
Tried to rip one track from a CD.
Tried same CD.
Tried a second CD -- 5 more times.
I am seriously disappointed.
Installed, following directions precisely.
You open the box and it contains a CD and a piece of paper telling you to visit Cakewalk's website.
Went online to obtain driver updates.
Lame, lame, lame.
Didn't work.
Tried 5 times.

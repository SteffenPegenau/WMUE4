And then again.
Why do we have them?
This is an attempt to argue Huntington's theory, which is fine, but in the wrong method.Entitled "Identity and Violence", Sen covers very little on Identity and even less on violence.
Just way too many questions about Identity and Violence are left unanswered, unaddressed, and avoided in a book called "Identity and Violence".
Sen states that we all have multiple IDs.
What is it?
What are the connections between ID and violence.
What influences IDs?
Why is it used?
Why is it bad?
And then again with the added ideal that focusing on one ID is dangerous.
Thankfully this book is not very long, so my disappointed is only so deep.
He then restates it.
It must be said that if Samuel Huntington did not write his "Clash of Civilizations", then this book would not have written or published.
He repeats this too many times.What Sen fails to address, recognize or grasp is the concept of an Identity.
Is violence bad?
What is violence?

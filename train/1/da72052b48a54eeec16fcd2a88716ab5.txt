It would beep when I pushed talk but nothing else.
But yesterday it was doing the same as the other SPPA1050.
I had it for one month.
After three days, my first time using it, it stopped transmitting my voice.
Sony support has been good but the equipment or the repair of is very low.
An update, I got my third 1050 last week.
Then unknown to me it would turn the answering machine on.
When I picked up the 1050 it wouldn't connect to the line, only beeped.
It would not connect to the line.
If I disconnected it for a period of time {overnight} it would work for about five minutes.
I went to another phone to finish.
I returned it and they sent me another.
I don't use it that much, so I do not know when it failed.
A day later it failed.
I never checked the recording capability or any other functions.
After loosing trust in it.
I pulled the plug and Sony wants to send me a forth.
I didn't install it for a year.
My Sony SPPA940 failed a year ago and they gave me a SPPA1050.

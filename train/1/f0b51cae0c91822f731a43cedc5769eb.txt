Thats it.
After spending over a month searching web sites and trying upgrades, even 4 different window programs, 98, xp sp1, 2 and 3.
!
Nothing.
Now, at some point i was able to get the software to locate my router, and it would connect, but i couldnt surf the net.
The third strrike came when I could get everything connected, and even surf the net, for about 2 mins!!!!!!!!
The connection would still be there, but browsers wouldnt work.
Boy, let me tell you, this hunk of junk too the cake!
DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For starters, it would take FOREVER to find my router, even when it was 2 feet away.
First let me say, setup was easy.
From then on its been a nightmare.
Strike 2.
I have owned a few netgear products over the years with little to no problems.
Ive got 2 xboxs, 2 wiis and a few other laptops that have no trouble finding my router.
Strike 1.

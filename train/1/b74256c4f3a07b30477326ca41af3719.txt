Then, the Nubra would seamlessly fit, like an extension of the body.
The cups create an unnatural shape.
I've worn it once to the movie theater.
I couldn't move much for fear of the Nubra falling off.
Never again!
The top and sides of the cups created an obvious outline under my shirt that didn't even look like the bra-line of a normal bra.
It doesn't.
You can see why in the picture; the edges jut out.
It looks off.
It's not "freedom and movement."
It's not "smooth and invisible under sheer clothing."
I resorted to sneakily squishing it against my chest to try and make it stick.The worst part is it looks bad.
The front closure wouldn't stay closed.
The Nubra Feather-Lite is the worst bra ever.
When I put it on, I was very aware of it sticking to me.
The cups should start very thin at the top and sides and get gradually thicker.
The silicone cups allow no air circulation so I was sweating and the Nubra was coming off.

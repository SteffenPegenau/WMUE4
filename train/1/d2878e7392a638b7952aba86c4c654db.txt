Don't.
You won't care!
I loved Jerry Maguire and when I heard the director and star were making another movie, I was first in line.I learned something watching this movie.
Life is short and there are two hours of my life that I will never get back.This is the worst movie ever made.
The plot makes no sense, Tom Cruise is horribly disfigured so there's nothing to look at.
I read another review that said the plot was full of holes.
Bar none.
You won't spend time afterwards picking out plot holes, you will just not care AT ALL.
Awful.
You may be thinking I'm exagerating and try watching it yourself.
Seriously.
Horrid.
Showgirls was a better movie.
Additional time thinking about this movie will just waste more time.Glitter was a better movie.
Awful.P.S.
That's the beauty of this movie.

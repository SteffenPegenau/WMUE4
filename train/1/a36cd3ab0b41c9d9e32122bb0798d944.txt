My husband is REALLY looking forward to using this!
Says it should be easy.
[updating review] - spoke to customer service today, they were surprised and apologetic.
Supposed to slot the center piece, which narrows down at the tube ends, into the end tubes.
They are having fedex come and pick up the stand, will inspect and get a new stand back to us.
Very frustrating.
Husband just spent a half hour trying to fit the two end pieces to the center piece.
Thinks this may be resulting in the end not fitting on.
Ordered this for father's day.
We tried together to no avail.
Pieces simply won't fit together.
They simply will not fit.
Husband says there is a metal bead the isn't filed down on the inside of each of the end tubes.
Fingers crossed.
That said, I'm not sure how long this will all take.

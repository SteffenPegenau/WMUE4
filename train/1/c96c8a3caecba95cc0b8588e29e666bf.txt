Sounds great right?
He can see what others see.
I think the writer and director had their eyes closed when they created this garbage.
I would have expected something much better from BBC than this failure at a horror movie.
I fell asleep watching this movie because it was so boring, but I did rewind to finish it so I could give a fair review.
Not to mention that the final twist was very predictable.
Somebody just woke me up to give this review.
The acting was horrible.
Keep moving along... nothing to see here.
I am glad to give this movie it's first 1 star review.
If it was up to me I would give it 0 stars.
The ending was so bad that it made me chuckle.
It's a story about a hypnotist who is helping the cops track down a serial killer.
Trust me, it's not great at all.
The story was silly.
It wasn't scary or suspenseful.
In fact, don't waste your time reading any more of my words about how bad it is.
Don't waste your time seeing this film.

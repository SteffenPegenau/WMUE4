Where did he get that?
Wrong again, he was wounded by a spider.
Aragorn is with the 2 hobbits.
I found this book very interesting until I got to the synopsis of the Lord of the Rings.
3 - The guy totally skips over when Aragorn is crowned!
I am quite irritated with this book!
2 - It mentions that Frodo is wounded in battle and captured by Orcs.
I now have no idea if half the facts are even true!
I really wanted to learn something about JRRT, but I learned something else - Mike doesn't know what he's talking about.
And, I KNOW some of the other facts aren't true...I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who hasn't read LOTR at all, because the synopsis is totally wrong.
That is half of the point of ROTK!
Wrong.
I found four mistakes!
Tiis is an easy read, but Mike sure didn't read LOTR!
4 - Lotho Simple?
It's Lotho Sackville-Baggins!
1 - Mike says that Legolas, Gimli, AND Aragorn are in a boat 2gether going down the Anduin and Frodo and Sam are alone.

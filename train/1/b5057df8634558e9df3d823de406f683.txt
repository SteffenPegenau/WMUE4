I'll give it one more chance.
I contacted Haier and they said such problems are unusual.
The side of the oven also would get very hot.
Today I received the replacement and (surprise!
I boxed it up and returned it.
Before its arrival though, I thought I could use the wobbly microwave.
I tested it in different locations just to be sure it wasnt the counter.
I thought this microwave was a bargain.
When I received the first one, I set it on the counter and realized that it wobbled.
Third time's a charm, I hope.
it wobbled also.
Im sending this one back also.
Apparently, due to poor manufacturing, the base of this microwave was uneven.
I contacted Amazon and they promptly sent out a replacement.
surprise!)
Thats when I discovered that it continually lost power (I checked it on several outlets).

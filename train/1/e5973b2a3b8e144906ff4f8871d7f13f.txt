SEVEN TRACKS FROM ONE HEART HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY RELEASED OVER THE YEARS.
THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 7 NEW TRACKS HERE.
BY GOD!
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE CELINES MUSIC AS WELL AS HER VOICE.
DID SHE THINK HER FANS WOULD BE SO STUPID AS TO BELIEVE THIS IS NEW MUSIC.
BUT I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER BE A BIG FAN AGAIN.
THE GENERAL CONSENSUS BY CELINE'S FANS'IS SELLOUT!!!
YOU'VE OFFICIALLY REACHED MARIAH CAREY STATUS WITH THIS C.D.-LOSS OF FAITH!!!
AND I'M DEFINATELY NOT ALONE!!!!!!!
!CONGRATULATIONS CELINE.
THIS WILL COST HER MORE THAN SHE CAN IMAGINE.
SAY THIS IS PARTIALLY NEW MUSIC.
!
CELINE DION.
"ONE HEART".
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID.
AT LEAST BE HONEST WITH YOUR FANS.

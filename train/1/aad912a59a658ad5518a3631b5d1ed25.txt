If they do not match, do not prepare it for shipment.
I believed this would add a high degree of reliability to assure correct, and accurate order.
It is not what I orderd, do not pack it!
I could have paid less for this item.
My Grand Daughter was very disappointed!!!!
I chose this venue because ad stated that Amazon packed, and shipped, this item.
If it ain't correct, don't ship it!
Amazon excersizes great control here.
Amazon has replied that they have no control over what is in vendor's wharehouses, or what is shipped.
I received "Coraline (Single Edition w/2D).
I ordered "Coraline (Single Disc Edition w/3D)".
Do not advertise what you cannot do.
No?
So why does Amazon advertise that they personally pack, and ship, order??
Look at product.
Look at order.

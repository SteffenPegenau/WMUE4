Geesh!
Bleah!
I suffered so much watching this movie to the end.
It reminds me of an 80's sci fi movie the kind you laugh at now in the present.....generic and cheesy.
It looked very unrealistic.
This is the most horrific movie I have ever seen.
It is boring as hell.
Through out the whole thing I had been wishing it to end and wish I had been watching something else.
Poor me, poor me.
The CGI wasn't very impressive either.
I really do not care about the acting, but I was expecting the action to excite.
Wait until your library has it and check it out free of charge.
I was browsing through the movies and figured this one would be exciting.
It did nothing for me.
You could tell it was CGI.
Two hours long, que horror!!!

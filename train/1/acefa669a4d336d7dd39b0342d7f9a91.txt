Obviously not.And they also made a trite, saccharine-sweet movie.
There ought to be a law against that.
After all, they completely altered the ending.
!
How dare they?
They destroyed Orwell.
I'm still trying to figure that out.I think perhaps they did.
Have these myopic movie-makers never considered that?
These people actually destroyed that great author.
I don't know.
Defamation, slander, anything.What if Orwell wasn't writing about Russian communism, persay, but rather, about the nature of totalitarianism in general (which the world and Russia and this country are NOT rid of, by the way!)?
Thus, they made the great Orwell seem trite.
I can't believe it.
I mean completely, 180 degrees, different from Orwell's pure and clear intention.
Did they do it deliberately?

For instance, during Shoot to Thrill, Brian screams something, but his microphone is on his belt.
Buy the VHS or Brazilian DVD to get the full effect of the show.
During Back in Black.
He says "hey mama" but his mike is no where near his mouth.
They aren't overdubbed with other audio tracks.
Buy the VHS or Brazilian DVD version of Donington.
There are lots of differences in the US DVD.
The sound is great, but its not from Donington.
One of the solos doesn't line up during Fire Your Guns.
The undoctored versions of the show also LOOK DIFFERENT.
I don't have time to name them all.
I strongly discourage the buying of this DVD.
Thunderstruck even sounds different.
The show took place near a storm, but on the US DVD, there aren't any storm clouds.
The original video and audio was fine.
They should've left it alone.

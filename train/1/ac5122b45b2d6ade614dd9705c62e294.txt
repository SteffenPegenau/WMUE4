The story starts with an explanation of the universe, which is vague and far too long.
Right?NOT!
There have only been a few books that I've ever stopped reading.
This was the era where Heinlein, Clarke, Pohl, Williamson, and Assimov were still actively writing.
It must be good.
The story is told in such a confusing manner that I really never made a connection with anyone and those that I ran into more than once, I could care less about.
Please, someone explain to me how this piece of trash won a Hugo?
Then in Chapter 2 the action starts and NOTHING IS EVER EXPLAINED AGAIN!
I was excited to start the book.
The action consists of people walking to and from meetings and talking mostly about insignificant items.
The writing is horrible.
Was everything else that year that bad?
This is one of them.
And this won a Hugo?I stopped after 160 pages and put myself out of my misery and moved on to the latest Varley novel, which was a breath of fresh air.
It won a feakin' Hugo Award.

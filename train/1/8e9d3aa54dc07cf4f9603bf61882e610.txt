For software that never worked for my laptop??
Over the past 6 weeks, I've had to contact tech support 6 times.
So it appears that the only time it works is when I'm in front of my cablebox and TV!!
Do not waste your money.
Hey, great!
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Next week the problem reoccurs.
Guess what?
Every week I go back home and have to re-set the entire system and reconfigure the software.
This thing is going up on EBay shortly.UPDATE MAY '09: I just read that Sling will be offering an iPhone App for this.
They're going to charge $30.00!
I'm not home right now, and of course I can't connect yet again.
Unacceptable.
As has been noted, you have to shell out more money for the wireless bridge.
$30???
I've had the Slingbox Pro about 6 weeks now.
Basically everytime I'm not home (and not on my home network) my laptop can't connect to the Box.

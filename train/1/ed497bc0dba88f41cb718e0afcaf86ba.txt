The timer feature is the reason why I bought this item.
Do Not Buy This Product!!!
Don't Do It!!
Do Not Buy This Product!!!
This is nothing but a very expensive power strip.
If the timer is important to you, Do Not Buy This Product!!!.
The timer does not work.
The lcd works, the outlets works, but not the timer.
The worst feeling in the world is to read bad reviews of certain products and not take heed to the warnings.
It sounds like a very cool and convenient product but Do Not Buy This Product!!!
The timer feature is the only feature that doesn't work.
!
It does not work.
Do not be like me and buy this product after reading so many bad reviews about it.
I've waited 24hrs in each mode to no avail.
I've tried every program, every mode,every outlet, everything.
The set up is simple enough although the wording of the directions will have you thinking that you set it up wrong.

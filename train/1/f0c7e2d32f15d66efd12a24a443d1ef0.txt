You mean to tell us that this girl just noticed her mom had a problem.
What a chump.
That last husband of hers kidnapped her?
Tell us something we don't know.
Yeah, and I'm the tooth fairy.
All kids end up writing tell alls about their mommies.
Out of fear.
I bet money this girl never had a job in her life.
Come on guys give us a break.
You must think we are stupid Tom.
Sorry Tammy your girl is a rat.
What a fool.
She is sitting up counting her money right now.
I guess that's why Tammy stood by him for 20 years.
You have to come up with a better on than that girl.

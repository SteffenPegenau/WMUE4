Eventually I got the red ring of death several times.
I also touched the xbox 360 every hour to make sure it wasn't as hot as it was with the Nyko Intercooler on.
No red ring of death.
Anyone want a free Nyko Intercooler?
Guess what?
Anyways, after removing the Nyko intercooler I played Armored Core 4 for 8 hours and left it on for 24 hours after that.
haha *smirk*
Seems like stock cooling works just fine.
Warning everyone out there, beware of this!
What this product does is it builds up heat and draws power from the power supply which doesn't give enough juice to the other components.
I'd go with the pelican stand since MS recommends that compared to this junk.
Xbox 360 psu was designed to specifically power the 360 itself, nothing else.
You buy it so that it can extend your xbox 360's life, but what it does is actually damages your xbox 360.
This thing kept making my xbox 360 overheat within an hour or two.
It wasn't hot at all.
Wow, this product is such a POS.

Worst purchase ever.
Will be buying the FoodSaver 5-ply bag and will NEVER buy these bags agsin.
Just went to FoodSaver web site and bought 12 packs of 22 for $0.40 each.
Horrible product.
Believe me, the extra $0.10 per bag will be worth it, assuming the bags are as good as the FoodSaver unit samples.
Bags look great going into the freezer.
No problem using these.
Reviewer who gave them 5 stars either needs to check how many have failed, or works for Tilia.
Experiencing a 50% failure or higher rate.
With shipping, my 200 cost $0.30 each.
Had to order over 5 to get 30% discount and needed 12 to get over $100 to get free shipping to get the cost down.
Bought 200.
Will never buy these again.
No way, absolutely no way could these bags be considered 5-star.
Then, check the next day, more than half have are soft and full of air.

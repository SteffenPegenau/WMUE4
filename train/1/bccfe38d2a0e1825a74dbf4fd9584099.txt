Not to mention all of the things they didn't cover that they should have!
Now I hate the movie.
This book was a great book.
Arya was another one of the important characters and they didn't even follow her right.
In fact I wouldn't even recomend the movie.
I think they should have gotten a better director for the movie who would follow the book.
Murtagh is my favorite character, even though they stuck to the book with him it seemed ike they didn't follow his character traits.
I read the book after I saw the movie.
Not to mention Brom's death.
I found myself disappointed when they didn't follow the book with his death.
I would not recomend the movie to anyone who hasn't read the book.
Where Eragon got Saphira's name, and where Eragon's name came from.
It was a waste of money, and time.
They didn't seem to get the characters right.
He was in the book a lot more than they showed in the movie.
I can expect some changes in movie's that they didn't follow in the book, but that much?

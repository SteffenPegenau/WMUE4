When your spring is empty, you have to pull the magazine out, shake it, and pray you get more bb's in the rail.
The gun arrived with no laser.
The writing, in chinese.
Once I got this product for my son, the red flags went off.
You have to pull a tab each time you want to fire.
It is that bad.
It has single spring loaded rail that holds about 5 or 6 bb's.
The package, from China.
I don't know how I didn't find the rest of the reviews, I swear there were only 5 or 6, not 200+ when I ordered.
The english translations, not properly translated.
There.
I'm moving on, just a stupid tax on my part.
It is a beginner gun alright, if you are a 5 year old.Not worth packaging for a refund or even talking with the person that actually sells this garbage.
The gun is not a semi-auto, nor is it an auto, even though it has a moving switch for those.
You can put the rest of the bbs in the magazine, but it's just for storage.

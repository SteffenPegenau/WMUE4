Way to rape a good song.This is the worst excuse for a Priest album than this.
No Thanks.Hard as Iron?
Thank God for painkiller.Just avioid this.
OK, I love Priest, but this album is horrible.
Then Heavy Metal comes along with an awesome intro... and the the song falls on its butt soon afterword.
Other than that this album sucks.I'm a Rocker?
I am willing to forgive Rocka Rolla because it was their starting point, and the Ripper era if you can listen to cheesy lyrics.
Nope.Monsters of Rock?
Monstorously bad.Lovezone?
Uh, I was planning to KEEP DOWN the meal I just ate, not vomit it back up.Love Zone?
The other good track is Blood Red Skies, despite being a tad too "techno" for my tastes.
WAY EWWWWWW.Johnny B Goode?
Ewww.Love You To Death?
In the mid 80s they went downhill and released 3 bad albums, each worse than the other (Defenders of the Faith, Turbo, and now this).
Cheesy, but a good and fast paced starter.
But this is simply Priest's worst album ever.The first song is AWESOME!

I got a divorce.
What else would you call it?Tom Cruise
This baby existed, damn it!
I got married.
I dated around.
He saw her!Everyone wants to make it out like she never existed.
That's it!
I got married again.
We had a baby.
There one minute, gone the next.I mean, what do you do?
Ask Stephen Spielberg... he was here.
She got pregnant.
A REAL baby!
It didn't work out.
I'm telling you it was human spontaneous combustion.
I met a girl.
We got the birth records to prove it.
I swear to God.But....lo & behold, my wife ordered this damn Tuscan milk, thinking we were giving our baby a little extra special treat.....and poof......baby up in smoke.

but when i watched it... what a disappointment!
its a pile of rubbish!when i saw the trailer for 28 days later i thought how awesome it looked!
it didnt shock me.
!
dont see this movie!
it didnt make me think 'omg civilization culd crumble'.
i mean, what are the chances of someone getting a drop of blood in their eye?
i adored the scenes of him wandering around dead london, but when he found all those bodies in the church i was tempted to just turn off the tv... i could tell it was goning to get worse.
its just a waste of time!!
please.
i loved the look of the poster with the eyes!
it just falls apart.
and i was right!
_dont see it.
im 14 and i wasnt scared once.

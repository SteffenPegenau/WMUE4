I can't believe you accused ME of calling "That's So Raven" gay!
I mean, this is my first review EVER on Amazon.com, and I am offended that you said I called the show gay.
And really, I love Raven.
It was not me, it was Bent Tony.
Wow, I need to find another hobby...RAVEN!
Oi, yea you, Gilmore Girl.
BEN WITH A T AT THE END!!!
Every movie on DVD and VHS, watching Disney every night watching Raven.
Jeez!
RAVEN!
You tell ME something of Raven and I bet you I own it or it is coming from Best Buy or something.
I LOVE this show, because I have nothing better to do with my life.
I own every DVD AND VHS (that's a video, Gilmore Girl) and every stinkin Music CD that SHE HAS DONE.
And Bent Tony, I agree that Cory liking Oysters and Eddie liking Snails AND Oysters is just creepy (and, for Gilmore Girl's knowledge, that is CREEP WITH A Y AT THE END.)
RAVEN!
Jeez.
(For President.)

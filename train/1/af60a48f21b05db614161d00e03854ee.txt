Period.
Maybe you wake up late at night, screaming incoherently, drenched in sweat, tortured over the hell you created in 1977+.
So, yes, George you friggin' douchebag, you OWE US those films.
Suck it up.
That film made you a bajillion dollars then and in the years after.
Because those are the films that made you rich, that we loved growing up.
The films we paid for in 1977+.
Anything else is a slap in the face and an insult to every fan who made you a billionaire.
It's really simple, George.
I'm going to be that guy and say it, you OWE US the originals.
Ditto for the original releases of ESB and ROTJ.
You first released Star Wars: A New Hope in 1977.
Well, too bad.
End of discussion.
Why?
Maybe you hate them now.
You became a billionaire thanks to fans who watched your films in 1977+, not '97, 2004, whatever.

When you choose a chapter, you are just thrown into a workout, without any instruction (i.e.
Balancing Stick Series5.
Intro to Yoga2.
"Let's begin with a warrior pose").
Core Conditioning9.
Cardio Conditioning3.
Also, the description of the DVD on the back of the case says that there are three different workouts: one 30-minute and two 15-minute.
The Warrior Series4.
Obliques10.
Focus on AbdominalsAgain, this is NOT for beginners.
Strength Conditioning7.
If you are a beginner, I recommend Yoga Journal's Yoga Step by Step.
It's definitely not for beginners--there is no instruction whatsoever.
In actuality, you must choose from 10 chapters:1.
Tree Pose Series6.
I was very disappointed by this DVD.
Twist and Stretch8.
Having never done yoga before, I have no idea what a warrior pose is.
The chapter entitled "Introduction to Yoga" consists of Denise talking about yoga, but gives no demonstrations or intructions on technique.

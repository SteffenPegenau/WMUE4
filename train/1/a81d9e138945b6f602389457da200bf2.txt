I have tried it on 2 PCs, 3 MACs (it is supposed to be read both by PCs and MACs).
The computer disc came promptly, sooner than expected.
The answering machine states that it is not the technical support desk.
The disc no longer works.
We have tried it on the original computer where it worked the first time.
If I could give it less than one star, I would.
It is not damaged in any way that I can discern.
Needless to say, my childen are immensely disappointed.
The disc worked one day.
I have taken it to work and tried it on my computer at work.
This leads me to believe that I am not the only one who has had problems with this computer disc.
I purchased Virtual Springfield for my sons.
When I called the technical support number, it rings to a private residence.
Since the one time that the children used this disc, it has not worked.
Under no circumstances would I ever recommend that this item be purchased.

To top it off, I didn't like the new format - especially the budget function.
They want to charge $1.95 per minute to help with this awful software.
Thank goodness my backup data was fine.
Data was corrupted in transfer.
It converted file types wrong then there is no way to fix.
I was sick to my stomach after 8 hours of messing with it and having lost 15 years of data.
Constant crashing when customizing.
Bought Quicken 2000 on e-bay since Intuit wouldn't sell or download it to me.
It is garbage!
Quicken 2000 is a great product.
Crashes every backup.
They shouldn't even give this product away.
Full of bugs!
Support folks don't speak English.
It's horrible that Intuit has done this to us.
Can't load "budget" on toolbar because it won't be there next time I get on but others work.
I used to LOVE Quicken but upgraded to 2004 Basic to take advantage of free offer with Turbo Tax.

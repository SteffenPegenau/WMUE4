Living for yourself.
This book is not the way to live a life of meaningful relationships, and it's certanly not the way to feel good about yourself.
Thats not a way to live.
What is your purpose here on this planet?
For yourself?
Why are you here?
What kind of life is that?
No.
Don't get me wrong I am not condeming you for buying this book.
What I am doing is asking you your motives.
You really think this book is true just because someone else says so?
All he did was rip off buddhism and slap a new title on it.
Why you are buying this book, and if you are sure you want to go on living a life this book wants you to lead.
Because the author spent 10 years toiling after what made HIMSELF happy?
This book is not the way to joy.
I urge you, ask yourself, "Why do I do the things I do," and more importantly, "who do I do them for?"

I just have to tough it out until it wears off.
I sometimes get it on my skin and it is tough to remove.
I tend to get a little too much everywhere.
A solvent might do the trick, but I haven't tried that.I find the precision tip isn't so precise for me.
I need to use a little needle to unclog the tip before using.
I always have it around for emergencies.
The other day, I used it to repair the plastic latch on my medicine cabinet that had fallen off.
The glue, however, is wonderful.Great product.
I usually hold it in place for 30 seconds and then leave it to cure overnight.
In fact, I can't remove it by washing.
It also clogs every time I use it.
Be careful with the hands.
I usually use it to repair my daughter's toys.
Krazy Glue is excellent on plastic.
Once this glue dried, the latch held strongly enough to be completely usable once again.Krazy Glue dries quickly and holds tight.

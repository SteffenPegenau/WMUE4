Insurance companies are scum!
Yes, you will be cheering for John Q and will be outraged at the way he and his family are treated by a callous system that allows the family to fall through the cracks in the medical care system.Denzel Washington is, as always, terrific to watch as the poor schmuck who just never quite manages to make it, although he means well.
Police Chiefs are idiots!Despite that, however, this is a good film to watch.

BAM!
HMO's are bad.
The important thing is the message of the film-- it is a crime that in the richest country on earth there are people who cannot afford medical care.
If you watch John Q, be prepared to have all your buttons pushed.
I have to admit, I found the kid VERY annoying-- much too cute and perfect, but fortunately he wasn't on screen that much.
This is easily one of the most manipulative movies I've seen in a long time.

Doctors are only out for money!
Hospitals are cruel, uncaring places.

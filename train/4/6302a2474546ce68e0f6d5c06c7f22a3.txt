THink about it.
What the... all's i have to say is it's about time.
I've been looking forward to this for years.
Prince as the incredible musician he is should have released one a long time ago.
Let's face it Prince is an amazing guitarist.
ENjoy the music, and just the music.
Prince released an instrumental jazz album?
How the heck did he do that.
Every song on this album is exactly 14 minutes, and the album ends at exactly 56 minutes.
What can i say he's creative, as is this album.
Sort of reminecent of Emancipation: Every disc was an exact hour making it 3 hours total.
And despite how weird he is, or the fact his name was once a symbol, doesn't take away from the fact that he is extremely talented, and worth a listen for everyone.
HE is too good to be overlooked.
Alot of passion is in this music and it makes for a great album.
HE is also very innovative, and original.

I MEAN THE GAME IS S-H-O-R-T. What the... it only has 4 levels?!?!?!?!
Amazing!!!
lolYour now probably now wondering, if it's so good, why did you only give it a 4/5 overall?
They could have been rolling in the money.
Disney played it safe and didn't make that many copies to try and make sure they had some money left.
You'll find yourself extremely impressed while using your animal powers.
The game is short.
That's short even for the Sega Genesis!
The music, which also comes from the movie, is shockingly entertaining.
I'm going to make this as simple as possible.
The music actually matches the level!!!
The madness!Other than that it's an extremely good game.
The story line is exactly as in the movie.
This game makes the Sega Genesis look better than it's worth.
You'll find yourself caught dancing to it, until you realize what the heck your doing and stop any further embarrassment.
BIG MISTAKE.
Yet it's expensive due to it's rarity.

Then That boy, must become disattacted from the rest of the world.
Then hes got to meet some other underpriviledged musicians.
Add some drugs,of course.
I particularly, enjoyed this "How to be a punk rock star" Manual.
Then you will have a bunch of druged up punk rockers.
You need one more thing.
oh, and make sure the little boy(you) kills himself before people stop buying the albums.
This book seems to have alot of honesty, and really thats what you want in a Biography.
Get that boy a guitar.
It has the good and the bad.
You need a major music corporation to sign them up and expliot them.
It shows that being a punk rock star is relatively easy.
Let the dysfunctionality of his life ensue as he grows up.
Just take a normal young boy( being you) set him up in a dysfunctional life style, like a divorced family.
Give them a place to play everynight.
Thats all it takes.

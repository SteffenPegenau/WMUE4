They keep it dirty and evil.
The band is Phil Boyd on guitar and vocals and Paul Quattrone on drums.
"Enemy" is one of the strongest songs on this album.
It's much like vicious attacks on small animals.
Jesus Christ is already a fan.
The first few songs really hit you hard.
They have intensity in their music.
Live they are one of the best bands.
This is their second record.
Three songs on this record along could kill communism, or any philosophical system.
They are more hard rock than garage rock.
It sounds like big trucks driving our your parent's house.
3/5th of New Mexico will have already bought this record.
They are very direct.
Pittsburgh steel and Black Sabbath influence them.
Now they have a third member on guitar so that could be more interesting.
They supposedly recorded this album in the same room where Jimi Hendrix died.
The Modey Lemon are one of the heaviest bands now playing.
I can't wait for the next one.

This team assembled by Billy Corgan works really well together.
I don't really know what else to say except that I see this cd in my player for a long time to come.
This cd is grrrrrrreat!
Wow!
There are a few slower, sad songs such as Of a Broken Heart, but most of it is mid-tempo rock and roll.
Oh well, onto business...
I love Paz's backup vocals and the 3 guitars work really, really well together.
Just like Tony the Tiger :) I'm quite pleased at what I am hearing of this cd already and I've had it less than 24 hours now.
Most of the songs found on this disk are bright, fairly cheery and just good rock music.
I got exactly the opposite yet I am not disappointed by this.
The songs are growing on me quite well.
Of course Jimmy is great on drums as usual.
I was expecting something dark and dreamy and moody all rolled up into something deep and compelling.
It wasn't what I was expecting, though.
First reviewer?

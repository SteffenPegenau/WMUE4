More impressive on the leads, and the rhythms are pretty good too.
If you are a fan of the whole Gothenberg melodic death scene (particularly In Flames), buy it, it might not become your new favourite cd (its no Wages of Sin) but you wont regret it.
Nothing new.
No offence meant by that, its just the vibe I get.
Hehe.
Still good though.
Highlight track - Mourning in Magenta- Its good.
Thats enough guitar talk for now!
Better than In Flames in some points, completely different in others.
Its basically an American In Flames, but the guys have a had a few more guitar lessons!
Production and some of the writing etc.
Does exactly what it says on the tin.
Although I can't help thinking thats just some stigma Ive subconsciously attached because I know they are just starting out.
With this being a first release and the band being realtively small, it still has the distinct odour or being a bit amateur.
Pretty cool.

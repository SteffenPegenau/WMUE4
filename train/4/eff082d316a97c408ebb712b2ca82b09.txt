But the barrons book isnt the only book i also suggest you get the kaplan book.
:)
But the best was from my teacher.
This book was helpful.
This was one of my mistakes.
Its best 2 months before the test because there is alot to learn.
I hope you don't make the same mistake.
Make copies so that you go back and do the test over again.
I learned this a little bit.
OMG this book helped me the most.
They can give youlittle worksheets to take home for practice.
It does not matter how smart you are GO to your teacher and ask for help even if you don't need it.
I took the test last weekend.
DON"T write on the test in the book.
The barrons book gives most stategies that are going to be on the test.

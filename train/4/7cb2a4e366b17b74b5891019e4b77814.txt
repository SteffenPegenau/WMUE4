The end.WHEN??
Love.
In the first few chapters, I was like WOW!
Love.
Hate.
What a refreshing change of pace from all other romance books!
As soon as the first passionate encounter ends, this book turns into the same ole storyline as all other romance books.
I was interesting enough to keep me turning the pages, so I did give it 4 stars, but I was so disappointed in the fact that I thought I had found a refreshing change when in fact it is just like any number of thousands out there.Here is the storyline as well as 99% of all other romance books -Boy meets girl.
Hate.
are we gonna get something different?
Then what happened?
The author is actually going to allow these characters to have a smoldering, passionate romance with no misunderstandings, etc.
This is the first book I have ever read by Mary Balogh, so I didn't know what to expect.
Same ole, same ole.
It is not a horrible book, but it just isn't original and it's repetitive.

No one ever likes anyone else reviews written about said BOOK, CD, OR MOVIE.
And while most people agree it sucks or rocks.
But I'm simply beyond the point of caring because the scoring system just does not compute.
Honestly the math simply doesn't add up.
Love me hate me whatever but I just had to get that off my chest.
But what I really want to say is people unite.
I loved this movie.
Is it just me or has anyone notice the scoring system makes no sense?
You'll hate this review.
At first I thought it was just me but alas it isn't.
Holla back if your feelin me.
They hate it if it's a good review they hate it if it's a bad review and hate if it's in between.
Now I know if this gets posted I'll have 0 out of 99 people finding this helpful.
Were is the love?
A BOOK,CD, or MOVIE will have four out of five stars, or nobody wants to give any stars.

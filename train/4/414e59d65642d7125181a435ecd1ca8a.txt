2", is much better than its predecessor.
"All F***ed Up" has great music, the fast pace is very nice.
I really don't like "Short Blonde Hair" and "Misery Whip" too much.
That was too poppy, and the only standout song on that CD is "Wonderful".
Well, this CD is clearly better than Vol 1 LHTS.
"Out of My Depth" is by far the best song on here, and my favorite.
So overall, this CD is pretty good.
But this CD is much better.
"Halloween Americana", the music song, is okay, but not great.
The last track, "Songs From an American Movie Pt.
"Babytalk" is a good song, and "Rock Star" is the second-best song.
Only if the lyrics were better..."Overwhelming" belongs on LHTS; its a wimpy-poppish song.
"Good Witch of the North" isn't that good.
The first song, "When It All Goes Wrong Again", is a contrasting song to the first real song of LHTS, "Here We Go Again".
It sounds nice, and has some good music.

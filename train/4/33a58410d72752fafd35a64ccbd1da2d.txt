EMANCIPATION IS HOT!!
I dont get it!
Why would you want her to sing 90's ballads??
BUT I STILL LOVE YOU!
She would not sell!
Look, I just want to say to all those people who are complaning about wanting 90's Mariah back.
And I give a finger to all those HATERS.
Poor Mimi...YOU CANT WIN.
To be a musical artist YOU HAVE TO ADAPT OR DIE.
If Mariah sang 90's ballads, then people who have something else to complain about, like "Oh she's stuck in the 90's".
I just want ya'll to know THIS IS 2005!!!!
I want to know what kind of music do you people listen to who are writing the negative reviews?
None of you could be REAL Mariah fan's...unless ya'll want her to fail.
and so is SAY SOMETHING, AND SHAKE IT OFF.
4/5 stars...cause nobody is perfect...there's always roomfor improvement, otherwise I'd give u a 5.
CIRCLES IS DAT JOINT!
Barbara Streisand or something?

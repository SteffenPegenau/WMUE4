I THOUGHT THE MICHELLE CHARACTER WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR CHRISTIAN IF HE WAS REALLY READY TO SETTLE DOWN.
I THOUGHT THIS SEASON WAS GOOD.
IT JUMPED AROUND AT TIMES AND LEFT US HANGING ON SOME ISSUES, BUT OTHER THAN THAT I LIKED IT.
AS USUAL.
I WAS SAD TO SEE JULIA GO.
CHRISTIAN IS HOT!!!
THIS CHARACTER WAS THE ONLY ONE BESIDES KIMBER THAT HE HAD A CONNECTION WITH AND ACTUALLY HAD MEANINGFUL SEX WITH..
POOR SEAN JUST COULDN'T CATCH A BREAK.
THEY BOTH HAVE SKELETONS IN THEIR CLOSET.
THE ISSUE OF COLOR MADE NO DIFFERENCE.
HE MAKES UP FOR WHAT IT LACKS AT TIMES.
THIS SEASON WILL DEFINITLY MAKE MY COLLECTION.
I KNOW SHE'LL BE BACK.
I THOUGHT JULIAN AND SANAA HAD GREAT CHEMISTRY.
I ALSO THOUGHT THE WRITING OF THE DISRESPECT THAT HE SHOWED TOWARD KIMBER WAS NOT NECESSARY.

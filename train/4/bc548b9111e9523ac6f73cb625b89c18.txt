For me, the visual aspects of film are more important than any other elements, like plot or dialogue.
(The soundtrack is pretty hissy.)
It's such a tired premise.
I put off watching it for a long time because of the amnesia angle.
I hope someone like KINO takes this opportunity for a restoration.
I liked this much more than the other reviewers.
This is, of course, due to John Alton's genius.
I also found the story very engaging.
That's why I love Noir.
But when I finally watched THE CROOKED WAY, I was enchanted.
There are moments of stunning beauty, and some images that are the very essence of Noir iconography.
(Like multiple personality disorder, the kind of amnesia you see in these films rarely happens in real life.
If you are a Noir fan, do not miss this film.
And this film, visually, is just as noir as it gets.
These films make it seem like a common occurance.)
I see that the dvd is now out of print.

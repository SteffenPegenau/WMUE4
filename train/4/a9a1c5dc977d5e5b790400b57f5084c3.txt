I don't want to compare this album to A Rush Of Blood To The Head.
I am a huge fan and this album is everything I wanted it to be.
I don't give this album five stars because I would like to hear a bit more guitar on this album.
The sound is not groundbreaking but who wants Coldplay to sound like anything but Coldplay?
This album is a reflection of alot of hard work.
I try to be somewhat objective.
But this is a great follow-up.
The work shows and it pays off.
I think there might be one.
There is alot of heart here.
The album starts off "vintage" Coldplay.
Is there a word to describe this album or any other by Coldplay.
Moving.
But all and all I love Coldplay and I love this album.
Highlights include Fix You, Till Kingdom Come and What If.
It would be impossible to accomplish what they did there.
And ends on the highest note.

Does anyone know if it can be adjusted?
I managed to kick, drag the box out of the driveway but not into shelter.
Getting out of the zero gravity position actually stresses out my low back as I have to lunge forward with too much force.
It stayed in the rain for 24 hours or so until someone strong enough to bring it in.
One visitor was not able to get through as she was not strong enough to move the box.
It remained in the rain all night.
The shipping company ( can't remember which carrier) left the large box in the middle of the driveway by the gate, instead of bringing it in to the house, blocking access to my house.
The locks are off.
I have a bad back.
The LaFuma zero gravity chair was delivered.
Other wise it is good.
Hope it loosens up with use.
It rained.
It is very stiff, however, compared to my old Travel chair.
We unpacked it, and the chair did not seem to be damaged, so I am not returning it.
I also noticed that the box was damaged at one end.

The art is excellent, the story is great, and even the voice acting is decent.
Also, I never liked the ending.
After all, I was saving myself 50% of what VHS buyers were paying for.
And did I mention the price?
A fantasy tale told in thirteen chapters, all in two DVDs!
The chapter search is a great benefit, which allows you to go to your favorite scenes again.
I'm not a big anime fan.
In the end, this has become my favorite anime, period.
Let me tell you, I became engrossed.
OK.
Then I came across this DVD collection, and thought I'd give it a shot.
Akira and Ghost in the Shell, but that's it.
It was good, but for five hours I wanted something a little more.
I'll get down to the point.
The only minus I can think of is that it does appear to be just a transfer from VHS, so if you own the original set, don't bother with the DVD.

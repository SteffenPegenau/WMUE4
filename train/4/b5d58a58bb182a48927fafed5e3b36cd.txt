WHO GIVES A RAT'S ASS?
turn them both to max, play the lowest key on the bass, and scream as loud as you can.
WHOOPDIDOO!!
I really enjoy their rap/alt style, and simple though their lyrics may be, they are quite enjoyable.
And what's all this obsession about hardcoreness?
YES, some of their chords and techniques are simple.
SHUT THE F**K UP!
The point of music is to be GOOD, not just HARD.
HARDCORE!
NO!Linkin park is not hardcore, but they are GOOD.
but GOOD???
And that's why this CD is so successful- because people didn't care whether or not it was unoriginal or not hardcore or stupid or simple- they just cared about it being good.
But ease off, people!It's still music.
This IS good music.
If you want hard, all you need to do is go outside with a cheap electric guitar and a karaoke machine.
NO, they are not the most original band out there.

Dark Shadows fans are many and true.
Now it isn't exactly like Dark Shadows either but it is a Dark Shadows I could like and even learn to love.
The trailer of this looked like it was a total spoof so I've avoided it like the plague.
All they succeeded in doing was warding off the die hard fans, like myself, until fate steps in and they see it as it really is.
I am a major Dark Shadows (original TV series) fan.
The dodos don't get it.
Not all, but, many.
Okay, I did NOT expect to like this one in the least.
I LOVE Johnny Depp and like a lot of Tim Burton's films.
A tribute to a beloved TV classic.
I bet the studio decided to package it that way in hopes of selling it as a comedy.
The trailer was a TERRIBLE depiction of the film.
This one totally blew my mind.
So if you've not given it a try do so, you may be pleasantly surprised!
It depicted it as an all out comedy which it really doesn't have much comedic elements when you watch the film.

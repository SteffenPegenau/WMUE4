When I first played it I was very confused, and spooked!
He sees Luigi and tells him to run, he'll follow.
Luigi's mansion is the greatest game I ever played!
He gets there, goes into the parlor and what does he see?
So now Luigi's job is to venture into the mansionand suck up ghosts and find Mario!
The old man gives Luigi a vacuum and tells Luigi to take it to suck up the ghosts.
So he sends Mario up to check it out, and Mario doesn't come back.
Also, an strange old man in a white coat chasing it!
He gives him a small explanation of how to use it and a demonstration.
A GHOST!
So Luigi goes to check the mansion.
See, Luigi won a mansion in a contest that he didn't even enter!
Very interesting, huh?
Hope this is helpful!
I'll tell you about it.
Then I got used to the game and now, I'm a professional ghost vacuumer!
They get to the old man's lab and go inside.

)Torgo (Mr nelson) makes his debut performance and only the fact that many other times will Torgo appear, only this allows you to watch this film.It is bad.
It was long and stupid.
It was long, stupid and quite pointless.Yes, I know that most MST3K movies are made with the hopes that Joel and "the bots" can salvage it.
In fact I have forgotten almost everything about this film.
But I thank Joel and the bots for getting me thru it.
And driving.
]I hate this movie.
But THIS film....well, it is beyond ALL hope.
And driving.
And then getting lost.
The opening scene goes on for what seems, 16 hours.
Except that it was long.
This is truly one of the WORST movies ever made!
I realize that there is a short before this film, but I have forgotten it.
It oozes badness.
(And what's up with the "kissing couple", is THIS their occupation?
It starts off like a college film class project, a family driving.
And THEN the film starts!!!

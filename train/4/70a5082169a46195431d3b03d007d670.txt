I just love them all.
And even though I'm in college and I read Freud and other thinkers, I still go to the bokstore and charge five Pike books at a time.
Wish there were more.
When I'm in a situation I'd think, what wouls Alisa(Sita) do (other than kill).
I totally bonded with her and her pain hurt me too.
The last book minght not be the best, but it was awesome.
thank you fo rreading.
I really do.
I love reading them on the train going to school.
Everyone else-enjoy!
I kept on looking for more pages, but...
The Last vampire series is one of my all time favorites.
When I read the 6th novel on the train, I was shocked with the ending.
The whole series took me about 3 years to read, even though I thoroughly enjoyed the books I didn't have much time for constant catching up.
I wish for an Oxford Dictionary size Sita novel.

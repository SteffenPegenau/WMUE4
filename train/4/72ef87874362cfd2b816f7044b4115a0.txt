I can't think of any better purchase for beginners.
So its an older game, so I didn't expect much, but I was surprised.
There are so many add on's at $20 or more.
There are at least 2-3 electric, diesel, and steam locomotives that you can drive.
So if you want more pay less for the game and more for the add on's.
I loved how you could just ride along as the game takes you along the route you have chosen.
The only exception I can really think of is price, new it may not be worth it, not paying $100 for it, buy it used if you can.
This is a good buy for sure.
The next feature I liked was the amount of actual trains you can choose from.
I was really impressed with the graphics that they offer.
It needs some work, but it is a game that is meant for windows 95.
Also, the amount of add on's and the price they possess.
This is why I recommend getting it used.
It gave me an idea as to how each engine is operated.
This is a good train simulator for a beginner engineer.

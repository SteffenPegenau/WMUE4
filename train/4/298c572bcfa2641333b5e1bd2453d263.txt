First of all, this not going to be a Ipod VS. Sansa review.
But, the sound quality is good, and I am pleased.
I would recommend this product.
I've owned my sansa since Christmas, so I guess I can right a fair review on it.
Anyway, I'd like to say this product is a bit buggy.
This is good for it's money, and will hold up a while.
Well, the picture is quite good, and it's not hard to use.
I've had 2 freezes with the thing already.
I do enjoy the fact it has the expansion slot, since if you become a music freak, it's okay.
It's probably a good investment, and I am yet to buy a case.
But, that happens with all mp3 players, I seem to hear anymore.
The computer reconizes it in a short period of time.
And, then WMP10 will be able to sync music on to it.
A thing about it is, that is scratches extremely easily, so I'd suggest getting a case with a screen cover.
They are two totally different products.

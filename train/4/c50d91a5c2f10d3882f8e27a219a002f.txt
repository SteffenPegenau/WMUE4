I can't wait to see if I can get the Britney Spears-Britney: The Videos the DVD.
I gave it 4 stars because some songs were just not there such as "I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman" I really don't like this song, but the Cinderella song on the album is good as well!
I hope she makes a new record as well.
Great Job Britney!
I love the cover and the back side.
Britney Spears is awesome.
My favorie tracks are:I'm A Slave 4 UOverprotectedBombastic LoveBoysTheir are some others.
I have heard all of them and I love them.
I got this cd wrapped up for my Christmas gift and I can't wait to open it.
Although I have saw it.
It has all the behind-the-scene footage and Bonus features.
All I can say is that this is A great album.
It's a new Britney.
Britney sure has grown over her albums.
This one is awesome compared to the others.
You're Growing Up TO Fast!

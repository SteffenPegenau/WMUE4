Buy it!
I think the Pythons designed this DVD case themselves as a joke.
I sat with the service person opening every single copy of the DVD only to find that all of them were scratched.
Wow-nice one DVD packing people.
For all you Python fans out there this is great.
There are two disks with one spindle.
There is but one snaffoo.
Lets put some more pride in our work!
The disks get scratched.
Everything from the chase the killer rabbit mode to the Japanese dubbed version to the subtitle for people who don't like the film, this DVD has it all.
Supposedly they both fit on the spindle, which is possible, but the problem is that the people who assemble these little DVD box sets are too lazy to put it on correctly.
Anyway the DVD itself is marvelous.
When I bought it at [We will soon be taking over the world and have a hobby of destroying the economies of small countries]mart mine was scratched so I took it back.
So what happens?
I got my new one and it was scratched.

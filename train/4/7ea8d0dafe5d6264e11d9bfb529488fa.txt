Now I know this doesn't amazing but it's fun while it lasts.
There is a trick to almost everything you do and fight.
The graphics are pretty good if the characters looked like that in the movie.
.
You battle people wolves and a multiple # of cave trolls and Orcs.
You get to be Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf(Gandalfs the best!).
Although I highly recommend the second game, The Lord Of the Rings The Two Towers, that's also fun.
It took me 2 days to beat it.
You can use magic with Gandalf, use a LONG sword and bows with Aragorn, and you can put on the Ring with Frodo.
.
NOTHING.
The game is a quick and challenging game.
But this is a game to rent.
The first thing that caught me about this game was the characters look NOTHING like they do in the movies.
So this is not the best game but it is fun.
You'll beat it too quickly.
This didn't really upset me too much though.

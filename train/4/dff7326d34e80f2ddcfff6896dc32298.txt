Should be wonderful.
The same with the last release of Wizard of Oz, which was also incredibly grainy.
It is too bad because I expected "That's Entertainment", in Blu-ray to be altogether better than the DVD collection.
That's Entertainment in Blu-Ray 1080p.
This is my fourth version.
But I will always love the content of "That's Entertainment."
Most BW clips are incredibley grainy.
(1984 Single TE Laserdisc,VHS, DVD) And the last.
Baloney.
The DVD version is actually better over-all.
In this day of Blu-Ray, there shouldn't be any distraction from the art, because of technical problems.
I therefore watch the 1999 release, which has a sharp, but not grainy picuture.
There are several audio drop-outs.
Should be sharp.But it actually is an immense dissapointment on Blu-Ray.
People have argued with me that it's because it is supposed to be there.

When I was introduced to metallica.
This is a song that represents everything about metal.
I remember it well.
The song "THE FOUR HORSEMAN" to this day is one of my top 3 favorites ever.
By the second time I heard the song, it was instantly my favorite song, passing up my appetite for destuction addiction.
I got the album "AND JUSTICE FOR ALL" and I was HOOKED.
Fear not on purchasing this album.
The riffs are excellent and the changes and solos throughout the song are brilliant.
The raw power of this album is undenialble.
It is a metal classic
I bought it.
My other favorites are "Jump in the fire, Pulling teeth, whiplash, no remores, and the CLASSIC SEEK AND DESTROY.
And listened to it WAY more then justice, even though I don't like some of the songs on it.
Shortly later, a friend of mine who knew much more of there material suggested I should next get KILL EM ALL.
I was 10/11 years old, back in 1989, watching headbangers ball and a band I never heard of had a video named one.

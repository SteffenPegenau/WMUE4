i decided that night to play some solitare on my pc.
i loved it.
i like this cd alot.
great vocals.
the kind of exotic whisper/singing in parts of it is a very nice toucha good cd to add to your collection.
nice and dancey.
the cd is 68:32 long so you get a nice length.
this is a cd that you need to lock yourself away and put it on and listen to the whole cd.
i got the feeling it had a touch of Mila Mar type of vocals in a few tracks.
the song "try to relate" could end up on radio i think.
the song "some girl" is already a single, and a great choice for one too.
when i first got it, i skimmed through each track and thought "this is a little different".
:-))
i put it on and listen to the entire cd.
and of course another great cd from the shelves of a different drum.
some of the songs are a slower more deep songs, while others have a nice dance feel to them.

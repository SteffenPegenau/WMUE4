Sure.
Sometimes Frank didn't sing all the notes on the page (and Bing always did) But Frank had his own style.
THIS IS POP MUSIC.
Nothing more or less.
Andrea Bocelli is pretty good.
SO, should you buy this album?
As long as you are not expecting "AIDA" you'll be happy with it.
But we are not talking about Verdi here.
He's flat sometimes, sure.
The rest of the album is Italian Pop Pap.
Well Andrea sometimes doesn't get it all right, but what he does get right is...well...sometimes sublime (well as far as Con Te Partiro is concerned).
I purchased this CD and, from an operatic point of view, was disappointed.
Also, I thought it was funny that Sarah Brightman was jumping on the Bocelli train.
Some of his songs are pretty good.
Bocelli doesn't hit all the notes.
Comparing Bocelli to any of the 3 tenors is like comparing Sinatra to Bing Crosby.

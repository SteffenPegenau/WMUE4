I mean... REALLY GOOD addition !
This has space and funk.
I own this on vinyl.
Mwandiishi and Sextant had space.
It is sooooo intense, psychadelic and FIRM !!!
I own the CD release, now, and it sounds fine.
I'm still waiting>P.S.
In the 70's Hancock was a king.
It wasn't ever "more Herbie".
!
This "Headhunters" band was of a particular mythology.
It is an ABSOLUTE TRIP !!!
Headhunters and Thrust had funk.
It was seriously KICKIN "first generation" fusion, standing on it's own, at it's best then.
Excellent addition to the "Mwandishi" period!!!
I swear, when I was in high school in the late 70's (sucking up whatever US releases of Miles I could find) this album scared me!
This is something!

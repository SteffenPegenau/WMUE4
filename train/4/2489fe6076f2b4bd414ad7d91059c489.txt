9/10Elimination Chamber for the Heavyweight TitleRandy Orton vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Batista vs.
This is why you want this DVD.
Triple H-Spectacular match.
Even though Taboo Tuesday was better this still was a great match.
Edge vs.
5/10Kane vs. Gene Snitsky-Great match with a lot of cool moves between this two monsters.
Second best of the night.
Sort of entertaining.
Very slow paced because Lawler stinks as a wrestler.
3/10IC TitleBenjamin vs. Maven-Worse than I expected, Maven didn't even fight, and there was a lot of trash talking.
6.5/10Jerry Lawler vs. Muhammad Hassan-Snoser.
Second best Elimination Chamber.
6/10Women's Title MatchTrish vs. Lita-I don't like women matches because as always, the stink.
10/10
Survivor Series was better.
World Tag Title matchChristian & Tomko vs. Regal and Eugene-A decent opener, nothing special, just a regular match.
Put Muhammad in better matches, he has potential.
Cool moves, Batista and Triple H rock.

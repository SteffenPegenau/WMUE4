4 stars here because it could have and should have been harder guitar wise.By the way, buy Wicked Sensation immediately if you have not heard it!!!!
After Wicked Sensation George made some so so albums with 2-3 good songs.
Please stay together and make the next album harder.
This effort is much better.
Rock-n-roll hasn't been the same to me since grunge music took over many years ago.
(Glad that has changed).
What I mean is most cd's have 2-3 good songs tops.
This is easily the best rock cd I've heard in probably ten years.
This cd has one or two bad songs and that's it.
Honestly speaking this is solely because George Lynch is incredible.
However, he does a great job and perhaps in the 80's the name Dokken should have been Pilson.
When I heard Jeff Pilson was singing on this album I wasn't ready to run buy it.
!
Thanks to Pilson and Lynch for the music.
I loved Dokken and Lynch Mob(Wicked Sensation).
Maybe it's not that this cd is that good but most music has been bad.

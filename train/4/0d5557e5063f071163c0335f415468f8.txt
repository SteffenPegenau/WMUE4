Putting this thing together took me less than 1hr.
After 7 months of use, just a little fade on the steering wheel leg support.
Seat is confortable, played 12hrs straight no problem.
Mounted the steering wheel and pedals, I was ready to go.
Overall this is a good racing seat but with some flaws.
I agree with the other reviews about the bar between your legs getting in the way.
Checkout my video on youtube and search 989surfer.
Beats using a controller.
After putting it together, it felt solid.
My video has the playseat mounted on a custom chassis and tv stand.
Also the angle of the pedal mount is a bit steep, I prefer less angle.
Fit and finish is nice.
With some customization, this can be the best racing seat.
Bought the shifter holder and the slider.
No tripping or stumbling on exposed wires.
The racing seat makes racing games more fun.
I will be making a custom wheel holder, bar less between legs.

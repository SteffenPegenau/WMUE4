I am allergic to dust.
That is, not until I purchased the Homeywell 50250.
My wife and I couldn't be happier.
The pain never completely went away.

We just moved into a newly remodeled house.
If you have allergies, or if you don't, breath better, remove smells, and clear the air with this fantastic tool.
It was an easy out-of-box install that only took a few minutes.
Consequently, I have been suffering from it.
Some headaches were so bad that I became nauseated and had to go to bed.
My remodeling included some sheet-rock repairs and the resulting dust.
You can't go wrong.
By day two, my headaches disappeared.
We ran it on full power for a few days.

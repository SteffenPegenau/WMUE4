This is a very good early VeggieTales.
It's just no Silly Song.This is a very good lesson for kids.
That isn't mentioned in the video, but I also think it is an oversight.
Big Idea is trying to get the general message across, which they do very well.
I would note only one thing.
When someone asks for forgiveness, give it to them.
They do 2 segments instead of one larger segment.
They didn't quite hit their peak yet with this one.
The parents need to be around to make sure the message in their head doesn't become one of cheap grace.
But, as I said, this is more of a note than a critique.
In between there is no song, but the Forgive-o-matic section is still good.
We don't want our kids coming up to us asking forgiveness when all they really want is to get out of trouble and they genuinely aren't sorry.
However, I have to keep in mind that it is geared towards kids.
A person who is truly sorry will do more than say he or she is sorry.
I highly recommend the video.

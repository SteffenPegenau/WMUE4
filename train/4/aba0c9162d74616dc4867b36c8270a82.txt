I rated this movie as high as I did because of what it is.
Well they replaced the T & A with cars in this movie.
T & A, right?
This movie changed some of my views.
Your proverbial "naked women" have been replaced with a lot of really nice (expensive) cars.
Why do we watch "B" movies?
The plot is simple to follow.
Granted, the acting left something to be desired.
I am not into the Japanese four banger hot rods.
It was bearable, however.
It is a great "B" movie.
This was an ideal example of a "B" movie, right down to the Cheesy on liners ('I live my of a quarter of a mile at a time').
I am an American Muscle Car fanatic.
The cars in the movie are just plain pretty (especially the one and only Muscle Car, a blown 1968-69 Dodge Charger).
I had no idea the kind of power these cars could produce.

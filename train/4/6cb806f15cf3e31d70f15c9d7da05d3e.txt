I didn't care that the dino never seemed to get "full".
You pretty much know who's going to survive until the end.
There is alot of carnage, and I mean ALOT.
This dino eats everything in sight.
But I was not disappointed in this book.
Whether the author did research on the subject at hand, I could really care less.
It's easy reading and I found it be a page turner.
He's intelligent, works things out.
I didn't find this book scary just gory.
It reads like a horror movie, this isn't a bad thing.
The whole point is to just be a good story.
I don't read for facts, not a fiction novel.
If you are looking for a gory, quick, dino horror novel, this is for you.
The dino is relentless too, just like a horror movie where the bad guy just never seems to die once.
This wasn't a excellent book in the sense of I'll ever read it again.

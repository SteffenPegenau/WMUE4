However, I cannot give the DVD five stars as it really skimps on the extras(You know, the ones that make a DVD really worth buying?).
If you like your humor black as night with some corniness sprinkled in, this show is probably for you.
Seventeen and a half hours worth of entertainment is a decent value.
It should have been called Law and Order: Pure Comedy Gold.
Then again, at less than fifty bucks for a season of an hourlong show, it's not too shabby.
What a great series.
So in conclusion, if you are one warped little monkey, this show is probably for you.
Why?
And thus, SVU was born.
Two words: comdeic genius.
The first season rules because it plays up the comedy more than the later ones thus far, with both amusing plots and dialogue.
Or if you think that because they're sex crimes they're "hard hitting and shocking"...whatever.
Sex crimes are funny.
Maybe I'm missing the point.
SVU is a pretty sweet show.
Dick Wolf knows this.

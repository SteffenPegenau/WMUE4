Looking forward to Kanye West College Dropout.
The greats always leave on a high note.
More mature, "grown man" hip hop.
Awesome production.
**pick up Little Brother, Listening** Rick Rubin is foolish with 99 Problems.
Another platinum plaque to hang, Congrats to S. Carter.
First off, Im no MC, to criticize would be crazy simply because im not a lyricist/rapper.
Always have felt Jay-Z.
One of the best, lyrically.
Just my thoughts on Jay-Z's The Black Album.
Nice to see 9th Wonder getting his.
Holla at Birmingham 1 last time my buddy.
With no exeption for this man.
Some traces of the hunger heard in Reasonable Doubt (5 star classic album).
And with that said....Its hard to believe that Jay-Z is gonna stay away from the game forever.
Breathe and Live Long.
Really diggin Justify My Thug, long live DJ Quik (Quik is the Name).
205
Best wishes with the rest of his life.

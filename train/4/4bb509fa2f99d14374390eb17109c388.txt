It can get very frusterating at times.
I hade so much trouble turning, accelerating, ect.
It just takes a little while to get used to everything, like the controls!
I recomend it to anyone who has a nintendo64!
Especialy when you are trying to win races in the Season Mode.But don't get me wrong.
It is a great game!
But after I tried and tried, I got a little better each time.
The Exibition Mode is also very fun!
So this is a really fun game!
if you win certain races in the Season Mode, hidden tracks will appear in Special Tracks.
The Special Tracks that you can go on in the main menu Are also really fun!
Thanks!
race against your friends and see who is the best!
The first time you play Excitebike64, you won't find as fun as you thought it would be.
The sound is a great feature of this game.
Its really sound like racing dirtbike!
It is a very fun game.

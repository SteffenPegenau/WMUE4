Psychic.
They spend the majority of the movie building the suspense of what is coming after them, however with the title of "The Crawling Eye" the suspense is muted to the first time viewer.
Forest Tucker and others lend better acting then often seen in these movies.
They get it right most of the way through by building dread about what is coming down the mountain in the cloud.
You know what is coming.
Decapitations.
They should have stuck with the Trollenberg Terror as the name.
I'm not even going to cite them for the appearance of the monster as some do.
It was the 50s.
My only beef about the movie is the americanized title (and the DVD cover).
Mind control.
A very good 50's sci fi entry.
What do you expect?
What more could you want?
Dead men rising to kill.
It was made on a shoestring budget.

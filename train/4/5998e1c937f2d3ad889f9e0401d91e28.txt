If you like Everquest, I think you will like this game too.
!!!
I wasn't a PKer but it did make the game more intense.
... but that does just add to the fun.
I do wish there was more variety in facial features and hair color.
Maybe this will be added after beta.
I literally only saw a few minor bugs in the beta but it is lacking in some niceties that most mmorpgs have such as being able to easily find your friends (no /who command) and no autorun.
Even the orcs look good.
I happen to like the pvp aspect of the game.
The graphics blow everything else out of the water.
The classes look fantastic.
You had to be stealthy when you were hunting and watch out for raiding PK hunting parties.
I've been playing the closed beta now for 3 weeks.
Give it a try if you like this genre.
Its a fun game.
The female characters are very scantily clad ...
There is a nice economic system which was easy to use, banking, and players can autosell while afk as in Final Fantasy XI.

The 'chicklet' keys are great.
I'm tempted to point out the number of people who have had problems with this phone also mention how they were on their 2nd, 3rd and 4th Treo.
Don't buy it.
No problem there.
The syncing to Outlook is PERFECT.
Other then that, I love it.
Plus, and I hope I am wrong, I don't think you can upgrade to newer versions of the PPC O/S.
I can't.
Can anybody really type without a keyboard?
Yes, the phone is big, but its actually usable in place of a laptop.
But buying it, and then bellyaching about how its too big seems like... well, I just don't get it.
I like everything about the phone except the plastic shell, which seems lame.
This thing lets me get company email, personal email, and it opens most attachments.
Can't really say that about most PDA-phone.
Maybe not everybody is a 'big' PDA-Phone person.

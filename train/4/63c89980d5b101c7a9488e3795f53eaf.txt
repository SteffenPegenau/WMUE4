Another thing I don't like is it always skips in the middle of songs.
In the end this is a great mp3 player.
I didn't have to read the directions because it's so simple to use.
BEWARE: IF YOU GET ONE BE PREPARED TO SHARE!!!
Something I do like is the accesories.
(speaking of perfect please excuse my spelling in this review)
I like the fact that you can record things, but it's hard to understand yourself.
I would definately recommend getting some.
( of course I'm only eleven so...) Anyways the earphones hurt my ears and often fall out.
It comes with a belt clip and an armband.
My mom uses it too.
I also recieved rechargable batteries which are a life saver.
I recieved this mp3 player for x-mas.
It is hard for me to plug it to the thing in the computer.
I don't use these but my dad often borrows it and he finds them useful.
It comes with a couple minor glitches but nothings perfect.

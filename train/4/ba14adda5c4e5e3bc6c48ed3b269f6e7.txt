The drill really "works" and has a couple bits that fit the various nuts and bolts that hold the crane together.
(I think more for me than them, like I said we've been able to fudge it.)
Within about half an hour of getting this home we somehow lost a couple bolts and it wasn't like we were in a frenzy.
The concept is great.
It's easy for little hands to work.
We have been able to fudge it, and it's still very fun, but it's not the same and very frustrating to not be able to complete it.
I wish it came with extra bolts.
You know, like how real mechanics always have spare parts.
;-)
But it is very easy to lose the pieces.
It hasn't fit together perfectly since.
That's the downside.
We love this toy.
It doesn't sound like a lot when you read the box but 34 pieces is A LOT for this kind of toy and EVERY ONE is important.
We were very organized in our play but I do have a 4 year old and a 2 year old so you can only be so organized.

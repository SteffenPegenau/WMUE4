How to make nice things and keep your fingers too.
There are many other sections in this book.
Not just feed direction and goggles but reed rate, speed, consequences, explanations.
Especially in a table.
How to properly use and how not to use.
After a good history lesson in router design your get the low down on bit design and purpose.
"If you ever wondered why the no name bits are so cheap" this book will tell you everything about it.

In my opinion the router is one of the most dangerous tools in the shop.

is fun, and their (original) version of Brother Louie is definitely worth hearing.For a collection focused just on Hot Chocolate's 1970s stuff, check out "Best of the 70's - Hot Chocolate".Note: the amazon listing of this disc leaves off the last 8 tracks.
IMHO, this is the best collection of Hot Chocolate tracks.
They are:12.
Don't Stop It Now16.
I Believe (In Love)19.
Standouts are You Sexy Thing, Every 1's A Winner, It Started With A Kiss, Girl Crazy, and Emma.
What Kinda Boy You Looking For (Girl)18.
Disco Queen15.
Even the sad songs have catchy melodies and great rhythms!
A Child's Prayer17.
No Doubt About It (about a UFO visit!)
I Gave You My Heart (Didn't I)13.
Are You Getting Enough Happiness
I give it 4 stars because there is a bit of filler, but it's highly enjoyable.
You could Have Been a Lady14.

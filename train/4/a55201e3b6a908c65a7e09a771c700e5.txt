So Sara goes to look for him.
Her brother's name is Charlie.
Will Sara find Charlie?

I would pick this book as one of my favorites.
When he was little he had a high fever and since then he has not talked or laughed.
Instead he gets lost in the forest.
It's about a girl named Sara who lives with her Aunt Willie, sister and brother.
It makes you want to read more when you stop reading.

You don't want slop from fans but need a real objective view point.Here goes.
Her voice is especially fine tuned on LIVE, which is possibly the best song on here.
But there are enough highs and new artistry in here to keep you engaged and listening.
It's not all slop.
This I wasn't prepared for.
'Then you look at me' is probably my favorite.
I thought i was listening to Aerosmith in their better days.
'beauty and the beast and 'because you loved me probably shouldn't be included.
I bought the c.d.
you need some recommendations that are fair and unbiased.
Ok so you came here to buy a christmas gift.
to hear what it had to offer.
Her phrasing and intonation is well-defined.
I'm not a Celine Dion fan.
Who would have thought.
She does have a rock 'n roll voice.
Other experimentations are 'I want you to need me'... dont let the title fool you.
epic sounding and triumphant, there are some words in here that gave me chills when she said it, and joys all at once.

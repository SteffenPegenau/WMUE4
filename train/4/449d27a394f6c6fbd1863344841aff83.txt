the 8.5" x 11" digital book style item is supremely over priced.
when is IO3?
the pen itself is a bit fat, but easily used.
all things considered, i like it and recommend it.
at this time, the A5 tablets seem best buy.
unless you know, i say get IO2.
faithfully captures all that is written on digital paper (required), looks like a scanned image.
you will have to decide which digital paper to buy.
this review is probably a bit premature.
with simple encode, will convert image to text into a ms one note or ms word doc.
finally, this IO2 from all i can find out is a leap over IO1.
it's not perfect, but then neither is my printing.
have only used it for 6 or 8 sheets of paper.
with a paper cutter and punch, pages fit nicely in a half size (5" x 8")'day timer' type loose leaf binder.
other conversions are available, limited recognition of indented outlining.
fair to good.

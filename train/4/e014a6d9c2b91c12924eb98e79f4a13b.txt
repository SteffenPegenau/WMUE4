I picked this one by its cover.
You have to like the main character's ambition and humor.
But if you have some free time and would like an easy read, this book is very enjoyable.
But alas I've been beat to to the punch.I love books and I am always happy to see a new author come on the scene.
The only thing I thought this book lacked was personal or spiritual growth from the main character.
This book came out so recently that I came on here to write a review thinking I would be the first.
But it turned out to be a good call.
So when you think you know what is going on, you don't.
Not that all good books need that -- I just prefer it in books I read.This one took me about a weekend to read and I think it was well worth the time.
No.
I did.
I like that.
A deeply moving book that will make you cry, laugh and sing?
And the book is not so cut and dry as you would think.
Haha yeah I know you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

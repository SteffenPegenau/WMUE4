King Arthur has always been one of my favorite collection of stories.
You know there is some movie scores that annoy me or depress me, but this one made me want to fall on my knees and cry.
But, other than that, it was a wonderful show.
That was Arthur's right hand man.
So, when it came out it was all I could talk about for a few days.
If you haven't seen this one I strongly recommend it!
I will admit that this wasn't what I expected.
However, Lancelot's character disappointed me very much.
Beautifully done!
And then he died.
It is worth the money!
It's the reason I loved Gladiator so much.
Great music, great characters, great story, who could ask for more!
All the characters did a great job at bringing the story to life.
He was not supposed to oppose Arthur's decision nor criticize his religion.

After listening, I was a bit surprised...the girl has grown up, matured, but has managed to keep her signature sound.
You can still hear some of the early Bonham influences here, but they are refined and polished.
Shine has the best chorus of any song.Bottom Line: TB fans, this is a must buy.
Finally a new TB release.
What a pleasing opener.
Thanks for the music, Tracy!
Shine is my second favorite on the disc.
Eyes has a very catchy melody and is a well done near-ballad.
Great vocals, great guitar, great everything.
A fun tune with fun lyrics.
I love the inspirational lyrics and smokin' melody.
HOOORAY!!
Dumbo Sun is awesome!
You won't be disappointed, in fact, probably very pleased with her mature sound.
For a little on my favorite tracks, read on:The opening track, Something Beautiful, is just that.

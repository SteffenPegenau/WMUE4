I hope it answers the question I have.
To me there are issues between many of the characters that need to be resolved.
From there it became a survival story on the planet.
Especially the Men vs. Women in society.
Personally, I got hooked into the book by the origin of the Angels.
The unresolved tensions kept me going through the book.
I know the next book is out already.
Which all in all isn't bad, but the ending left me wanting more.
It is also a good place to start if you are new to the series
Another fine book in the Saga of Recluce series.
It needed to be resolved for better or worse.
With the quirky references to some of the other stories, it was a fun read.
Unfortunately, that is the first chaper or three.
I was truely interested in their war against the deamons and in the structure of how their two societies were set up.
It is the story of the Angels and how they carved a niche on the Roof of the World.

On the negative side, few mistakes on accuracy I notice but nothing major.
Also, you only get one voice if you want street names spoken.
Third, description of the system was very accurate.
if you want the system to just tell you right left turns, you have the option of a few voices; but not many.
Item was ready to use right from the box.
Fits perfectly in a corner or in middle of windshield.
Overall high marks for a simply to use and extremely helpful gadget.
First, great price at amazon.
You can download additional voices for a price ofcourse!
I was worroed about the size being too small, however, my girlfriend convinced me to not buy the wode screen and she was right.
Suction bracket that is included is easy to use.
Second, quick service.
Battery life is good.
N need whatsoever for a wide screen.
Turn it on, push a few buttons, and your off!

This player rocks and it's stacked with features.
Very cool!
Crisp and clear.
I like the remote control.
Harman/Kardon speakers are my preferred choice.
Yes, the built-in speakers don't put out the greatest sound but there's a remedy for that: Just connect a pair of external speakers to one of the headphone jacks and Presto!
It's also small and lightweight making it very easy to travel with.
Toshiba has made a fan out of me.
The best thing about this Toshiba DVD player is the screen image quality.
I get great sound quality when listening from my headphones.
you have decent surround sound.
I like the dual headphone jacks.
I received this Toshiba Portable DVD Player as a Christmas gift from my wife.
In a word: Wow!
The only little draw back to this player is that I like to keep a spare battery available as a back up.
Other than that, this is a nice player for anyone to have and enjoy.

At first I thought this DVD was a ripoff (3 screen washers and various "calibrators").
After running the various WASHERS on Pixel Protector, much of the plasma ghosting was gone.
I think patience is the key with this product....I first used a software called JScreen Fix (as the 50" display is my pc monitor too!)
Let it run for the 6 to 7 hours, then try the other washers (2 & 3).
Not sure.
This monitor was over 7 grand, so I must say I FREAKED OUT when there was a tiny red blinking star on the screen!
My eye went right to it EVERY time.
Would it have gone away on its own?
This did not work on its own.
But it is gone now!
I bought this because I had a "stuck pixel" on my somewhat older Pioneer Plasma monitor model 5030 HD.
After a few times, the stuck pixel was gone too.
Don't try to use this for a 1/2 hour and say it didn't work.
Patience is the key.
I did see an improventment and the red dot is thankfully gone!

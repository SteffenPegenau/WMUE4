Hope this helps.
The one thing I can say about the bad reviews is that they actually helped me.
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
It was only about 15 minutes and it is working beautifully.
She is nine years old which is a perfect age for this product.
Other than that, we love it.
You have to speak the password exactly the same each time for the password to work.
My daughter is having a great time with it.
Very important though, make sure you have NEW batteries for best performance.
The only problem that we have is that it doesn't always recognize your voice.
I almost didn't get it because it had so many bad reviews.
However, it did NOT take us hours to program it.
I had no grand expectations of this product.
I knew that I had to be patient with it.
I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.

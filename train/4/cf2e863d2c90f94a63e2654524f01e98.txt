Smooth operation.
About the only complaint I have is the no mar tip is easy to lose.
I expected a little more from a nailer that says Senco in little letters on the side.
It is muffled and gradually exits the tool at the back of the handle.
Very quiet.
But neither is anything else.
It's not adjustable.
It beats the other imports hands down.
Depth of drive is easily adjustable .
I know it's not a true Senco but I guess it's the closest thing.
I've had several brad nailers and this is my second favorite.
Plenty of power.
I wish all guns implemented this improvement.I also like the rather large rubber grip.
No more blowing dust around the room or worse in your eyes!
I love the exhaust.
Oh and it's not as refined as a Senco.
It doesn't have to be.

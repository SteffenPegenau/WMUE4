Shaakir's style is like no other.
His love for the music is felt throughout the CD.
It's the bomb!
For those who smooth sax playing with great bass grooves, or music to chill with that special someone, then this is a MUST HAVE.
Don't sleep on this one.
I especially like the cut "For Old Times Sake Part 2."
This brother is smooth.
The guy is real and so is his music.
This is the second of five CD's he has recorded.
Check this CD out.
This guy is going places.
Look out for his next CD to hit in 2004.
I recently had the privilege to meet Shaakir a few weeks ago.

You'll regret it.

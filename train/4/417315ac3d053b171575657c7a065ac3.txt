This is better than Goodfellas by a wide margin.
I also mean that it's a great picture due to the fact that it's on HD-DVD.
The picture is astonishingly vivid and clear and the lights of Las Vegas really jump out of the television.
There is the obligitory commentary, deleted scenes, and a couple featurettes.
Note: I have the HD DVD drive attached to my Xbox 360 and it works brilliantly !
I mean that statement in two ways.
All of the regulars give awesome performances in this (even Sharon Stone, who I can't stand!).
This and Batman Begins are the reasons you should own an HD DVD player !
That's the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.
First, in my humble opinion, this is Martin Scorcese at his finest.
I do like that you can watch the extras and the movie at the same time with commentary running.
The extras are ample, but I'd say adequate.
It's all whipped cream and a cherry on top of an excellent sundae !
It's almost 3-D !
If you like mafia pictures, this is the BEST one to own.

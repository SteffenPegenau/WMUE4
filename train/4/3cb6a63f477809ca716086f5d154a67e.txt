There are way better mp3 players with way more memory!"
If you want to hear new stuff, how long does it take to add and delete songs?
The math for the prices is not linear.
Just a thought, Apple.
I have over 4,000 songs on my computer, and this thing works just fine.
The only thing that I see as a problem is the price.
Let's face it.
I don't think anyone needs more than 2 GB of data.
Who listens to 250 songs a day, even a week?
The 20GB should cost 10 times that of the Nano since its hard drive is 10 times bigger, or better yet the Nano should cost a tenth of the 20GB, making it about $30.
This thing holds 2 GB of data.
Yeah, changing songs every day can be a hassle, but there's no need to go any higher.
You could buy the 20GB Photo for only a hundred more dollars.
This equals about 250 songs.
"What only 250?

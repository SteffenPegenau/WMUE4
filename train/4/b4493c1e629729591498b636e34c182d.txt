I even didn't know them.
Gianluigi Trovesi (clarinets) and Gianni Coscia (accordion) play into your mood.
I treat it like a tribute to various people, tribute to country or to place where you listen to this.
I enjoyed it really a lot.
Try to liste to "Minor Dance": there is gypsy music, there is also bit of tango ("...til they sore").
Trovesi instruments reminds me Jan Garbarek sound.
Whatever.
You will too.
After knowing Paolo Conte, La Banda (Italian brass band), Piccola Orchestra Avion Travel I started to be curious about their music.
If you like sunrise mornings in the mountain, you should listen this soundtrack.
Or very much.
Go ahead and take Django (you know him)and you're gonna get unspecific swing.
It really seems like you know all those melodies included on the album.
I was caught up on Italian names.
Coscia accordion will take you to Paris(?).
I did not hear them before.
If you like empty night streets, you should listen this soundtrack walking around.

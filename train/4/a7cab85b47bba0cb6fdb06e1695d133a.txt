The book didn't set in just one story.
In his stories he explains the tourmit of how bad it was in war.
Some people would tell how they felt in the war.
The war has left him with many different conflicts.
He explains the evil of war but also the good of war.
I really enjoyed this book,
But many different stories.
Having a best friend and watching them die the very next day.
His stories never made one point but many point of views.
This was a great book witch I enjoyed very much.Some parts of the book has a very unique message.
Of the war in vietnam andhow he feltabout it.
How a real human being feels.
This book had many different stories.
The author just told the truth but not the whole truth.
How war was hell for all of them.
It brings back the innocent of man kind.
He showed the reader many views of other people in the in the war.
These stories were truth for all of us.
You can't tell a good story with out fixing the truth as the author says.

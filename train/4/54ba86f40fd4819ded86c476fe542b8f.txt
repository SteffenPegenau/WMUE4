I used it instead and I felt a major difference.
I get really dark spots left from the acne.
I didn't get red but I didn see the white spots that others spoke about.
I used the neutralizer and my skin was so smooth.
I have moderate acne and I get big scars easily.
I didn't really see any results.
I also noticed that I only had a shinny nose where my entire face is usually oily.
I tried again the following Tuesday and I had received my brush that I ordered.
The first time I used a cotton ball and it was very little burning so I left it on for 10 minutes.
I just received my bottle Friday and tried it two times.
I think if I keep using it twice a week, I will see more results and the bumps will completely clear.
I was able to distract myself for 10 minutes.
I'm satisfied.
It began burning immediately.
I'm a black woman with tan/brown skin.
I will change my rating to a 5 if I'm able to use Amby on my dark spots without reoccuring break outs.

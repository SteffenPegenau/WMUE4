You don't have to use 50 zillion keys to run it--in fact, I used my touch pad and about 8 keys with no problems.
I worried as some people mentioned frame rate problems and such.
Some sophomoric humor, but a solid game.Is it Halo?
For that price, I'll pass it on to a friend and let him enjoy it, too.YMMV.
I ordered this game because I wanted something new and you can't beat an 8 buck price tag.
No.
No, probably not.
Is it worth 8 bucks?
It plays pretty seamlessly.Overall, the game is solid.
Some of the cut scenes are a bit long and you keep doing the same thing over and over--eating brains--but it is a nice game to turn off your mind and just enjoy.
No.
Is it fun?
Is it Medal of Honor?
Yes.
No problems here with a first generation Macbook Pro and 10.4.
Will I replay it?
Yes.

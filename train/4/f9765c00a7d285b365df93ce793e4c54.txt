You won't be disappointed!
Go and buy this album now!
But "Zooma" is something completely different!
I heard him saying that he already has some ideas about his second album.
OK, Robert Plant's "Manic Nirvana" and Jimmy Page's "Coverdale/Page" album were cool enough too.
But I'm sure that anything Mr. Jones will produce will sound great because he knows what he is doing!
It's so POWERFUL and HEAVY!
I thought it had to be soft music, kinda Jon Lord's "Pictured Within".
This album is obviously better than anything Plant or Page have done in past 10 years.
When I bought this LP I didn't expect this kind of music, to be honest.
Actually, it deserves 4.5 stars - this record is very close to a masterpiece.
Let's hope Mr. Jones will continue his solo career as it seems to be successful.
Personally I'd like to hear more keyboards and stuff like "Snake Eyes".
And I was so surprised after hearing "Zooma" for the first time!
And for those who still hesitate... well, don't!

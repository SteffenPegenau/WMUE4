Also doesn't get as hot as the HP.
The material use is much better quality than the Dell,or HP.
Much more durable than the Dell.
I've dropped my ThinkPad many times and no cracks or anything.
The screen is very plush and worth the money.
The touchpad, the reconizable red pointer, and scroll button are so convenient.
The T43 is an awesome machine.
In my other reviews I can't say enough good things about the IBM ThinkPad.
I've used Dell,HP,Gateway,Compaq,Sony and pretty much every kind there is, but I've always had a love for the ThinkPad.
Very tough and smooth.
You pay for quality.
T43 is worth the price.
My old Dell on the other hand is a different story.
No issues with this at all.
But that can be changed.
The only down side is that it runs Windows.

The down-side: Programming can be copmplicated.
Watch TV button turns the set on, to the correct input, turns on the cable box, turns on the stereo and sets to the proper input.
Very versitile.
But, great telephone support through your computer account.
Has the capability to integrate multiple functions into a single button command.
I have only done lights and fan so far.
Still, not complete though.
Features individual control as well as "theme configurations such as "all off" or "family room all on."
I suspect the device database gets updated as new medels come out.
Lighting control is so cool.
Z-wave devices (to control with this remote) are not cheap...but they work great.
Database lacks some, less-common, devices.
The same for DVD, Roku, and other sets of devices.
Overall, a very good remote...better than good when you consider the price and capabilities versus other, more expensive models.
You can control lights, garage door, fans, door locks, thermostat, etc.

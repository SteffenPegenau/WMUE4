However, I'm not sure I approve of the way the division was done.
More of the Seven Kingdoms to enjoy!
For the past week, I have lived in the Seven Kingdoms.
I understand the dilemma.
I have been waiting with bated breath for this book for years, and my only disappointment, as I have mentioned, is with the editing decision to remove several characters until the next book.
Hooray!
When I was reading, I was scolding myself to read slower, and make it last.
How much ground are we going to be rehashing in the next volume by going back in time to cover events being experienced by the characters not seen in this book?That aside, I have to say how much I love this series.
That's a dilemma I can appreciate.
When I was not actively reading, I was wishing I was reading.
Several of my favorite characters, I might add.
MARTIN - PLEASE WRITE FASTER!!
I need more!MR.
The book is just too big to publish in a single volume.

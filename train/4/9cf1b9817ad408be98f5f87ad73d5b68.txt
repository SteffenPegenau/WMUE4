is great.
It is also a very sad and emotional song.
It's about him being abused as a child.
to anyone who likes heavy metal or even alternative music!
!
The music on here is also great!
Such as the last song "Daddy".
He doesn't beat around the bush or use a bunch of that metaphoric stuff that the so-called "great lyricists" use.
Anyway, this c.d.
If he wants to say "f**k you", he'll say "f**k you".
I love this c.d.!
He expesses just how he feels.
Very heavy, very cool.
And to all of you people who think that Jonathan Davis is just acting on here, he is not.
All the stuff he sings and screams about on here actually happened.
The only reason I gave it four stars is because I don't like the song "Predictable", so I couldn't give it five stars.
I can't wait until their new c.d.
I love it how Jonathan Davis gets right to the point with his lyrics.
comes out on Novemeber 16!
I highly recommend this c.d.

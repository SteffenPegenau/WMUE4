etc is nice.5.
good combo with the psp.
the pelican carrying case that holds the psp, games, buds, charger.
case for the psp3.
usb a-b cord to transfer files to and from the psp.the pelican starter pack is great since it has most of the things you need to start off.
1gb recommended if you can find it.6.
like those pda screen protectors2.
My hands are medium sized( relative to work out glove medium) It is somewhat difficult to race using the analog stick and the shoulder buttons.
So I would say that anyone with small hands would have a difficult time using the psp and thats not taking into the consideration the weight of the unit.
a bigger mem stick, if you plan just to save games, 128-256 is fine.
if you want to put movies and mp3s, 512-1gb.
The PSP has an excellent screen.
case coverings for the umd games you buy4.
First couple things you need to buy when you buy the psp is:1. screen protector.
It is heavier than other handhelds.

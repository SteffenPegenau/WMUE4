"Punch it Chewie!
This game is not perfect but it is loads of fun.
The graphics are excellent and so is the gameplay.
Good luck and happy hunting.
in the "compatibility mode" box make sure the box is checked and choose Windows 98/ME.6.
select the "compatibility" tab.5.
My computer runs on Windows XP and I had the same problems when I first ran the program.
Unfortunately I had to randomly try things since there is no longer support for DS9: DW.
select properties.4.
However, I will get to the point regarding the glitchy mouse control.
"...oh wait, that's Star Wars.That worked perfectly for me.
Don't bother getting patches 1.05 or whatever some people here have been suggesting.
right click on the icon.3.
Oh well, such is life.
The solution:1. go to the Dominion Wars shortcut.2.
hit OK.7.

Gold Fever would make an excellent movie, and I imagine Vatican Gold will as well.
How about: Hollywood Gold?
Gold Fever is a thin read (296 pages), that is fat on details.
Welcome to Hollywood, Dr. Ellison!
I hope this leads to a trilogy.
Stern is just now releasing his latest book: Vatican Gold.
I cannot wait for the Dr. Stern gold series to hit the big screen!
Lots of details about the jungle rebels, etc.Dr.
This book is based on the real-world experiences of author Dr. Tom K. Stern.
The names may have been changed to protect the innocent.
It is Dr. Sterns Phillipine adventure lived through the eyes of his fictional re-incarnation: Dr. Todd Ellison.
It is a tall and engrossing tale.
I gave the book (Gold Fever) 4-stars because it was too short!
It has been said that truth is stranger than fiction.
The more outlandish the scenario, the more likely it really happened just as it is written.

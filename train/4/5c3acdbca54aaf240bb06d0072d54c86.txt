This set is HUGE.
The setup was super easy.
We plan to move it to their playroom as soon as we do some rearranging in there.
They love it!
They are 1 and 2.
Also, I plan to take some parts of this unit when we travel this summer.
It just pops right back.
Great buy.
I was not so excited about the price but the good reviews on Amazon convinced me to purchase it for my boys.
Make sure you have space in your home for something like this.
I wished I would have discovered this sooner.
We put it between our two sofas in the living room for now.
This would have really helped out during our snow days and just really cold days when we just didn't leave the house.
If you don't have a room big enough for the entire play hut then it can easily be setup into two smaller units that are still fun.
The boys have knocked it down playing rough inside the hut.

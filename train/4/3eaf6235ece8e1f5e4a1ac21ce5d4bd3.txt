All over the top of the page.
BUY IT!!!
Even if nothing but physical appearance changed i'd still buy it.
No problem.
Questions kept flashing through my mind.
Poor light?
It was there.
No more.
Hey, you've got 10-18 hours of continuous play, so do you REALY care anymore?
Battery runs out?
I was surfing around Nintendo looking for stuff from Golden Sun 2.
It's just that good.
Choped up screen?
I said to myself, "Why not check the GBA page while i'm at it?".
What did they improve?
NO!!!

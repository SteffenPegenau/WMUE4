UNBELIEVABLE!
TWO: There is NO LIGHT that comes on when the oven door is open!
However, the features far outweigh the deficiencies and I'd buy it over again even if I DID know of these two problems.
It is a 1,300 watt unit and shows it!
There is no way I could have known this befor purchase since this oven was not available in my city.
ONE: When opening and closing the door the oven sounds like a huge Cambell soup can.
They did not use enough sound deadening material in the construction of the cover and door it appears.
It cooks VERY fast and quietly.
What the designers were thinking I don't know.
This oven was purchased because of it's sleek looks and relatively small width.
The owner's manual is complete and easy to read and understand.
VERY hollow and echoing metal sound making it sould cheap.
I have only TWO complaints.
The only light illuminates when the oven door is closed and the oven is working.
The controls are very easy to learn and use.

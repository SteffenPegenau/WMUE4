Watch out!
My daughter thinks this is hysterical.
She will spray her pee at you all at once.
I can't imagine how funny the boy model must be.
This frustrates my daughter.It is also difficult for little hands to put the new diapers on snugly so that it captures the pee properly.
My 4 year old received the Baby Alive Wets N' Wiggles doll from her grandparents recently.
LOL
I'm sure she'll get the hang of it, as it's only been a week, but she has a difficult time getting the bottle in the correct position.
Amazing.
Although my daughter loves it I'm finding it requires a lot of guidance and assistance.
I end up being the one putting on the new diapers, which is constantly.One other thing.
It shoots about 8 inches from her body.
And this is the girl model.
If the bottle is not in the perfect spot, Baby Alive will not drink the bottle and will fuss.
If Baby Alive hasn't really peed yet, you're in for a soaking.

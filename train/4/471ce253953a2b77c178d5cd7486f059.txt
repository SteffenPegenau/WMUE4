May be AVRCP is not that good.
I had to reset it or try the controls from the Phone to start playing again.
LG HBS-200 was the best in both count and it swiched between phone and music player automatically.
I used Windows media player from laptop and Pcoket Tunes from treo and Sony software from W580i.
Sound quality is good with music and OK with phone conversations.
However I will not rate this excellent.
I bought this from Amazon after trying out Insignia and LG HBS-200.
Otherwise I still like the LG.
It works well with Phone and Streo player.
However LG HBS-200 has serious design flow, it broke on the right ear side first followed by the left side.
Several reboots were required.
This works ok with my laptop and cellpone (treo 680 and Sony Ericsson w580i).
Bluetooth setup with Sony was easy, but not that easy with Treo 680/Softik Audio Gateway.
I had to call the customer support for setup.
However it has connection problems once it changes to phone mode while listening to Music.

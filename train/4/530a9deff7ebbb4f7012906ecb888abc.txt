- I love it.
WOW!For that, 12 stars.
If the heat becomes a real problem, I'll delete this review and write a new one that suitably trashes this product.
but the analog picture is superb.
And so far, so good.
But for now?
It won't sear your flesh, but it's disturbingly uncomfortable to handle after a few hour's use.
(I haven't yet gotten the required amplifier for my atsc antenna) There is simply no comparison between this card and either my WinTV 150 or WinTV 1600.
For the heat, 3.
The picure is actually crisper than the the analog tuner in my Olevia 27 inch widescreen flat panel.
I'll provisionally rate this at 4 stars.
factor.As for the heat, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for now.
And did I mention the picture quality?
I'm thinking that after 3 hour's use, it's about as hot as it's going to get.
For the price, this delivers a picture with a significant WOW!

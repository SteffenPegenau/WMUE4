they use a AAA.
displays time, pic of the album, battery life, time of song played & time expired.
i've seen high as 30GB but be prepared to spend.
but if you have a really LARGE library, i suggest something with large memory capacity like a creative zen.
good luck.
the battery is rechargable & replacable.
plus, you can only recharge via usb.
really nice feature there.
really nice.
this is a real nice unit.
but not like the c & e-models.
it has an equalizer, but not a customizable one.
also, it has a slot for mini sd cards for expandable memory.
the display is top notch.
the recording button can be pressed by accident much too easily.
great features, but here are a few that bugged me.
just pop in a new one & you're good to go.
not that convenient if you ask me.

* I found the cursor controls more suited for left-handed ppl.
* Very readable screen (I was pleasantly surprised).
(Each software has 2 licenses, for 2 devices).
I got it a license from my friend for CitySelect NA.
Brought this about a year ago and have been very satisfied with it.Pros:* Solid construction.
* Good battery life.
Even single hand operation is fine.
* The controls are slightly tedious, but works for a handheld.
* The software has some short-comings.
** Like you can find a place near a remote location.
if I am in San Francisco, I cant find a pizza place in San Jose.
* City software costs extra.
I am a lefty so I am happy :-).
* Expandable memory.
But seems better that garmin iQue.
It will only give me pizza place in I think 50m radius of San fran.
E.g.
Or maybe I am just used to it now.
This is included in the base software.Cons* The satellite reception is spotty under tree cover.
* Tracks are quite accurate.

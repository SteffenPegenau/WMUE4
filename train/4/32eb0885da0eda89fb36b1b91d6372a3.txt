So, do not expect much from this book regarding the ABCs of Flash4.
This book is unlike any other tutorial book who include a 1000 page manual with some silly jokes and load of text.
But, anyhow, I feel this book is a helpful guide for intermidiates and also for experts.
While you are practicing the examples given in the book, you find yourself becoming experts of Flash4.
It has a helpful CD-ROM and a real useful interface.
Get rid of all those theories; get practical, because practice maketh man perfect!
So, lets have our hands dirty.
To start with, Flash4 Magic is not for BEGINNERS.
Buy it if and only if you know some bits and pieces of Flash4.
Flash4 Magic doesn't do so.
This book includes some real good exmaples, which make you familiar with all the aspects of Flash4.
It is for people who know, atleast, the basics of Flash4.
You come to know Flash4 much better.
I would recommend you to get a copy now.
So, beginners can still have a second thought.

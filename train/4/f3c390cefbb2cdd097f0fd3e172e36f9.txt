Or have your husband deal with it.
If i put it up in the passenger seat, it fills up the seat and some of the dashboard.
The sacrifice for its modern look and elegant wheels.
This is the best stroller i beleive thats out there.
[...] This stroller is really nice, its easy to assemble.
Just push in the wheels and snap.
But it is so heavy for me.
But again the only flaw is its huge and heavy.
And even though it folds up real nice and easy its huge.
With one wrist even.
Its 28lbs.
Most strollers are bulky and big.
Its so easy to steer.
Just get it out and youll be good.
But at least this one makes it look good.

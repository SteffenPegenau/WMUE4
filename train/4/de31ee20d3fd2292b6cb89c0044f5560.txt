I thought they would taste COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
I thought I had them before.
Me and my friend ate a bag together while we were playing video games and pretty fast xp so try em!!
but anywhoo.. Whilst buying these green bean thingies..
ok, let me taste one more to make sure my findings are correct.. everyone in my family likes these.
haha I was wrong.
& then your saliva does it's thang and you want another.
ahem, ok.. four stars because I didn't fall to the floor in ecstasy or nada.
I got the original flavor.
The first "chip" is like wtf?
I didn't even taste it?
In case you were wondering.
All agree, don't judge by the first nibble :) half a bag is 130 or so calories.
The next one is like hmm.
I recommend.
oh PS..

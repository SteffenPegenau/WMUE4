The premise is thought provoking.
Why do we exist?
There are hints and explanations that seem to justify either or even justify both at the same time.
I think that this film does a fine job of highlighting our place and confusion in the world we face every day.
Is it all just science?
Do we do it for ourselves or others?
Is it simply enough to say "I am"?
The end of ourselves4 star rating for me.
Why is it important to keep on going when there is no hope and no future?
We can't know until the shadow catches up with us...and that's what we fear.
Despite the reviews this is a GOOD movie.
Is there a God?
I'd give it 5 but it's a little too smart for it's own good.
It's not a blockbuster and it isn't flashy, splashy teen entertainment, but it IS good.
However, the truth is that we just don't know.
Glad I caught it!

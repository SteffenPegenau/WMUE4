I maxed out on my free space, so I deleted songs to free up space.
It's perfect for jogging.
I love the size.
I don't know why Apple is making buggy software updates available for downloads.
I took off one star because user-friendliness is not what I expected with Apple's reputation.
If this happens to you, go directly to the discussion forum to find the fix.
Guess I'm just lazy and don't like having to go through the help menu.
The down side of these small devices is they're hard to find if you misplace them.
I spent hours and hours trying to fix the problem.
iTunes wouldn't let me add new songs even though it indicates that I have more than enough free space.
I installed the 6/23/06 update and my iPod stopped working.
Apparently others have run into the same problem.
I may have to restore and start over again.One BIG word of warning.
I'm still learning all the ins and outs of this device.
The general fixes on their website doesn't solve the problem.

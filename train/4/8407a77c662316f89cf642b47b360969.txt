Sure.
Do those of us who have been reading the series have some opinions as to where the plot should be going?
Is the writing becoming a bit formulaic?
So what's the problem?
Hmmm.
Of course.
JK
But you know something?
I'm ready!!
Just tell old GRR to boot up his computer and generate another volume.
The fact of the matter is that after having read the previous books there wasn't any way I wasn't going to read this one.
Could it be better?
In the final analysis, I read the book with greedy self-indulgence.
I was apprehensive about reading this after looking at a few unfavorable reviews.
The story continues!~!~ And there's more to come!!!

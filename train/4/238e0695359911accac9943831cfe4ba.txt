Try to imagine getting up without a ladder.
From reading I've found that Amy and her daughter survive, and speculation says Dan does as well.
Those that think this can't happen.
As a mom myself, if your child is stranded, that would put additional worry in.This movie was excellent.
To see a mother go thru this was awful.
All it takes is too much to drink or one moment of fun without thinking.
It truly showed the fear and the things that can happen.
It's based on a true story of things that happened, it easily could happen to anyone.
In life situations panic sets in, you can't think straight.
The ocean is a cruel place.
Everyone jumped in to swim, thinking someone else would lower the ladder.We have the video and I'll watch it again.
I think this movie was very heartbreaking.
Then look up.
Go on one and jump over.
Have you ever been on a large boat?
The only bad part is the ending.

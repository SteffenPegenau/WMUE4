I am sensitive to too much light when I sleep and the ability to lower the setting is awesome.
I do not want a lot of" bells and whistles", just a simple machine!
It is thick and inflexible.
When I turn the clock the way I want it to sit, the cord pulls it away.
Just pick your zone and voila!
When you set the alarm it advances in minutes up to 10 and then switches to 10 minute increments so it is quicker than other clocks.
The radio works great, better than any other clock I have ever had.
This clock was super easy to use and comes with the time zones already programed.
I am tempted to get another one because I like it so much.
This is a great clock.
I love the dual feature for weekends and naps.
So no 5 stars as a result.
The only thing I do not like about this clock is the cord.
I have never had such a simple clock.
(So far, anyway.)
Other than that it is great!

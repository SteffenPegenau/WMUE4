.
Otherwise, I am not sure I can recommend this!
I'll try to update after I try shot glass only and see if anything changes.
and if the temp is not where you want it, add more water!!!
I haven't tried it with just the shot glass yet, but the combo seems to work.
I added a shot glass filled with water and it hit 70% in a few hrs and holds.
Just make sure you add enough water .
I actually bought it again.
.
I no longer use the shot glass.
.
I have a 25 cigar humidor and struggle to maintain 70% humidity with this.
it lasted several months.
works well and I'm happy.
*update9/18/2012So, I added a little more water and it held the humidity at 65%.

WHY CANT THEY JUST RELEASE THEM ALL AT ONCE.
I THINK THIS IS GONNA BE A KICK ASS DVD FOR ALL FANS.

GO EDD BOYS GO.
THIS IS A DVD FOR ALL.
LIKE CRANK YANKERS SESSON 1 AND ALL THE SIMPSONS DVD,S DID.
I DONT HAVE IT YET BUT BY THE RATE OF THE SHOW IT SELF.
I SEEN EVERY EPISOD.
SORRY TO BREAK THE ALL 5 STARS STREAK.
FINALLY THE EDD,S ARE ON DVD.
THE SESSON 3 NOW IS GREAT AND THE OLDIES MUST BE PURE GOLD.

(...I got an idea... and it might sound silly but I wanna roll ya body in a tight brown phillie... crack it... lick it up... seal it air tight... get a light...) Love it!
*muah*
Everyone has people who hate 'em but whatever.
Those who like 'Roll Wit MVP' should listen to it.
It makes me think of summer ass shakin music.
I'd really like to see what it's all about and where he's gonna go.
I think the boi has talent.
No cursing!
I like the sound and the lyrics.
Just because he's white doesn't make me think he's the next Em tho.
I think the CD should be out sooner though.
The boi is sexie!
Also... Daymn!
It's a real change from what I normally listen to.
Presonally, I like 'Rock Ya Body' better.

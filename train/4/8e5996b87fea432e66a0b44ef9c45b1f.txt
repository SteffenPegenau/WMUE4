Yep, it won't close very good either.
They are right the scrapebook should have been designed to fit in the case.
Basically a rush job.
Which lacks the chapter insert.
Now I see why this is $13.99 and not more.
Disc 2 of this set is absurd.
And the interview with Kevin Costner looks to be in the same room and chair and setting he used for the interview on The new Bodyguard dvd.
Nothing much new.
And trust me you need to put it back on.
;) The running commentary is a bit of a laugh though :) Loved it.They also seemed to have fixed the closed captioning.
Bad design there.
Almost a major headache to put the slip cover back on.
The only reason to buy it of course though is the Superbit presentation.
The original was just embarassingly wrong.
Since i own the old dvd set I simply stuck that chapter insert in the new set.

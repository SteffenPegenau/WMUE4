I am a slave to plastic..........
For those of us who can't help themselves and have to have all our plastic with us, this is the wallet.
Of course my license, AAA Card and a couple of gas cards.
You decide what you can leave behind.
Have to have my rewards cards with me.
Needs something to anchor it to wallet.2.
I have my Visa Card, Amex cards, mastercard, discover card.
However there are a number of difficulties:1.
The plastic insert does not work well.
You need to keep it in a front pocket.
It can be a little difficult to get cards out.Otherwise it does the job.
Does not fit in back and to rely on a pocket in a jacket is not practical.3.
Medicare Card, Supplement Card, Hospital Blue Card.
Could I go out without a number of grandchildren's pictures.
And finally the Frequent Flyer Cards, Htel Cards and Rental Car Cards.
Then I have Macy's , Kohls and Best Buy.

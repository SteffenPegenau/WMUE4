Chris Evans(the jock) had some good parts, but he said and did some really shocking things and things he said was quite shocking.
Which I will not mention.
The characters all did a good job.
This movie I thought was a a little bit better than Scary Movie.
The movie all I can say was really funny and shocking at the same time.
The cruelest girl which is The jock's sister was funny, but the kissing scene was gross.
I can't wait though when it comes out on DVD!
It made me laugh, but it was gross.
It has a sick sense of humor.
I hated that.
I rated this item a four because some scenes were just to unbelievable and it doesn't really keep you laughing all the time.
The dildo scene in the beginning with the Stupid Ugly Girl was funny, but it was put in a nasty way too.
I thought the girl on the cheerleading squad with terrets was really funny.
The toilet scene of the girl was nasty.
I wish or hope they make a sequel with all the same characters.

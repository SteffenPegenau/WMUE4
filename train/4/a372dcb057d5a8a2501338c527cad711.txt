It does seem to make my bedroom cooler.
I really have enjoyed it.
Perhaps it should be but the peace it has given me has been worth the price.
I haven't been woken up since!
I keep it on low speed and it isn't too loud for me, but I could see how it may bother others.
After failed attempts of trying to address the problem, and after much frustration, I bought this.
A neighbor a couple houses down leaves for work at 4:15 AM.
I didn't buy it sooner because it seemed to me for what the device does it should be cheaper.
It would be nice if it looked a little better setting in my bedroom.
I don't notice it blowing any air but it still must move enough air to make the it a bit cooler.
I know this because that is when his dogs start barking.
I should have bought this much sooner.
I put another blanket on my bed.
I love that you can adjust the pitch.
Minor complaints though.

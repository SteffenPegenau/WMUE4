It works and can easily overpower the speaks.I sit really close to all the speakers so I am immersed in Logitech sound... Hehe.
The speaks mout easily.
I'm listening to some Black Uhuru right now pretty loud and it sounds good.
the little dongle remote thing is odd, but puts volume where I need it.
I never hear anyone else talking about, "Logitech sound"... Everything else about the system is 5 stars.
I like it, but know that it is far from audiofile sound.
It does the job.
Logitech has a sound... You either like it, or you don't.
That's just me.
Replaced my worn out Klipsch 5.1 system.
I like that it is pretty loud where I am, but one room away, if the woof woof isn't turned too high, it isn't loud at all.I gave it 4 stars simply because of the Logitech sound.
You can get used to it.
I like the center mount front speak.
The system works great.
The bass is woof woof, but nothing window shaking.

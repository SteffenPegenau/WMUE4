I don't like loud music anyway.
What a nice peice of furniture (radio) for a small room.
For me, that's fine.
Just decorative.
I got it today and I love it alot.
But for those of you who are looking for more dynamic room-filling music, stay away from this.
This is not the cheap wood I though it would be.
Maybe needs occasional polishing to keep it nice.
It is real and heavy.
It is brand new and it's got 'Nostagia'
Adds class.
The CD player is programmable and hidden underneath the nice wood door on top.
It's brand new so it works well.I gave it only 4 stars because of 1 thing: It doesn't get loud.
This is more subtle and for decor than it is for orchestra-style theater audio.PS> This is NOT an antique radio.
This is destined to be a collectible someday.This gives the real 30's - 40's vintage look to your room without the heavy price tag.
It is indeed a CD player, top-loading turn-table incased in a beautiful REAL WOOD veneer cabinet.

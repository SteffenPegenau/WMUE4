For comfort and convenience, it's an easy 4 stars.
The cupholder is screwed into place on the arm of the chair.
The backpack function is excellent.
Excellent beach chair for upright or recline comfort.
It has a flap to keep out the sand.
It doesn't recline far enough to make laying on your stomach too comfortable though.
Recommended.
It has a cupholder made of the same material.
The straps fairly comfortably make carrying the chair easy while freeing up your hands.
It looks good enough though that I bought two more.
I'm borderline 4 stars until I give it more usage to see how well it holds together.
Overall, I give it 3 stars.
I expect that after some use it will probably detach.
The storage pouch on the back of the chair is very roomy; you can carry quite a bit.
I've used it for two summers and it seems to be holding up well.

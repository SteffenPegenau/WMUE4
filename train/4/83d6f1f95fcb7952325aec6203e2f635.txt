In this story Miaka becomes part of the story.
It made me laugh in places.
.
Howere unlike Inuyasha, the girl is sucked into a book and is the hero of the story.
It's like Inuyasha by Rumiko Takahashi, in that the girl is taken back in time.
I won't give it away.
.
The stroy is facinating.
Even thought in palces in the translation they call Miaka the princess even though she is the priestess (Suzaku no Miko).
The anime is good but the manga is way better.
Of cousrse it's funny considering your main characters are a 15 year old clueless junior high girl who is a glutton, a cute miser, a narasasic emporer and .
Its a good story and it has lots of cute guys.
I definatly recomend this one.
The art work of Watase Yu is fabulous.
In Inuyasha the main character time travels through a well.
This is a great story.
But besides that it was wonderful.
I liked the paradies and the Manga talks.

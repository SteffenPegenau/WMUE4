We spend months at a time in the RV and it is nice not to haul the extra weight of books since we are avid readers.
And we can still highlight and bookmark passages we want to reread.
Very easy to browse, order, and download.
They came out with the latest upgrade a few days after we bought this.
Primary reason for purchase was for travel.
Frustrating but not a big problem.
Overall we are very satisfied.
I truly appreciate the dictionary always being at hand.
My only complaint is the "joy stick".
I have tremors and this is very small and sensitive to touch.
I understand the problem I mentioned has been improved.
Very easy to use and instructions are easy to understand.
I sometimes have to go foward and back before being able to highlight the item I need.
There have been some complaints about the lack of pictures in the paper but we want the news so we are satisfied.
We can still receive our Readers Digest and an added benefit of receiving our daily newspaper.

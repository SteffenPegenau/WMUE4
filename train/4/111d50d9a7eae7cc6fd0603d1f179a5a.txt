War is never good, but it makes an excellent storyline within the Star Trek universe.
The Klingon storyline gets a little thin.
The aliens are once more likeable and believable.
Indeed, the Federation itself is being taken where it has never been before-under seige!I am sure there will be a happy ending.
It seems this crew is destined to be my favorite.
The Tribble episode is worth the price of entire season.
It is done with such skill that the time travel sequence seems real for a moment.
This is the first time this has happened on such a scale.
The Dominion War looms on the horizon.
By the season finale, The station begins to seem vulnerable.
It is a loving tribute that I will remember for awhile!I am really liking the characters now.
The early seasons did an effective job setting them up.
I eagerly anticipate next season!
It is also slow in a few episodes.
This season has moments of brilliance.

After I got my hose reel out of the box and before I put it together I spayed painted it with Krylon.
It took 1 can & a piece of another.
Simple to put together.
This is my 2nd hose reel cart.
A specially designed brass part broke and I could not get a replacement part for it.
So here are a couple things to think about when buying a hose reel cart.1) (Make sure you can buy parts for your hose reel)... my first one was from Sams Club.
Now its green.Thats about it.
;-)2) (All hose reels in time WILL rust) Sorry.
Plus too I wasn't crazy about the color of the hose reel anyway (tan).
With this Liberty Garden hose reel, you can buy parts for it.
I think they changed that design from the first ones.
So I'm turning that hose reel into a cart to pull behind the lawn mower.
That should seal it a little better.
You could not get parts for it.
If its something that's around water in time will rust.
2 metal shafts for the wheels make it a little more sturdier.

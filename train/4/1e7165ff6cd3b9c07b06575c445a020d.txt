Which is great by itself but as of now!!!
I can deal with the added Heft.
not compatible with the Optima BPG.
Uses way to many batteries.
Like the Multiple shutter buttons.
Don't know actually how much battery life I've gained using the battery grip compared to the A100's battery.
Adds heft and bulk to the A100.
Sort of gives the A100 a Pro Digital Camera look.I also have the A100 Body Armour.
I guess I'll see how long I can deal with the Bulk when I go on Vacation.
Had to modify a $40.00 Body Armour to get it the way I like.
The Downside for me is Bulkiness it adds to the A100.
I'm not a Pro and the Ideal of carrying a Bulky camera around all day does'nt suit me.
but if it's suppose to last way longer I guess it's worth it.
Bottom Line so far I like mine.
It's on the camer always I'm for it.
gives you various grip options.

"Staring At the World through my Rearview" I l kinda liked that one.
that was when I first got it.
On "Free Em All" there's a guy tryna sound like Tupac, but that track is still hott.
That's perhaps the hottest joint down by Tupac.
Hollywood Bank Roberry when i first heard it, I didn't like it.
It wasn't as good as the Second one, but it still had some good songs on it.
A "MUST GET" mos def.
Skip a lil to 6 Feet wit Storm, well done.
Blazin~!!
When I first put it in, Made Niggaz was the first song I heard.
Tray Dee had a solid performance on it.
I wasn't that much of a Death Row fan until I heard this album.
Then Tupac and the Outlaws at the end, another tight one.Then I put in the first CD.
That's the song that got me hooked into listenin to Tupac.
The song after that with Kurupt was a tight track as well.
Now, I heard it yesterday and it was pretty good.Overall: This is tight.
"Questions" and "Free em All" were the best on that CD.

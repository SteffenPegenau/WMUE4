This shoe is a combination of sneaker, walking and hiking shoe.
They wear like iron.
Added note: it has been one week since I've owned my new shoes.
I would prefer leather.
Back they go.
After wearing them once I notice that the stitching near the laces on one shoe is separating.
I was so impressed I recently ordered two pair, one in white, one in black.
Recently I ordered my third pair.
My only concern is that much of what was leather in my older shoes is now "synthetic leather", a nice phrase for plastic, rubber.
They have an aggressive sole.
I wore them out and purchased another.
The inner cushioning quickly adjusts to each foot.
Years ago I found the Skechers Afterburn Sneakers and purchased a pair.
If you choose the right size (in my case, wide), they are very comfortable.
Maybe they aren't as tough as they used to be.

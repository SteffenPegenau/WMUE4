Thats alright mama.
I was a little disappointed by some of the seemingly out of place tunes (feeling groovy?
Wamba-jamba.
Very dated.
but the guitar work is killer and its live and crisp.
But man can he play guitar.I'd keep 5 of 10 songs for a personal custom cd...
*****'Together till the end of time'.
Season of the witch?)
They should have replaced this with another Johnny Winter cut.
Bluesy, slow, 10 minute jam.
'One Way Out' kicks things off with ferocious guitar work.
This is a must have CD for Bloomfield/Kooper fans.
**'Don't throw your love on me so strong' Yet another fantastic bluesy hard driving guitar tune albeit suffering only from Mike's vocal limitations.
Bloomfield showing the limitations of his vocals but still a vintage and electrifying piece of guitar work.
Nausea.
Slow, melodramatic, romantic?
*****'Intro to Johnny Winter'... historical *****'Its my own fault' Excellent *****'Please tell me partner.
*****'Thats all Right'.

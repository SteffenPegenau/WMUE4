Whereas, some higher priced models weigh the size of a piece of paper.
I did buy another set of rechargable batteries because of other customer reviews.
Picture quality is awesome!!!
Storage with the generic memory card is good.

I teach photography and thought this would be a great digital camera to introduce to those hesitant to jump into the digital age.
I have owned since November and have taken over 300 pictures.

34MB is perfect.
Battery life has not been a problem at all.
My review follows.
Invest in a larger memory card and your set.
This product rates 4.5 in my book!
Zooming in to objects can be somewhat limited but is adequate.
The weight of the camera feels sturdy.
The average--- 1.

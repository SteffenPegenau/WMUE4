But i shoot my 325 spring at the fence at about 2 feet.
But it only came with one clip (which I was dissapointed) and no mag clampGOOD GUN!
Reasing me too believe that it has more fps than the box says.
It came with a adjustable front handle.
The battery came semi charged, but charge before use.
Nothing was broken.
The Clip was plastic.
It made a small dent.
This is a good gun.
Out of the box it got about 380 fps.
Some of the extra things on the outside of the gun are really hard plastic.
Overall good gun.
Which is really helpful.
But the box said it had 338 fps.
But with this AK at about 20 ft it made a bigger dent.
I bought it from topdogairsoft.

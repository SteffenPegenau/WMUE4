This game is almost too good to be true!
You can choose: Too Easy.
You create your player, then go skate.
I bought it and once I started playing I couldn't stop.
But another cool thing is, you can decide how hard the game is.
For people that are playing for the first time and have no idea what they're doing.
Great game!
You can get off your board for huge combos, you can only get off your board for a limeted time to stay in a combo.
Beware some goals are a magnet to frustration.
Beginner: For people who have played a couple times and at least know what they're doing.
I suggest you buy it!
You can create a park and put goals in it.
And last, Sick: Really hard goals for really good players.
If you like THPS4, you'll love this game.

Hardly.I think this is Matthew Scott Hansens first novel.
I was really disappointed in one character, Ben.
But sadly, it wasn't.
There were lots of characters in the book to keep up with but they all came together to make the story flow.
He's an old Indian who has the ability to "communicate" with the creature mentally.
The dust cover says it will make you think twice before going camping again.
That was disappointing.
Kinda goofy, I agree.
He certainly has potential.
But the rest of the book was okay.
He could have added much to the story if this telepathy concept had been fully developed.
He wove a good story.
Yes, the subject matter is a bit silly: a 1400 pound, 11 foot sasquatch (with an intelligent, but limited, mind) running all over the place killing people for revenge.
But the author wove a pretty good story and developed the characters pretty well.
Well, I liked this book.

I will weigh myself tomorrow and start wave 2.
The recipies are tasty.
No fancy ingredients, everything is at your local market.If this book does anything it will teach you that food can be tasty without the fat and sugar.
THIS BOOK IS GREAT!
I feel better knowing that I really do have control!
I had no idea.
After jogging and exercising in many ways I decided to address my diet.
Ok, it gets a little preachy about the size of the plate and doesn't speak much to the neccessity of physical activity.
I put on 20 pounds.
The public is bombarded with so many diets each year.
I have always been pessimistic about diet books.
What this book does do is point out HOW MUCH SUGAR AND FAT WE ALL EAT.
You can follow the easy tips and switch off to meals you like better or ones that are easy to prepare.
I turned 40 quit smoking and got remarried in the space of 3 years.
I lost 5 pounds in the first 7 days.Today is day 10.

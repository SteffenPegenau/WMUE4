this cd takes me back.
decent rock tunes that will get you singing along, or someting.
me and my jnco pants.
young and in love.
anyway...the cd is actually OK. even if you aren't in middle school.
oh, the good times.
i know, i know.
i think that this cd changed my life.
sitting im my room listening to this cd.
i was such the cool kid.
well, lets just say i was young.
anyway..this album was a life changing expereince, simply cause i got to look cool by putting a bush sticker on my notebook.
back to the days of antioch middle school.
how the heck can some stupid wanna nirvana band change the life of someone?
oh wait..different story.

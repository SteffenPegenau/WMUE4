Its so fast and amazing, I thought Steve's guitar would catch on fire!
It was inspired by Steve's crossroads riff.
Juice is amazing.
Final grade: A-
He did this as a "I don't care what the cridics think about it cause thiws is my feelings played on guitar" type album.
Boy from Seattle is a beautiful tribute to Jimi Hendrix.
While a little supprised that it only has 7 songs I was pretty much blown away.
Bad horsie is really good.
Some people think its funny, I think its nerve racking.
Then theirs the 7th song, Tender surrender.
This album was recorded in the middle of fire garden's recording.
Die to live makes me wonder if Steve is really from Earth.
I bought this after hearing tender surrender and bad horsie.
Every song on here is great with the exception of "ya-yo gakk" which is one of Steve's sons sayin ya-yo gakk and squeeling over and over.
It starts off slow then really speads up whith fast scales amazing riffs.

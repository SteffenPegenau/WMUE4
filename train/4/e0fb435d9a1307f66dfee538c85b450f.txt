In general, Enya manages to do this by producing beautiful, calming music that doesn't just fade into the background (which those two "OKs" do).
Flora's Secret -- 4 Stars7.
Pilgrim -- 4 Stars10.
One By One -- 5 Stars11.
Of the remaining four tracks, two get good ratings and, unfortunately, two get merely OK ratings (that's why I can't give the overall CD an Excellent).
Wild Child -- 5 Stars3.
Silver Inches -- 5 Stars9.
Tempus Vernum -- 2 Stars5.
Lazy Days -- 3 Stars
It stays in the foreground and makes you listen to it.
Fallen Embers -- 3 Stars8.
My specific track ratings are:1.
A Day Without Rain -- 5 Stars2.
Deora Ar Mo Chroi -- 2 Stars6.
I've given almost half the tracks (five) excellent ratings, while two more get really good ratings.
Only Time -- 5 Stars4.
I love this CD.

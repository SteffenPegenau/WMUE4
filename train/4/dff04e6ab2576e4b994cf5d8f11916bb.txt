radiohead's always been a band to put lots of work into their music, and this is no exception.
quite cool.
"a reminder" - wow.
"melatonin" - so beautiful.
"palo alto" - a pablo honey-sounding straight-up rock song.
lyrics and music are great.
can't ask for more, right?
this song is amazing.. thom wrote it as a kind of letter to his young self, from the perspective of an old unhappy man.
"airbag" - of course we all know this fabulous song, but this time, there's a surprise!
very good!
what a cool ep!
"meeting in the aisle" - a trancey techno hypnotizing song.
a hypnotic rock song.
"polyethylene" - one of the most beautiful openings in music i've ever heard, which breaks out into a jam thing, very much like "the aeroplane flies high" by smashing pumpkins.
instead of the familiar sounds of "paranoid android" coming after it, we venture into a whole new musical journey........."pearly" - yes!!
what a great song.

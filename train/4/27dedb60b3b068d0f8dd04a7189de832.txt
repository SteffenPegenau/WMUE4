Double troble if you ask me.
In the end one man dies (Wayne) the other marries the women who is a reporter for a newspaper.
It too is a love story but with much suspense at every turn.
The Fighting Seabee's is of course a war film set during WWII.
1840's.
Formation of the naval unit called Construction Battallon or Sea bees as it came to be knowen, is told by the members of a civilian gang of workers.
It tells of a women's love for one man and another man at the same time.
Here are two more films of John Wayne that are thrillers.
In the other film, John Wayne portrays a sea captian sailing the South Sea's.
The time is approx.
Good cast in this film too.
Both films are in black and white but this one is a good sea story.
They go to war on Island X to build airstrips and oil storage tanks.
I know that if you get these two films, romance and surprise are in store for you.
Good films over all.
Action is all part of what happens to the ship and later to him (Wayne).

I will keep an lookout on their website.
Product itself is standard Chinese knock-off of GI ripstop waterproof poncho in German flectarn pattern.
.
I plan to get at least two more.This outfit wants our business.
I chose surface delivery which took a little longer than expected, but these folks had it priced to cover shipping and even that price was competitive with others who would charge more and charge for shipping on top of that.
.
.
not as sturdy as the old GI types,but more than serviceable.
.
they also included a 5% discount coupon with the order.
.
No problem with delivery.
.
Not much, but still better than a poke in the eye.
Hope they offer more military surplus.

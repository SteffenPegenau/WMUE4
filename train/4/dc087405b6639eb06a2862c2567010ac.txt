4.5 STARS!
Cookys11.
It certainly starts out strong with what is now one of my favorite house tracks ever, "Here I Am".
Once In a LifetimeGuess I didn't like the even numbered tracks as well, though those were generally very solid as well.
Love the vocalist, love the music.
I Knew You When13.
And while I don't like this CD quite as much as Kaskades non-compilation efforts, "It's You, It's Me" and "In the Moment", this a simply not to be missed for any lover of house music.
Life w/o Kaskade...well, please don't let me imagine it!
Here I Am3.
There are may other awesome tracks here, including:1.
Don't Give It Up7.
It is David Morales, who I also love, but sounds 100% Kaskade.
Everything9.
There were a few slightly lackluster tracks on this album, but all in all it is a very satifying listen, especially late at night or on the weekends.
This album is another great OM product, and a Kaskade one at that.

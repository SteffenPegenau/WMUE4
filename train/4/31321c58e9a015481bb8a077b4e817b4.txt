They are wimps.
The climax is Great I think when they finnaly get to the buffalo preserve and fall in the blood it makes it more exciting.
The second rising action involves the bedwetters escaping and telling alot of flashbacks.
The rising action gets better.
This is a really good book.
The beginning is ok.
Not for kids under 13.
Then lastly there is no falling action so that sucks, it just abruptly stops in the climax.
I the process... of being men.
They are wedbetters.
They escape and thats the end of what I think is the second rising action.
They always cry, they always wet the bed.
When they are actually releasing them its funny because they are driving in a van throwing food at them.
Overall this is a great book If I were you I would deffinitaley by this book.
I wont tell you the story, but it gets better.

I recommend this CD to anyone who likes great early 70s hit songs.
Brand New Key - Melanie2.
Hot Rod Lincoln - Commander Cody & Lost Planet Airmen8.
All original hits.
Brand New Key and How Do You Do could be described as cutesy, whereas Nice To Be With You is good mainstream pop.
- Mouth & MacNeal10.
Funky, danceable numbers are included in Rock Steady, Clean Up Woman, and the risque Jungle Fever.
Oh Girl - Chi-Lites9.
Suavecito - Malo6.
Clean Up Woman - Betty Wright3.
The songs on this CD are all wonderful, considering their breadth of style.
How Do You Do?
Oh Girl is a classic soul ballad, whereas the soft Suavecito has a slight Latin flair.
Many of these songs are otherwise hard to find.
Humor songs are well represented in Hot Rod Lincoln and I Gotcha.
I Gotcha - Joe Tex7.
Song list (since it's not listed):1.
Rock Steady - Aretha FranklinThis collection of hit songs is especially interesting.
Nice To Be With You - Gallery5.
Jungle Fever - Chakachas4.

this is where most movies fail.
They didn't give away anything in the previews.Which is good.
However the special effects were off the hook.
I found myself still talking about this movie a month after I saw it.
then it would of been hype.
However, the people in Hollywood can't stop the urge to just shoot things up.
And I saw kids in the movie theatre!
Everything was a surprise.
I do not agree with the violent content in this movie.
They glamourized guns in this movie.
I've never seen a movie like it in my life.
I'm still unclear of what the matrix is because I think It's more complex than a simple definition.The only bad thing about the movie is that the violence should of been replaced by martial arts.
It could of had 5 stars if it wasn't so violent.
When I first went to go see this movie I didn't know what to expect.
I couldn't get it out of my mind.

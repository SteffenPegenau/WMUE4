The concept was good: taking off from John Coltrane's spiritual plane.
The title cut is very nice makeout music.
Yet, as early, somewhat funky new age music it ain't so bad.
So it settles into an easy listening groove that almost floats away on good vibes.
This is a tough album to review because it isn't a true Rascals release, just Felix & Dino, & it is flawed.
No point in complaining about Peaceful World.
But the jazz musicians, with the exception of Alice Coltrane, aren't good ones for the job.
You'll know if you need to have it in your collection.
But if you prefer unqualified praise, don't listen to a 20 year veteran of New York free form radio.Bob Rixon, WFMU-FM
Every song gives up a nice riff or two.
The ethereal spaces of Mother Nature Land & Little Dove are hard to resist.
I do.
& the price is real good for what was a double LP.
Dino plays great throughout.
A couple of songs are first rate, particularly Love Letter.

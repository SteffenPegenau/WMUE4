I probably wouldn't buy so many books if it were not free.
I just bought it, so I'm still getting use to handling it.
I love it and so will you if you love electronics.
Then when you're ready to turn the page you're already in position.
I only read a few of the directions, and I was off navigating through it.
It is very user friendly.
Speaking of handling...it's soooo light!
That is a very big plus.
I now buy more books than I have ever done in my life.
It is totally cool and the books are CHEAP!
Your hand/arm doesn't get tired holding.
I can use my right hand to steady the Kindle and use the other buttons.
The free wireless is a huge plus.
However, I think I've found a way to overcome this problem...leave it in its cover, support it with your left hand, and then allow your left hand fingertips to lightly rest on the "next page" button.
The only thing wrong with the Kindle is that I hit the forward button too much.

My first PDA was a Palm Pilot Pro.
Just turn both on, point the IRs at each other and, seconds later, all done.
Then I got a Casio E-10.
Faster.
The IR feature worked great with my portable.
But visibility in bright daylight was bad.
Still tastes like human poop though.
It was slow, even with added RAM.
No cradle needed (although one was included).
And it's faster still.
Entering data was not easy.
Getting it to backup/sync with my main computer was a chore.
E-105 solves that problem and has 32MB of RAM to upload Expedia Maps.
It easily synced with MS Outlook.
Easy to enter data using virtual keyboard or hand printing (no special characters like Palm's Jot).
Of course, the 56K color screen garners lots of attention when I pop it out in meetings!

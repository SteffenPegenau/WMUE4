The storyline twists and turns.
The dialogue is macho, hilarious, smart, filthy.
And it's true.
Wow!
There, I said it.
It's a guy's flick that the ladies can enjoy, namely because of Matt Damon and Leo DiCaprio.
This is Scorsese's best since Goodfellas.
Forget all the CSI and NYPD Blue piffle - it's boring; we've seen it all before.
Oh, my!
Nuff said.
Good cops, bad cops, undercover cops, gangsters and thieves.
The Departed!
I had forgotten how fun a movie can be.
The performances are great all around - Alec Baldwin, Nicholson and Wahlberg deserve much props.
The film takes the whole cop movie genre to all new heights.
If you've forgotten how fun an experience at the movies can be, run out and see The Departed.

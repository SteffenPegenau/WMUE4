Move Seoul = Suffer5.
First of all the review - WaxTrax fans won't be dissappointed.
Party Zone = Cull11.
Skeletons by Nature = Thanksgiving6.
Sun 90 = Isolation10.
Unshakeable Remix = Sun 90
Thanksgiving = Beijing3.
Isolation = Spinning on My Head7.
No Way = Skeletons by Nature9.
I am also a big fan of Joy Division and Dessau's cover of Isolation is great, so you can imagine my surprise when the track called Isolation is not the cover, but then when I played Sun 90 I heard Isolation!
Anyway, here are the correct titles:1.
Spinning on My Head = Unshakeable Remix4.
Suffer = Party Zone2.
Cull = Move Seoul8.
Beijing = No Way12.
I gave it 4 stars because there are three songs I am indifferent to, but the rest of the album I like.Secondly and the whole reason I decided to post anything - the tracks listed here and other sites (including CDDB) are not in the correct order.

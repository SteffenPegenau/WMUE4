In the wild's of Kentucky(1985) the glam rock was everywhere.
They use to rock.
But let me go back.
That is when I first heard "The Confessor".
I use to listen to 100KDF out of Nashville.
That's when we made this song the"HOT TUB CLUB " song.
If it wasn't for the song "Confessor" where would I be?
Listen to it and enjoy.
A friend and I had picked up our dates and headed there.
By the way,only 2 songs are on the album I liked.
Oh yes.
But it was good in the glam rock days when you needed something to really rock!.
What made it so neat was that we had a place, an old campground, where the only thing left was the old hot tub and pool, that is where we use to go.
Rest of the songs are bad, except "I broke My Leg" which is different and funny.
"The Confessor" and "Hard to Keep a Good Man Down".It's just a strange, mysterious and a different mood setting music.
We called our little place the HOT TUB CLUB.
WOW!
It was a hot, humid KY night.

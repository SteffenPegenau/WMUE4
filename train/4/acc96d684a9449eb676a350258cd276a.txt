Songs like M+M's where they want girlfriends are the past.
Then this album came out.
I was surprised at how good it was.
Songs like Feeling this where they just want to be with their girl are the future.
They all fell in love and this helped to mature them.
This album is different than previous efforts.
Talk about a shocker of an album.
It really shows on this album when you read this lyrics and listen to the songs.
It has quite a few slower tracks.
Every song sounded the same and was stupid.
Both Mark and Tom are married and Travis has a new girlfriend.
Standout ones include feeling this, obvious, violence, go, all of this and i miss you.
They are happy and content with life.
I had given up on Blink after take off your pants.
What's great is that they finally grew up.

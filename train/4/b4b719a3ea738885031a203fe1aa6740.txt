TURN IT DOWN HAD A FLAW IN RECORDING.
LADY STARLIGHT, I WANNA BE COMMITTED,SOLID GOLD BRASS AND TEENAGE RAMPAGE AWESOME SONGS.
6-TEENS AND MADUSSA ALRIGHT.
BUT STILL STOOD OUT AFTER IT GOT GOING.
USUALLY IT IS THE OTHER WAY AROUND FOR A DIGITALLY REMASTER.
MY GENERATION-THE WHO'S RECORDING DONE BY THEM DONE WELL.
I HAVE A LOUD BUTTON ON MY RECIEVER.
IF TURNED OFF.
WAS HIGH VOLUME WHEN STARTED OUT.
THEN GOT WEAK IN SOUND.
FOX ON THE RUN- NOT ORIGINAL USA VERSION.
ALTERNATE VERSION FOR U.K.
IT SOUNDS BETTER AND CLEAR.
MAN WITH A GOLDEN ARM (DRUM SOLO) TOO LONG.
THE ANALOG REMASTERS WAS USED MAKING THIS CD.

A standard comming of age/struggle to get into dream college story added with some comic relief was all I was expecting.
Go Bears....
Jack Black is of course gleefully absurd as usual, and Colin Hanks is solid as the main character.
She's very pretty, but not unbelievably so.
And the ending is very good, very original.
She's got that down-to-earth, girl-next-door quality that many boast but few possess.
Yes, the movie is all of that, but more.
It has real heart that comes through to the audience.
I won't spoil it per se, but let's just say that I'm a UC Berkeley student, and the ending made me happy.
Also watch for a delightful cameo by Ben Stiller.
Schuyler Fisk is a welcome and refreshing addition to the cast as Hanks' charming girlfriend.
What can I say?
In other words, we believe she's a real person.
She's just really really...likeable.
Okay, I wasn't expecting much out of this movie.
There's some good acting and good character development.

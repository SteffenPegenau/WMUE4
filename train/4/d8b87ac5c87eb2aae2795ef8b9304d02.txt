It is very fun and is enjoyable.
Also the toy is fun for about two weeks then the speacailness wears off.
If your son or daguater is buying one i suggest you talk with the childrens parents in the neghibor hood.
[...].
Please don't let my review stop you from making your child happy.
If person you are buying it for is in to spying then i highly suggest it.
It is so complicated.
Once i got it i had no clue to what it was like.
It is very useful for the person with out a clue.
It sits in the corner of the room picking up the dust.
It is very fun to use.
Usually because the toy is hard to use.
I happen to have a lego spybotic.
I am a lego lover.
The missons are king of corny and some of the misson need two people.
That was just a tip.Lego spybotcs are fun but are they worth the money.

The show helped me learn alot about myself, I incorporated many of my thoughts, actions and talents from the students of "good 'ol Bayside High."
In Junior high school, I acted just like her.
Jessie was my favorite because she was so smart.
Kelly was alright, but she was a little dense.
I wanted to be her!
I did admire her relationship with Zack though.
The girls were fabulous.
But Ms.
Oh, Oh!
Take a cool school, add six attractive teenagers with killer clothes and you have magic!
Turtle was the BOMB!!!
How's that for a self-conscious, but smart young man.
I could totally relate to everyone on the show.
I just liked Zack, Slater was cool, and Screech was the bomb!
Being a fan of Saved by the Bell obsessively forever.

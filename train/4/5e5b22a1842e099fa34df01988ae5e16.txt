There'a a version of "Light My Fire", sans organ solo, by Train.
That's as many as can be expected on ANY CD!
The last 30 seconds or so of this song alone make it worth buying.
Excellent and unique!
The best cut is "Wild Child" by the Cult.
Even better than the Doors original version from "the Soft Parade" album.
What a powerful band!
I thought it was dreadful the first time I heard it.
However, after repeated plays it sort of grows on you.
It's tightly edited organ music from "When the Music's Over" with new spoken poetry consisting of lines from "The Celebration of the Lizard" with a great beat!
And Ray Manzarek on keyboards is the icing on the cake.
I'd say 7 of 17 cuts on this CD are very good to excellent.
"Light My Fire" without the trademark organ solo is a song with its heart and soul cut out.
It does have a short & sweet guitar solo which sounds alot like Krieger himself.
My second favorite track is "Children of Night".

It gives off tons of heat.
The TV works fine and it doesn't have any cracks/scratches, but still.
It almost heats up my room very quick.3.
Other then that it works fine for games and television.
It has a protective cover for all the corners and some screen tape, and that's all.Other than those minor complaints I feel I got what I paid for.
I purchased it through Best Buy because I wanted the TV on the day and they had one in stock.
I am new to the HD big screens, so that might be the standard, but I was surprised.
I would recommend this to someone else!
Except for Halo 3 coop...I will have to figure that out, if I don't, I will buy another tv for playing games with friends.2.
I use x-box live and when I download a TV, half of my screen gets cut off.
I have had it for 2 weeks now and it is still up and running.
The packaging was horrible.
I do have some complaints though.1.
This TV works fine.
This might just be a setting that I can't figure out, but it still sucks.

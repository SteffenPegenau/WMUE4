So don't do that.My only drawbacks are the "color/size coded" pins.
And if you use a heat protection spray before you roll your hair, curls last twice as long and are very soft to the touch.I stupidly stacked my 2 sets while heating because I don't have the counter space at my small sink.
What a hardy set.
They are navy blue, black and pink.
But if you read reviews on other sets, almost every device people are complaining about a flimsy lid.They come with metal clips which snuggly hold the roller.
These babies last forever.
Sets hair in no time and lasts all day.
I bought 2 sets at a beauty supply store about 5 years ago.
Easy to use the first time.
Melted a hole in the center of the bottom plastic lid.
Navy and black look downright identical and I always grab the wrong size.
I love this set.
Yes, the lid is plastic and flimsy.
My other complaint is that I think my rollers do overheat from time to time.Other than that.
No beginners curve either.

Can't remember.
Elijah Wood was cool in it, well, he is the hottest guy alive...yeah, anyways.
It was such a cute movie!
!
Ok, it just was too old fationed.
Ok, about the movie, it was sooo good!
The others are just kinda dull, if ya know what i mean.
Or, was that his age in the movie?
And jeez!
This one actually brought the book out, and made it seem real!
I absolutely loved it!
And yes, they did lower Huck's age to accomadate for the appearance of Wood, because in reality, he was 12 years old.
So, i went and read the book.
So, i would recommend it to anyone!
I know, i know, too big for a 12 year old, but i did.
I saw the version made in the 60's, and was not impressed by it at all.
Well, i really liked this movie!
Wood is such a cute kid!!
It was thick!
And, i thought that he pulled off the character very well.

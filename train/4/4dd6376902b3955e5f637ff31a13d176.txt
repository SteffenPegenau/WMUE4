He even woke up his dad at 5am to play with it again.
It's a wonderful toy!
Maybe the company heard the complaints and fixed all the complaints because I have no complaints about this toy!
Great toy!
He LOVES it!
There was a great instruction manual that came in the box (VERY easy to assemble!!)
My son loves playing with it and drawing on it.
!The only bad thing is the eraser is a tiny yellow sponge that does not work at all.
It will also be great for him as he gets older and can draw more things.
The magnets are so fun too and so are the different scenery pages.
I'm not sure when the other reviews were written but I just received this yesterday as a gift for me 3 year old son.
and none of the scenery papers were folded.
It works much better!
They were all straight, unfolded in a protective plastic wrap.
I use a big kitchen sponge, wet it and squeeze out most of the water and use that.
There is a great alphabet play that tells you what to draw.

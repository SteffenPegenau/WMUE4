I liked it because it has a rainbow appearance.
Yes, and that is what makes me an expert with Jaguar scissors.
We have them all over Saudi Arabia.
THIS IS A JAM-ON PAIR OF SCIZZORS.
Let me mention on last thing - it cuts through butter like a knife does except with scizzors on hair.
Thanks for your kind reading of many facts and pertin information.
Don't just listen to my expert advice, just buy the scizzors.
BUT IT IS!!!
you take your pick, scizzors and butter is probaly not the winning combination.
I bet the seller even has a no-money back guarantee.
please buy these!
we make your oil pricy, but your scizsors oh so cheap.
Yet it is metal, so it can't be a rainbow.
This is a serious consideration.
did I mention I am from a far away nation.

It's diverse.
That's how I see it anyway.
The only great song towards the end of the album is it's closer, "The Last Song."
"My Paper Heart is awesome too though, as is "Your Star."
Overall, I had to give this cd 4 stars.
This is an awesome start for this band!
I really enjoyed the All-American Rejects' album.
If you enjoy pop-punk, emo, whatever, you should realyl like it, too.
Though it is a tiny bit short at 11 songs, it's awesome.
It makes their music sound more original than many other bands.
The second half of the album falls a bit short.
Techno beats, pianos, orchestral instruments, and the organ (in "Swing Swing") add extra flavor to the album.
I like how they use different elements in their music.
My favorite songs are "Swing Swing," "One More Sad Song," and "The Last Song."
I love those songs.

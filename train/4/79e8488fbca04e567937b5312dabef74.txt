However, if there is a part II to A PAINTED HOUSE, I will be first in line to read it.
Two issues in particular: First, I was expecting a lawyer to appear on the following page.
He constructs a good story and knows how to tell it.A PAINTED HOUSE is different.
His mastery of the word puts readers on the edge of their chairs.
Second, there are many loose ends and unanswered questions with this novel.
However each page I turned, the lawyer never showed up.
I have read ALL of Grisham's works -- even before he was well known.
Although he employs his well-honed mastery of the English language, I didn't like the story.
Well, may be not.
It simply is not what I expected from Grisham.
I like his novels and seek him out.
He is a brilliant writer.
Some people like that, I'm not one of them.
The Chandler family could have used a lawyer.
I found the ending annoyingly abrupt.
This is not to say A PAINTED HOUSE is a bad story.

Until page 250 it was incredible.
I agree to it.
But still it was readible.
I have just finished reading this book.
You would like this.
But still I cannot give five stars.
I only think that Grisham could have made the ending better.
However I slowed down after page 250.
And I don't think if this book can be the best book of 1990's.
I admire John Grisham!
Wow, this was so GOOD.
Because I think five star book deserves everlasting support from the readers.
It was still better than other books.
I read some reviews and all said that the beginning was so good.
But this book surely worth four stars.

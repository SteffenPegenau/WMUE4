Sure, as dozens of reviewers have pointed out, the paper could be better.
The only real qualm I have (other than less than stellar binding) is the price.
You really get a great product.
Seriously, 40 percent discount on the exact same product.
Especially when there are companies out there producing almost exactly the same thing (Piccadilly for instance) for four dollars less.
The product itself is fine.
And, having tried both, I can promise you that it is not.
But the inflated prices have to be taken into account.
Again, I really have no fault with this notebook.
To me, that is the definition of marketing hype.
You get a notebook for 10 bucks.
I admit, I got one to see if the hype was founded.
Let me start off by saying that this is a fine notebook.
Not worth it.
Feel free to waste money on a brand, but if you just want the same quality product, you can go elsewhere to find it.
But the construction is second to none.

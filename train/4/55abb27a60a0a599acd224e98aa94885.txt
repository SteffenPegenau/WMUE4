It looked like the lok nar from that heavy metal movie.
Long live Chameleon gazing balls.
After staring at it for 19 days straight It began to speak to me.
I swear the more I stare at it I believe I can see the future which is me staring at it.
The gazing ball told he it was the last of its kind that the source of its amazing glow was gas.
Human gas.
I personally inspect each and every one for freshness.
He told me that within its magical glass contains the last human fart and that it was mine.
The gazing ball told me that in the future the fda wages war on one of mankinds most noble and inherinte rights.
I cracked the glass breathed in the inspiration and bought the company.
This gazing ball is amazing.
The right to fart.
I had no idea what to do.
It said I was the chosen one and destined to save the world.
The first night I used it scared me.
Then it came to me after eating alot of beans and several burritos.

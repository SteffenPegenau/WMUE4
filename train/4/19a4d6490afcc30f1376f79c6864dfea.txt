Backing looks cheap, so not as cute from behind if turning and moving with the wheels.
That said, once put together, is very sturdy.
Direction for putting together are pictures.
Received with multiple broken pieces, possibly from shipping so kids were disappointed that it couldn't be used right away.
Much easier to put together with two people.
Perfect size for toddlers.
Very thin.
Looks adorable and kids love it.
Would purchase again.
Called the company and the parts were shipped and to us in a couple of days.
Fits a larger doll or two small dolls.
Very short for school age kids.
Can be a bit confusing with which way certain pieces are to be facing.
Very cute doll crib.
Blanket and pillow are not useful.

I used to ask every girl to dance with me in junior high.
There has been a lot of depression in my own life, so this is the music that I thirst for.
It's fun music.
This is a band from Oakland who embrace the sound of New Wave.
I have always been a good dancer.
Maybe they need a good publicist or manager.
I want to dance.
This is a band that could sell out one day, and become really famous, and party with Paris Hilton.
Then Communique would be a household word.
I was a famous once.
All their songs are catchy.
I feel famous again when dancing to Communiqué.
Kids would turn off their Playstations and listen to this fine band.
By the second album, it should be happening.
That is really the goal of all music today.
I feel famous for fifteen people.

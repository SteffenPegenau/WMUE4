When this was released it was met with so much scrutiny they immediately went in and recorded the lackluster "Reactionary".
This is definitley their highlight and most heartfelt release.
That term is so cliche and lame.
I feel like Trever Keith is really throwing everything he has into this!
Highlights: Burden, Heart of Hearts, I Know What You Are, The Devil You Know, Run In Circles *To really show how good this CD is.
Thumbs WAY up!
Never done that before.
A band as good as face to face deserves to put out whatever style sound they want.
It is slower, a little more "emo" maybe.
No joke.
I hate the fact people will diss a band because they stop being so "punk rock".
From losing or ruining my copies of this album I have purchased this in stores 4 totally different times.
Definitley a huge step and a huge risk song-writing wise and I think it paid off brilliantly.
Don't get me wrong, I love the old punk rock Face to Face but this album is just amazing.

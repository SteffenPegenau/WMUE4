Hard on even slightest of bumpy roads.
Hate the pedals as well.
Impressive gears.
54 cm will be a very good fit for medium height riders (5'7 to 5'10).
You can feel the slightest of bumps.
ProsIts very very light and just drove around 15 miles today and rides fast.My bike computer shows I clocked maximum speed of 48mph which is very impressive.
You need to tune the front derailleur properly to slip from low to high and back.
Excellent speed.
Brakes are good only if you can fix them.
Very good sleek tires.
They rarely line up right for you to get your toes into the clipsSummaryGood starting road bike.
I had to take them to a bike shop and get them fixed.
They didn't come fixed for me.ConsAwful seat, Brakes don come fixed with the package and you will struggle to set them right.
I spent decent them tuning them properly.
Its very hard on you if you find a little bumpy road.
Very light.

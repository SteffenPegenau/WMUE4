He's only credited once, and that for the organ.
And one more little gripe.
I just wish there were more of him...I mean Parsons.
Come on!The songs, though, soar.
Call of the Wild and The Very Last Time are quite good.Overall the album is good, though not as good as either Try Anything Once nor On Air.
But it's good, and that's enough with Parsons.
More Alan next time.
I hope that Parsons doesn't waste time bringing his next album out.
Back up singer?
This seems to me mainly an Ian Bairnson/Stuart Elliott piece.
Chris Rainbow as back up singer only.
His good is better than a lot of bands' great.
I also like that Parsons has gotten back to using women on his albums again.
Not that this is bad, not at all, but I mean Alan hardly lifts an instrument here...or so it seems.
Alan is back, and the polish is there.
From the opening (on the American release)The Time Machine Part I and onto the magical Out of the Blue, which for my money is one of the best AP(P) songs ever.
Come on!

All in all, I would not do without it.
It is so convenient now to fix quick meals.
I love how easy it is to clean the plates.
Just let soak for a few minutes or put soap water on the grill while it is hot.
It cooks pork chops, steaks, sausage, bacon, most anything quickly and thoroughly.
Prespraying saves the tephlon.
They are so easy to remove, put in the dishwasher, or suds down right away.
Grill cheese sandwiches are delicious.
Also, cook your meat at high temperature.
I have not used it for waffles yet.
I forgot to tell my daughter this and she cooked something and when I went to clean the plate, it nicked just a bit.
This product sits on my counter ready to use because I use it all the time.
One thing I have found that is important, though, is to always, always, always use some type of oil spray before cooking anything.
I don't care what the manufacturer says.
It keeps the meat juicy.
I really love my new George Foreman Grill.

btw i rented this because John Woo said this was an influence and after watching it i can see why.
The legedary end saved it and brought it all together.
not to say this was bad.
The cinematogrophy was great and i loved the Mexican scenery.
i want to see the original version that must have been a hell of a lot better.
great slow mo death scenes.
it was good.
basically its the gang members vs. 100 mexican guys with guns.
truly a great shoot out and one of the ten best ever put to film, right up there with the climax to A Better Tomorrow 2. its that awesome.
studios must realize that unless there is extra violence we could care less about added dialouge.
i dont.
watch the movie
But the directors cut is way to goddam long.
The acting was very good.
i rented this directors cut and i did like the movie.

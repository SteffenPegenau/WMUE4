I don't want to spoil things for people.
I also wished things could have been explained better at the end.
A must play!
Loved the rain and thunder.
Couldn't wait to get home to play this game on most days.
Wished I could have gave it 5 stars.
Atmosphere was great.
This is an awesome game!
But to sum it up... Great game, great characters, great graphics.
But the people who have finished the game will know what I'm talking about.
If there were a 4 1/2 stars, that's what I would have given this game.
Fans of the Gabriel Knight computer games will enjoy this game.
I enjoyed it very much.
Hence the 4 stars.
At a certain point in the game I did have an idea what was going on.
I wished the game could have went on a little bit longer.
Wished we could have seen more closely at the faces of people when talking to them.
That is all I will say.

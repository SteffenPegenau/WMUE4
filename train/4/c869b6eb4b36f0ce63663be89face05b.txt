I've had countless stories of mean, disrespectfl people.
This isn't a place to argue and take sides and get spastic.
This is prolly one of the best Bratz out on the market.

=)Now, I'm (finally :P) going to talk about the doll.
Believe me.
Enjoy it!

First off, I would like to make a point to all ye Bratz bashers/Bratz basher bashers.
This is a place to give your opinion.
I gave it 4 stars, with no doubt in my mind.
I loff playing with it.

I admit, there's always that user that gets in your face, just let it be.
I promise, keeping a zipped lip pays off.

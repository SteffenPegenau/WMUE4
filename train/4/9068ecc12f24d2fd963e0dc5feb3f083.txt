!Millennia
Ever get that feeling?
I only don't give it five stars so that you can read it and then say: "Why didn't she give it 5 stars?
You'll be up until you finish it.
Ah, I made you want to read it!
I really enjoyed reading this.
The characters are lovely, you really get into the 13 tales included in the book.
The three writers are very talented.
A recomendation: Don't start reading this at night if you plan to wake up early the next day.

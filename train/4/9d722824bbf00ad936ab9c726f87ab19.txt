Works for me!
But it dont come in a retail package.
Works perfect.
Wow its amazing how small a space you can cram 4GB of data into.
Just a working SD card.
And it works great!
I ordered on thursday after 5pm and it was in my mail box the next tuesday before noon.
How cool is that?
You could hide this thing under a fake thumb nail.And you can get larger GB size 16,32,64 GB but it is the same size outside.
For less than $5 with shipping I am amazed at what $5 can still buy.
You will get a first class envelope with no insutions or documents or retail packageing.
You can put alot of data on 4GB.
I dont need the fluff I just wanted the card.
My phone sucked it up like candy, was an easy install.
Music,video,text.
Would be worth 10,15,20 dallars to me retail.
And my win 7 desktop auto created a folder for the phone and a mass strage device.
You cant go wrong for less than $5.
Its a split bulk lot -into 1 unit packaging .

It's a good, entertaining movie, that I would recommend be seen at least once.
It had good action.
But, I was quite surprised.
Is it a bad movie?

Is it a perfect movie?
The history aspects of the film only seemed to add to it.
No.
No.
I didn't think I'd like National Treasure at all.
It kept my interest.
It's definitely an entertaining movie.
I didn't expect much.
Not at all.
Not at all.
I wanted to know what was going to happen next.
Yeah, the plot seems far-fetched, and the characters may seem just a tad cliched (or maybe that's just me...) but really you don't notice very much.

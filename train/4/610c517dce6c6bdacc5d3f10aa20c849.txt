It is more exciting and very educational.
It makes me Frederick Douglass instead of himself.
I like this book because it gave me a picture what he was doing.
They were whipped, slashed, burned, and even killed by their masters.
It brings me to the life of the slaves in the past.
Mostly it was about him and how he lived during the years.
Comparing this book with "Huckleberry Finn", I like this book more.
It talked about the slaves in the 1800's.
Hope you will enjoy this book like me.
Plus it will help you understand history better.Out of ten, I give this book an eight.
When I read this book, it makes me feel like a slave.
The sad part of this story is how the slaves were treated during that time.
The more I read it, the more I liked it.
This narrative book of Frederick Douglass was very interesting.
All the educational books I read in the past, I like this book the best.

I now realize that all of these characters relied on Benton to reaffirm their position in life.
Lucy is stuck in her circumstances and is very needy.
Benton was their safety net.
And now that I have finished this one, I understand the complex personalities.
I have started reading the earlier Kay novels.
Kay has a really bad issue with trust.
He knows well that Kay will never feel the same way, so he completely smitten with jealousy.
Diane and Kay would have been a nice rivarly.
I really like the odd twist of this book.
I think Kay really needs somebody to go toe to toe with.
Dorothy is completely jealous of Kay.
Marino is still in love with his wife and Kay.
I must admit my disappointment with Diane Bray's death.
Her sister is not a very nuturing parent or sister.
The one thing that all these characters have in common, they are all afraid to deal with themselves.

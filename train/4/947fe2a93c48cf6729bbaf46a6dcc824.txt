I don't know if this is Sheryl's best, but it's definitly close.
Sheryl Crow, changed her look for this album, and it was a smart move.
"You're an Original" Another favorite.
It will be playing all over the place, like last year.
"It's so Easy" It's so easy to like this song.Those are some of my favorites.
"Soak up the Sun" - A great tune for the upcoming summer.
Although, I don't listen to every track, everytime I listen to this cd, there are some really good ones.My favorites -"Steven McQueen" - The lryics are not the best for this song, but it's got a good beat, that makes it very catchy.
This too, is catchy.
It's still a great buy.
It allowed her to gain new fans, and to keep her music fresh.
"Safe and sound" I love the chorus, it's my favorite part of the song.
The chorus is great.
And even the filler tracks are pretty good.
Although some of the tracks, are fillers.
This cd is not my all time favorite, but it's very good.

Used it on my last car many times.
Best way to use it is to fill the deep scratches with the product and wipe off the excess level with the surrounding surface before it dries completely.
Once product becomes tacky, polish area with the included liquid.
You won't find these instructions on the package - Personal experience.
I fixed a deep scratch in my fender.
Tiny bit of Scratch X smooths everything out.
Polish with your favorite high quality wax.
Works sort of like colored Bondo.
Let product harden for 24 Hours.
Works for me!!
Great product once you learn how to work with it.
P.S.
Can even be painted and sanded once completely dry.
Works best on dark paint jobs; especially black.
You could not find the scratch unless I show you where it is.

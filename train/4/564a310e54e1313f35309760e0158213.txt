Pepper's fetish.Let go of your Door's debut LP.The Byrds?
What does "Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk" mean?
Give up your Sgt.
The Stones "Satanic Majesties"?
Poseurs.
Not on par by a long shot.
It's more than acid and flowers, it's the embracing of the non-linear, the surreal.As others have pointed out, the soul of this album is the intrumental "Interstellar Overdrive", but that only emphasizes my point, starting with as hard a rock riff as Floyd ever crushed out, leading us through the stars only to bring us back to the beginning, only we don't hear it the same way.
No.
The Who?
Has there ever been a song as willfully silly as "Bike" that didn't appear on a Monty Python collection?
Does it matter?
Probably not.
Mere songbirds.THIS is psychedelia.It doesn't make sense.
It's not supposed to make sense.
Take from it what you will...

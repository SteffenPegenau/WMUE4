I just loved the simplicity of the story, the story-telling, and the unexpected twists and turns it took.
Could I rough it in the wild?
Hey, Great Job Ms. Deveraux!
Well, you already have the summaries.
Made me interested in food science/wild herbs.
What would I do without my modern day cooking conveniences?
But overall, I really became glued to this book from Chapter 1.
Loved the culinary aspect.
My first Deveraux book (based on the ratings/suggestions here), but definitely not my last.
The story never gets boring.
Loved him.
Cole really was addictive.
I felt like I jumped right into the town of Legend and really hated to leave it.
Loved the characters.
Thanks for the recommendations guys.
Loved the time-travel aspect.
Just checked out "A Knight In Shining Armor".
Having lived in Alexandria, Virginia, it was nice to hear about some old stomping grounds mentioned, like Tyson's Corner Mall.
I also agree with some of the readers that a lot of loose ends needed to be tied.

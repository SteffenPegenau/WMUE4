One word of caution: after pressing both buttons, without a discharge by swatting a bug, this unit will retain a charge.
It actually stings!
I give it 4 stars out of 5 only because I had to force 1 of the 2 AA batteries into the holder.
Might have been just my unit.
Very nice white 1/4" spark and noise.
Not sure for how long though.
After I tested it with a finger, I decided I'd try it using a metallic object.
Not a pleasant expierience!!!!
Great product for the price.
HAPPY ZAPPING!
:-)
!Imagine your worst static electricty shock X 100.
ENJOY THE LIGHT SHOW!!!!
I used a small Phillips head screw driver to check whether it would actually produce a spark.
I tested the ZAPPING capability personally, since it's still rather cool here, hence very few bugs.
I purchased this product several weeks ago in anticipation of fly season.
It arrived earlier than the shipping date.

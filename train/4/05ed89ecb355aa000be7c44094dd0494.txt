I was most impressed with the price.
The sound is excellent.
I was looking for 2 players for my two son's rooms.
It has a preset EQ with Pop, Rock, Jazz, and no boost settings.
The unit has a remote, a back light, timer, and will repeat all or a single track on a CD.
I then went back to the tradional CD boomboxes and researched and bought two of these models.
I began the search looking for a CD/MP3 player.
So far, no problems.
The Jazz setting is the best IMHO and gives the music a little kick.
But I found that they all lacked for something.
It is very light and will be in rooms with small boys, so that is a plus.
Disappointed in my Memorex, I looked at Sony and several others.
I got mine for ~$....
This unit has excellent sound for such a small player.
Quite a plus for the little ones who like to hear things over and over again.

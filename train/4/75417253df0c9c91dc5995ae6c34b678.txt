It may be there, but I can't find it.
There is no viewfinder.
It may not bother you, but I like that feature.
Long power life, quick flash recharge.
Color is pretty accurate.
If you want zoom power, this is one of your choice.
It has 10x optical zoom.
You can take multiple shoot with one button.
Not bad.
It is not big deal here as the lens are big for the zoom power.I just took it to a 8 days cruise and I had 3 GB of pictures and videos!
You can even use it as a video camcorder with its zoom power.
Although the size is a little bigger, it is worth it.
Lens cap is not auto.
You can do much more than a regular 3x "palm" size point and shoot.
Yes, this Panasonic do all jobs.
Very easy to use.There are few things I don't like.
There is no time stamp function.
You probably don't need it coz its 2.5 in LCD is big enough for you to see what you need.
Quality is super, it has sound too.

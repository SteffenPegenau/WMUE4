I'll be sticking with this paper for a long time.
The whiteness is a bit on the yellow side, but not bad.
Prints dry very quickly and are ready to trim within a minute.
If this did not happen, I'd trash this paper, but thankfully, that is not the case.
Weight (290 gsm) is perfect.
Prints tend to the warm side if I use it.
I've used Canon papers and Konica (currently out of the business).
Color is great.
This is very good paper for most types of printing.
I have no complaints about it.
The ink sets in well, with no pooling, or other bad effects.
I get consistently good results that very nearly match the image on my monitor.
However, I can't seem to get good results using Ilford's icc profile.
Instead, I have a calibrated monitor, and I use Canon's printer driver software.
I use a Canon i9900 printer with dye-based inks and needed a good 'luster' finished paper for some portrait work I do.

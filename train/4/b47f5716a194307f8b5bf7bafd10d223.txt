we feel bad for lisa.
can carole possibly tell a story about herself without horses?
we think this one was great.
we liked carole's story the best though.
yuck!!!
Lisa's story was good but, CHARM SCHOOL!!!
( it doesn't include the names.)
hi us and are best friend are the stable club.
she says shes talking about a dog, but guess what it really is?!
remember, horses ALWAYS rule!!!!!!!
if you want to talk horses, then e-mail us at the address above.
!
you probably know, i mean after all carole can't possibably tell a story of her life that doesn't have at least one horsey part in it!!!!
we read alot of bonnie's books.
Deborah askes the saddle club to tell her a story about each of them without horses!
come on she's only 8yrs old!!
well we liked stevie's story.
charm school!

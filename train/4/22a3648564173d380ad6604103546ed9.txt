I actually was interested in it because of God of War II, in which there is a battle against the main character of this movie.
I definately recommend this one to anybody interested in Greek mythology.
Clash of the Titans.
The only real complaint i have is, i guess with the title.
It is referring to Medusa and the Kraken.
For it's time it's got good acting and writing.
Since this film is from the year 1981, naturally, the first thing one would notice would be the special effects.
But other than that one relatively minor statement, it's a good film.
But if you can look past the special effects, you would realize this film is actually quite decent.
Both of which are in fact NOT TITANS.
They are humorous at best.
So the title makes no sense at all.
They refer to the two of them as titans, when they are not.
However you want to [legally] obtain it, it's not a bad film at all.
It's worth a download, a rental, or a purchase.

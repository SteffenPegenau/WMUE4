lolMy only complaint about the movie -Whoever was in charge of editing or adding music to scenes went overboard.
But it is too much.
I do not dispute it.
Who needs commentary and other stuff for a film like this any way?
Geeez, it is too much and takes away from the movie.
The movie is wonderful.
I know they are trying to "take you back" to that time period and give you the feel.
Really good selections.
The other reviews will tell you so.
This wide screen package was an excellent purchase.
They just tried to jam to much music in.
It is not jammed full of unnecessary stuff and sucker items to make you purchase it.
All the music is great!
At times, you will hear maybe 7 different 'period' songs in the same amount of minutes!!!!
lol
At times it felt like a Time/Warner infomercial for songs of the 70s!!!!

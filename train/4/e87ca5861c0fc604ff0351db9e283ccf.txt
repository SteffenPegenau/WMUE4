I bought a 6 week supply.
If anything I had to take a fiber supplement.
I have reduced my fat intake.
With all the negative reviews about Alli treatment affects I decided to write my review.
This is a major improvement for me.
In all I have about 50 pounds to lose.
Will I stop using Alli?
No.
We are warned that this is not a magic pill.
I am hoping together with my motivation and Alli's help I can lose weight.
My calorie intake is about 1400 calories a day.
I eat what I want.
Was I hoping for more results from Alli?
I have been taking Alli for 1 week and have not experienced any treatment effects at all.
I will stick it out.
I have increased my activity level to about 20 minutes a day at least 5 days a week.
If I lose between 10-20 pounds within the 6 weeks I will continue to use Alli.
So far I think I may have lost 2 pounds.
Alright Amazon readers I will keep you posted.
Yes.

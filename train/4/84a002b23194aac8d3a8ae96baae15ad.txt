(Lisa, Carole, and Stevie)
Keep writing B.B., cause we'll keep buying!
I am writing this with my two friends, Michelle and Stacey.
Don't forget the horses, or Ben Marlow.
Please!!!!
We're from Canada, so it'd be really cool if Carole , Stevie, Lisa (and maybe Alex) could take a trip and come 'up here'.
I think you should bring back the horse-stuff into Pine Hollow, but that doesn't mean I don't like how they are growing up.
And viewers, if you want to send in your opinion, be nice!
Krysta, Michelle, and Stacey.
We all love the Saddle Club, and now Pine Hollow!
Anyways, thanks for writing, we love it!
Way to go, Bonnie Bryant!
Tell us what's happening with A.J.!
One thing though, could you please have Stevie and Lisa being involed at the stable, cause it's not just Carole who is horse-crazy!
We all ride together near Toronto, Ontario.

The 30 minutes really flew by!
Lots of lunges and leg work, I hate lunges with a passion and really dread them, but somehow he makes them bearable.
Music was good and not at all cheesy, so that helps.
But it isn't really annoying, just funny if you stop and listen.
I think.
Wow!
The first workout was Bum Bum and it was fast paced, think it will take a couple of times to master the moves, but I already feel it.
He sounds a lot like Borat from those movies, it makes me laugh and smile when I hear him talk.
Do this 5 times a week and watch what you put in your mouth and there is no way you won't see results.
Can't wait to update this review after a week or two.
The instructor, Leandro?
I have only done one of the workouts in this set, I just recieved it yesterday.
But he does talk alot and cues you to keep everything tight.
I look forward to updating this review to tell you if it's true or not!
It looks and feels like it really targets the butt.

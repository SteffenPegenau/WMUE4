But some songs always make me cry like "Always There."
It's the saddest of them all.
I have seen all 6 movies and I like all of them except the first one.
It always makes me cry.
Amazing!
I want a seventh movie!
Prodigious!
The waterworks were on!
Hinting on the next movie...
Hinting from the first movie when LittleFoot reflects about his mother.
Once I saw that movie, BAM!
When I mean sad, I mean crying sad.
In that song, LittleFoot and his friends reflect on their parents.
He has a nice imagination.
My little brother imagines that the last movie will be when the asteroid hits the earth and sometime cavemen come!
The land before time is appearing in commercials.

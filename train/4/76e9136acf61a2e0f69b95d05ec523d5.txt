Deep Dwarfs came in and dug under a lake.
After I read a lot of these reviews I noticed a lot of people have said that there are Empty rooms?
To judge a book because it lacks these three items is just wrong.
The basic's, a prison had an earthquake that cracked the walls.
Wow I found a spear next level I will Weapon Focus.
Gosh what a shocker it fell into the prison!
Really?
No treasure?
As far as plot goes there is plenty!
Typo's its 840pgs and 6 lb so reprints were kind of hard on the check book.
An aftershock caused a whole forest to fall 600ft into the prison, and the 2 titan's guarding the front and back were killed by giants and treasure seekers.
Heavy DM modification?
Judging a product because it's a prison with no slot machines or a deck of many things is sad.
So build a knife, get a stick of wood (club) or play as a group of adventures that got sent to Ah, prison (Duh).
It's a Prison!

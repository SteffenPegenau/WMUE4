Get Live At The Regal or Live In Cook County Jail before this.
I hate to give a B.B.
His heart is not in it at all.
Jones, at all.
Having said that, the rest of the CD is really good.
It seems like a song that B.B.
King collections out there than this one, but it still has some really good stuff (Don't Answer The Door is awesome!)
There's even a nice instrumental which showcases B.B.
It's some cheesy dance tune, from a movie soundtrack.
Several King classics are here like Don't Answer The Door, Paying The Cost To Be The Boss and Sweet Sixteen.
King CD any less than five stars, but not every song on this CD is great.
Overall, I think there are much better B.B.
was required to perform.
I did not like track number 3, The B.B.
's guitar nicely.

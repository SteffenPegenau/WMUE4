Of course a few of Tolkiens subplots are sacrificed but not out of disrespect.
Great acting, action, cinematography.
The films simply do not convey what powerful and menacing creatures they are in the books.
The truth is that you'll be closet fans of the films right to your graves.Now the bad news.
The great quandry of an epic film is to sacrifice acting for effects.
The attention to detail is mind boggling.
Remember how you felt watching The Shining or The Excorcist?Can't wait for ROTK.
They simply would not help the film.
Jackson has missed with the Nazgul (ringwraiths).
The film does not make the viewer fear them.
For all you Tolkien purists...you just need to b**ch about something!
Great Film!
First the good news.
Their very presence sapps the presence of being from any mortal within proximity.
Jackson has held true to the characters as well as the main story.

Fresh Azimiz - 4.5/55.
Go - 2/59.
Like You - 4/57.
[Lil'] Bow Wow is back, but is it his best?
Hooking back up with J.D.
was clearly a wise move, from a production point of view, and Bow Wow still can put it down on the mic, however, he seems like he still hasn't "found" his style.
- 3/58.
Do What It Do - 3/510.
B.O.W.
Caviar - 3/56.
To be fair, Bow Wow is clearly in caught in the difficult process of "jumping" from the teeny bopper realm to the adult realm.
Is That You (P.Y.T) - 3/511.
Let Me Hold You - 5/54.
Do You - 3/52.

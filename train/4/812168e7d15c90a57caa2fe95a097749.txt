It just so happened when I was doing an on-line search that I came across Guy Sebastian and Shannon Noll.
Shannon has a new fan in the States!
I was curious so I ordered this CD and Beautiful Life by Guy.
Too many of the American contestants are R&B singers.
Shannon has that little scratch to his voice that I love!
Great Great Great!
More than Guy's CD actually.
The whole Idol series is about finding undiscovered talent.
I will definitely buy his next CD!
I can't stop listening to it.
As a previous review stated - Shannon does pop/country-esque songs.
I really really like this CD a lot.
He looks hot and sounds great.
His rendition of What about Me is super as well!
Learn to Fly is just a fab song.
I am a fan of American Idol, of course.
About time there was an Idol - somewhere - that does some pop.

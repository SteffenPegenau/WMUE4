It does keep accurate time now.
The buzzer is my only real complaint, and the dual alarm settings are a plus.
I have it set to radio with the volume most of the way up.
For a budget alarm clock it works well.
I do this just in case the station is off the air, then the static will wake me up.
That is the plus.
The clock has a time zone setting to automatically adjust the time.
The clock is very basic as far as options go.
My Citizen Eco-Drive watch is extremely accurate to the last second and the alarm clock was a couple of minutes off, even with the auto adjust.
The buzzer alarm is horrible.
It uses a fob battery instead of a 9volt.
I am not a real heavy sleeper but I don't trust it to wake me up.
Now that doesn't happen since they are on the opposite sides.
Settings are very easy to navigate.
The reason I bought this clock is my wife would accidentally turn of my alarm when she turned hers off, due to the fact the switches where so close together.

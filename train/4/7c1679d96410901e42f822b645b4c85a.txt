Yep, and they will, but for now, I'm happy to have a small, light, easy to use phone that does most things pretty well.
It is thin enough to rest in my front pants pocket without feeling like I've got a hummer in there.
The body is tough and seems like it will last a good long time.
The camera works great in a pinch.
Could they improve it?
I hardly ever get a dropped call, 2.
If I wanted to take "real" pictures, I would have a "real" camera with me.
I can see the screen-all the time.
I've owned several phones and this one excels in most of the "real world" applications, such as: 1.
4. no antenna sticking out, need I say more?
7.
6. menu is easy to navigate.
3.
5.
So, all in all, it does what it should without any major annoyances.
Geez, all this angst about what the razr does and doesn't do.

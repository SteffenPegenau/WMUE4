After about 3 years it would not heat constantlty.
This was my second Rowenta Iron.
I loved the way they ironed when they worked!!!
Thought it was short in the cord but couldn't find anything wrong with that.
Thought that explained why it didn't last very long.
The problem is mine not theirs.
I contacted Rowenta about the problems I've had and all they said was they don't guarntee products after 90 days.
thinking it would last for many years.
!
So be careful when spending a lot on money on their so called professional line.
Didn't buy a very expensive one at first.
I did like the way it perfomed so I purchased a DM880 model.
Not pleased with response from ROwenta.
The plastic dial fell off and broke, unable to adjust temp.
Told me how to store the cord which in fact I purchased a special clamp for the cord when I bought the iron.

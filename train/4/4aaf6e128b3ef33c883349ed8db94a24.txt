The jam n' shread pen!!!
And a nice cute little feather pen??
What kind of TOY pen costs 10 bucks!
This journals pen compartment was FORMED EXCATLY to fit that pen.
Nope, the feathers get squashed in the diagonal crossover.
?I dont know!!!Hey!
Ok, thanks for reading and i hope this helps.
So what does fit in this journal??
By Girl Tech.
I do know!!!
But the pen itself costs $9.99!
Not one that Im going to buy.
Pencils dont work unless they are shorter and older.
Wait a minuite!!!
What bothers me is that it is to short of a space to keep a gel pen, because you would have to keep a gel pen wiuthout the lid.
One thing i forgot to mention that really bothers me about this journal is the space to keep your pens and pencils.
Because if you put in a new pencil, it wouldnt fit.
Hi im 13, and i wrote another review on this journal.

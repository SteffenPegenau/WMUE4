My only gripe is that the author chose to write the novel in 1973 which makes the novel seem obsolete in certain ways.
For people who did not understand the book I think its more of a lack of imagination.
The writing is mature, eloquent and at times funny.
Even more so the characters bumping into historical figures.
I finally read it and gobbled it up in 3 days!!
But I do think that it does lack something...Like why Cat was the chosen one?
Very creative.
I also found Lily and Carioca my favorite characters!
I personally enjoyed the toggling of past to present.
Needless to say I enjoyed the book for what it is..entertainment.
Like no cell phones, email or even normal mail.
I had to remind myself several times about this fact.
I received this book as gift for Mother's Day.
Who the heck is she anyway???
It was that good.
This is not for the faint of heart though.
But overall it is an enjoyable read.

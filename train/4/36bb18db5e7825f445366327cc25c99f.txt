"Pac with an East Coast Bop" and thats why you should go buy all of his cds.
AZ is brilliant on every bar.
But I digress.
So dude was right don't buy that, Buy AZ.
Royal Salute with the shot at 50 is great.
AZ is the most slept on rapper in NY and I think he is the best.
I can't believe 50 took a cheap shot at AZ.
But it comes close.
I just listened to Jay-Zs album and it is terrible.
Its expected.
This album is not as nice as A.W.O.L.
But buy Nas too because I herd some tracks from that and they are nice.
This album is damn good but I think these guys are hyping it a bit.
This album is definatly worth the 12 dollars it costs.
His features are decent, I only point this out because if he spit a verse instead of them it would make the songs even better.

May be a tad heavy for little ones, but my view, again, was to have something that they could use and enjoy for years to come, with no catastrophic accidents.
I did try the coin release on the belly and it is difficult .
Received the pigs in very good order.
.
They had been given two large, ceramic pigs as gifts that she will not use because they're breakable.
I haven't deposited coins yet so don't know how that will be.
.
I bought them for a friend's twins' 1st birthday, coming up in May.
Not a spot on either one of them.
Very pleased, and very pleased with Amazon.
I will try the cotton balls in the legs suggestion, as it does seem as if coins will get lodged in there.
I thought this would be the perfect piggy for the twins to "grow into."
but if a parent has to help, so be it.
She is going to regift them.
Overall, I am satisified and hope they will be too.

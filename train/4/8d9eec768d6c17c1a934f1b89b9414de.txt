Its an opener, a good one.
The series is promising and good.
But not like the Carpathian books.
Like all the other Feehan fans, I love the Carpathian series.
Well, its not.
"New" being the key word.
Lily is a sweetheart and Ryland is a good man.
I love the rest of the team and will keep reading this series.
Its got its suspense and then was so funny I was laughing out loud.
Some people read this thinking it would be like those books, and disappointed because its not.
I thought this was a good first book for a new series.
It has a good story line, hot like Feehans books are and it gives you a good idea of how the series is going to go on.
I have read the second book too, Mind Game and thought it was a good continuation of the Ghostwalker story and loved Nicolas and Dahlia.
They are addicting in their own way.
The book is a good beginning book.

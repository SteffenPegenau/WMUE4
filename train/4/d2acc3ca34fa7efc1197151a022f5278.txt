They call her Cousin Eunice.
So now there are three problems.
How are they going to get there?
They only have $11.00 and a long way to go.
If not ,will Cousin Eunice take them back?
It's about four kids who get abandoned by their mother at a big mall.
Also food is a BIG problem!
So soon they find out that they have a Grandma who lives in Crisfeild, MD.
If you really what to know ,read the book "Homecoming."
Soon Dicey (the 13 year old and oldest) thinks that they can`t stay because the youngest kid (Sammy) keeps getting in trouble.
Plus is their grandma going to like them and let them stay?
I hope you like the book!
They were on their way to their {rich}Aunt Cilla's house that is by the ocean in Bridgeport, CT.
So they are stuck with Aunt Cilla's daughter.
The book Homecoming is a really good book.
When they get to Bridgeport they find out that her house is not by the ocean, she is not rich, and she is not even alive!

I stumbled upon this book.
Truley the end was unsatasfactory.
Her life was not yet stable.
One never knows.
And now we come to one of the biggest problems it just seemed more juevenile then the previous books.
So, I'm going to try the next McGraw novel in hopes that it lives up to my expectations.
"Mara" was a lot ot live up to and this novel fell sort.
The history part was good too.
Naturally I ran to the library to find all of the Eloise McGraw books possible.
Will the Golden Goblet be Satisfactory?
Here problems weren't really solvered.
Juliana found here nitch in life while embodering the tapestry, but when it was over, then what was she to do.
Yeah, it was beleivable and the charactors were good.
But where is the suspense, the intrigue?
Yeah, so I read "Mara Daughter of the Nile" and LOVED it.

And he pioneered the good bad guy.
But it is well worth viewing.
Audie Murphy.
With his boyish looks it is difficult visionlizing Murphy as a cold blooded western killer until you remember this guy probably single handedly killed more men in WWII than any other man.His real life was tragic probably reflecting his mental scars from the war.
Do not be misled.
Real good.
Apache Rifles is not his best western.
But murphy pulled it off.
To me growing up was movies on saturday with a western starring Audie Murphy.
His remake of the James Stewart classic, Destry, was gutsy.
Take a good look at just one Audie Murphy movie and suddenly you're hooked.
But on the screen in a western or even in Red Badge of Courage his performances are compelling.
No he wasn't John Wayne.
And some may say he only made B-westerns.
This guy was good.
World War II.s most decorated soldier (see to hell & back).

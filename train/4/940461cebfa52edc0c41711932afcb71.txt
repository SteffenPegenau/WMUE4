They are 1 and 1/2 the width of my Shuffle.
Think portable radio (do they still make those?).
I would recommend these to people who need very portable speakers.
Not the best sounding music, but it's better than no music.
I work all over the place.
Audiophile, not even close.
I don't have an office.
I am in front of a computer all day at work.
You can connect your shuffle and put the whole thing into a shirt pocket with lots of room left over.
I figured I would buy a small set of speakers.
What to do?
Well I got them!
These speakers are really small!
They tell me I can't wear headphones, but I can listen to music.
Well, I figured why not try them.
I have to say I am surprised how much sound comes out of them.

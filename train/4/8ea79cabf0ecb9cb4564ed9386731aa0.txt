However, the visual aid is very helpful.
What I mean is, they aren't even Japanese scenes.
My dictionary arrived yesterday.
I remember another comment about a man having a Japanese wife who says,"They have words that people don't even use anymore."
Like who's wears a "Top Hat" anymore?
These are American scenes with Japanese words under them.
XD XDBrings back memories.
I remember the same pictures from my childhood with the Spanish dictionary.
Same pictures and everything.
It would be nicer if they were Japanese pictures instead of American pictures.
It is the exact same pictionary from back when I was learning Spanish XD It is EXACTLY the same.
<3 However, Although it wins points memory wise.
I don't think you are going to need "movie projector" or "spinning wheel."
The ONLY difference is everything's in Japanese instead of Spanish.
But it is the EXACT same thing except that part.
But the artist is very lazy.
A lot of the vocab, you don't need.
That is true.

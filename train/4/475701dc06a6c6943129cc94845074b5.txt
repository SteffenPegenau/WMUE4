Easy software to uploads videos.
However, compared with iPod, the sansa player feels a little bit coarse.The goods:.
Headphones could be betterSansa e250 is a QUITE good mp3 player.
The interface could be better.
It's a good opponent to the ipod nano if you don't have enough money to buy one of those.
The volume wheel is completely mechanic, then your thumb works out spinning the wheel.. Software to upload mp3 does not have as many features as the iTunes has.
Price.
Memory expansion.
You could record the radio.
File system do not scramble your mp3 files and folders (just read them however you upload to it).
It comes with a small but useful case (to avoid scratchs).
Sansa player looks quite robust and durable.
The screen is brighter and is quite easy to use, the interface intend to be iPod like.
SizeThe bads (that is because I didn't put 5 stars).
You could record directly from the microphone.

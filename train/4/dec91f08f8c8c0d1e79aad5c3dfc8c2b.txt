Good actor as well.
This is a very good Tosca.
The ochestral sound is quite thrilling in DTS.
Probably that best Tosca one could hope for today.
They have made Scarpia a church figure although what kind is hard to say.
But at least nothing interferes with this wonderful performance.
You never do get a good glimpse of Scarpia's palace.
But the show belongs to Raimondi who exudes evil and menace as Scarpia.
Certainly a cardinal or bishop would not wear pants but a surplice.
Benini gives us a fairly slow performance which allows us to luxuriate in Puccini's melodies.
Her real life husband Armiliato is very good.
The settings are quite dark.
The production is on the lame side.
Where has this man been hiding?
Dessi is a little shrill but otherwise good and a good actor.

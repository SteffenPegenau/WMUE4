Great big watch.
Was given this watch as an xmas gift.
It occasionally stops overnight.
My only complaint may have more to do with me than with the watch.
Could be because of my sedentary lifestyle.
Well constructed case and band.
Date cyclops eye magnifies well and is easy to read.
Simply knocked over.
Kept time to within fifteen seconds per day (fast) out of the box, and has settled down to about ten seconds fast per day.
Details on face are crisp, wings on second hand are crisp.
The Polex was humming along just fine until I dropped it about thirty inches to a hardwood floor.
The impact appears to have been beyond its design/engineering limits.Wonder what would happen with the Invicta.
Easy to read face.
Big yellow box.
I'm no longer driving much during the day.This watch replaced a replica Rolex (nick-named the "Polex" by one of my sons) that I picked up in Thailand.

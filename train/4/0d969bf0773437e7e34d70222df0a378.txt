If you are a person that likes suspense, this is a good book for you.
It is just a very good book.
He hears music, and falls in love with a princess and he is thrown in a dungeon.
Everytime when it goes back it's confusing.
I recommend this book to 6th graders and up, because it's confusing, but still a good book.
They sneak onto a tray and get out of the dungeon.
He is named Desperaux because he is a disapointment.
Mig helps Roscuro kidnap the princess and.... read more to find out!
In the beginning when it first goes back in time it's really confusing.
He has huge ears and a tiny body.
This book is about a mouse.
They meet a serving girl named Mig.
!I give this book 4 stars.
When he is born all of his brothers and sister die.
He meets a rat named Roscuro and a prisoner named Gregory.

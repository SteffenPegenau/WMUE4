Eddie doesn't feel like his life was worth anything.
If you try to compare it against typical Christian theology, you will be disappointed.
Actually, at just under 200 pages, it is a one day read.
But, none the less, the book is compelling and entertaining.
It is not theologically sound that way.
Enjoy it, I did!
I'm pretty sure that would not happen.
If you're looking for a quick feel-good book, this is it.
He meets five people in Heaven that show him otherwise.Good weekend read.
He is in his 80's, it is his birthday, and, of course, he dies.
Without a doubt, this book will keep you entertained.
At times it is touching, as well.The main character is Eddie.
Example - the main character swears in Heaven a few times.
Read it as entertainment and not a book about what Heaven will really be like.
He doesn't feel like he accomplished anything or used his full potential.

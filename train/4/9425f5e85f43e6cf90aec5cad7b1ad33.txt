By the way, I bought this toy yesterday at Target for $9.00.Edited:This plane is very durable.
The little people included are still in great shape.
Since my grandson is older, it does not get much play time.
It has been banged on so many times.
He's too young to play with it now.
My granddaughter has played with it at times also.
I bought this for my grandson.
It's been almost three years now since buying the plane.
Right now, his interest lies more with dinosaurs and cars.
I did see him playing with it one day, which I was surprised.
I gave this a four star because its so adorable.
When shown to him, his eyes and smile lit up to the sounds of the plane.
The product does state up to three years old.
Hopefully when he's older, this toy will be played with alot.
The music still plays, and aside from some minor marks, the plane looks good.

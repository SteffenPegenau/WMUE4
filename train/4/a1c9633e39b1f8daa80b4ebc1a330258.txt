Since she turned 3 months old, now she is 1 year old, she loves it and it is a must have.
She seemed to be on her own schedule regardless of her surroundings.
The back is helpful now that she is one year she cannot turn it off as easily and fall asleep.
It works for adults too.
And she often claims she can never sleep.
The first 3 months the Sleep Sheep did not seem to make a huge difference.
:)
It is so soothing and nice--better than a CD player, snugglier and portable.
Now, we can't travel without it!
Actually, we had visitors the other day and my best friend fell asleep to the sleep sheep in our bed to the monitor that was still turned on from the night before during baby's nap time, my best friend seemed in a coma I could not wake her up!
She loved it so much she wanted to take it home.
I put it in the car on trips, etc.
I fall asleep to it too on the monitor.
I turn it on the ocean wave sound.
It is helpful to time it to her nap and goodnight time.

It said it was coming out on March 27th 2003.
I am sooooo excited to get it when I am free.
But all of a sudden, I had this interest on the sims games.
You'll be glued to the T.V......
I asked some of my friends about this game.
Please guys, get this game!
They said that it was better than the computer sims games.
And I kept on going down and down and BOOM!!!
(They have PS2) They it was the best sims game that was evr invented!
I go on amazon.com everyday and check on XBOX games all te time.
So I searched for, the sims!
You'll have one heck of a time!
Ever I always wanted this game.
It was like a dream come true!
I saw it on Januay 29th.
There I saw The Sims for XBOX!!!

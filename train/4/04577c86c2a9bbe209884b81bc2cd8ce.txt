However, the first time I did it I got so frustrated, I kicked the couch.
The more YOU PUT INTO IT the MORE YOU GET OUT!
I love this DVD.
That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
I finally went and took a Saturday morning to take the time to learn all the moves by constantly rewinding.
I sweat a lot to this!
It gets me in such a good mood!
It paid off.
It does become mush easier as time goes on...give it time!
Stick with it!!
Let it go a little, and you will feel the sweat!
I would suggest actually watching this workout through before attempting.
Since doing this workout, I have added on another 2 dance workouts without much trouble.
(That is something I NEVER do...but I wished I had with this one!)
Once you master one, the others don't take as much time (with the exception of "Dance of the Inches"--still having trouble with that one!I love the choreography...love the instructor (just picked up her Prevention dance workout).

(A cameo appearance by Drizzt would've completely made this story!)
Imoen didn't join the party in the beginning.

Others...The book is worth reading, the love between Abdel and Jaheira well written, but a few important things (to me, anyway,) were left out.Ash
Here are a few examples:1.
Where's Xan's Moonblade?
Abdel should have run away from the original fight, not fought in it, also mentioning that Sarevok should have been in the original fight with Tamoko.
The story is solid, the characters true, and the consistency memorable.The only thing about this book I don't like is the lack of important events or people from the game mentioned in the book.

Where's the doppelgangers impersonating everyone under Candlekeep?
Everyone knows you can really summon Drizzt.
This novelization of Baldur's Gate is fantastic!
Where's Drizzt?
Where's Elminster on the way to The Friendly Arms and going into Baldur's Gate?

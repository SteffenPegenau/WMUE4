Not great, not bad, but good.
I'm kinda sick of readin all these reviews sayin how it's not as good as their old stuff or there are too many guests.
As for the record.
Theres also only like 2 or 3 "skits" out of 17 tracks which is good (I can't stand albums where like half the material are skits).
If you like hip-hop from '89 your old.
Good.
Overall it's got fresh beats and is a good listen and worth having in your collection.
It's not like theres only 3 cuts and then i take the cd out.
If you like their old stuff you gotta be 30 years old.
Like many said there are a handful of standout tracks but the others are still listenable.
"Newer" hip-hop started around the time of The Chronic.
I can listen to almost the whole thing.
Thats not really a dis but it's true.
period.
The beats from then are different from the mid to late 90's and i think you would have had to grow up then to like stuff from then.
Thats when the beats started changing to what the kids listen to today.

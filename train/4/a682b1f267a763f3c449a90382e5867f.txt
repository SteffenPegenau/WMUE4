Cleans under the bed!!!
Does a really good job cleaning.
If you have throw rugs that are not too thick or have the frills on the edge invest in some carpet tape or Velcro and attach them to the floor.
I was very pleased.
It does get confused by the kitchen table sometimes.
I know some models are not so good.
I invested in an extra battery which helps.
Wohoo.
It will not work on thick carpet either.
I was a little worried on this purchase.
Not very noisy.
Battery life is not very good on carpet also.
Word of caution you really do need to dump the dust bin and clean the filter after ever use.
The only thing bad I can say is it does not like throw rugs especially if the have frilly edges.
Otherwise the rumba tends to pull up the rug and get stuck.
Overall I was very pleased.I'm Jack and I give this little robot a thumbs up.

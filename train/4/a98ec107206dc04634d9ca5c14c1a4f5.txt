Most of the cribs in that price range come with conversion kit.
Received this crib as a gift and it is wonderful!
Not a big deal however, that makes the price of the crib upwards of 300.00.
NO, none that I have found are compatable to use with a crib.
Went to BRU and was told the conversion kit is 60.00.
All in all it is a good crib for the money.
I was not told an additional piece was required to convert this bed.
Not a big deal right?
The only 2 problems I have are that the crib doesnot convert to a toddler bed it converts to a daybed.
Very stlyish without a hefty price tag.
Like the fact that it converts.
Just by a bed safety rail and attach it to the crib.
Very easy to put together and extremely stable.
Also, the conversion into a full size bed..
Never had a problem with the side not dropping down to get my son in or out.

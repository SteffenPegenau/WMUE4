I enjoyed TEKWAR so much that I thought I see is Shatner and friends could do it 2 in a row.
then maybe cardboard does bother you when everything is good.
Did you like Twister?
A lot of critics don't think much of SW books either.Read tek war first.
Shatner does it again.
This is episode 2 of 9, that I know of.
did!
All I care is that the final product is excellent.Jake, Gomez and Beth investigate a virus that is related to Tek and Jake naturally suspects the Tek Lords.
You may find this shocking but I also like Star Wars.
The first 5 have been read and they are fast paced, humorous and fun.Wow.
But I liked the movie TWISTER, and the critics said this was a bad movie because of its cardboard characters.
They (he?)
I don't know if Shatner really wrote these or not.
As far as cardboard character comments are concerned, they may be for some.
If you like it, try Tek Lords.
The other reviews here are tough.
Do you like fast paced mysteries set in a futuristic world?

A big plus - no psycho killer.
Well, a lot of people seem to be a bit disappointed in LH's Open Season.
.a western, PLEASE.
However, he grew on me and the story had a lot of humor and action.
.
Once agin LH .
His initial description/introduction didn't exactly grab me.
Let's face it.
No it's not as good as Mr.
Perfect, but it's worth your time.
Usually LH's heros are to die for from the beginning until the end.
It's not as bad as some of the reviews lead you to believe - and it's not as good as a lot of her other books.
My only problem with the book was the hero.
Since it is LH, I can't give her anything less than a four because I LOVE her books.
Just about every book you pick up has a psycho killer in it.

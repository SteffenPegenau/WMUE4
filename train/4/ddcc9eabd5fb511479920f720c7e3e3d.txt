But of course read them even if the movie isn't out yet or out for a while!
BUT i recommend for EVERYONE, if they haven't already read the other ones, to READ THEM!
and of course we must remember (sigh/roll eyes) that this book will be great in theaters!
This book is truly a great book but the only problem is in the book you can't believe some one would do a certain thing or believe something that would be best kept a secret!!!
HARRY POTTER IS THE BEST!!
But besides those... GO OUT AND GET THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVEN'T!!!
I thought for sure that this book would be even longer because every book the length is atleast a little bit longer.
I assure you!
!-THE HARRY POTTER FANATIC!!
It is a great book and the only other turndown is how short it is.
The fifth book was fun to read because it just kept going on and on.
THEN go and see the movie!
You're going to love this book!
!
ITS SO MUCH FUN TO READ!

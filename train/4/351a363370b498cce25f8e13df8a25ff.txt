Both areas have not had any 'kitty gifts' since we applied both products.
We're so happy.But, then we started getting cats pooping in our mulch!
It looks so nice!
But, it works.
Drives me batty.This product works great for what we need it for.
On top of the paper, we laid down black mulch.
Earlier this summer, we updated our front yard.
Not nice.We used the Critter Ridder on half the area.
Then we'd have to clean it up.
GROSS!!
No poop, but they still make a mess for us to clean up.
On the other half we sprayed vinegar.
It's a 5 star product for us, but I took away a star because it's so darn expensive!
They would come and mess up the mulch and do their thing.
The beautiful effect to the whole front of the house is huge.
The one big difference between the areas: the cats still come and move the mulch around in the vinegar area.
We put in new flowering plants and covered the dirt with special paper to help deter the weeds from growing.
Yuck...

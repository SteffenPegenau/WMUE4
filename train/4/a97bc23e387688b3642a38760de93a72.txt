Eric just was a very awful man with problems within his self.
I have never been in abusive situation.
Then when Ruth finally got out of the situation with Eric (husband), and finally got the nerve to meet someone, Adrian walks in here life, then out.
Get the book!
Poor Ruth, she was just his punching bag.
I felt so sorry for Ruth, but Adrian had nerve.
But after reading this book I finally got the answer.
But I have known people that have been.
I understand he wanted to be a father to his child, but there are other ways to handle the sistuation.
You always ask, "Why do you stay?"
Something to think about.
I don't know if I could had forgiven Adrian and took him back or not.
Things he done was very uncalled for.
This was a good book regarding abusive relationship.
How can you claim you love someone and treat them badly like he did.
I think he was just being selfish there.

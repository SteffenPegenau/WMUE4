I mean, I know she had to die sometime.
What, I don't know... To be honest, I didn't really care about Rayford's life before the rapture.
Her end was not very exciting and did not live up to the expectations I had.
Don't buy it first.
The narrative followed her own personal and spiritual journey, through thick and thin, for about 200 pages (or so).
Then she died.
And that was pretty much the only thing the book had to offer after that.
And it was over.
I was involved in her life like you would not believe.
Anyway, its a pretty good book.
Get it from the library if you haven't read it yet.
For a while.
For a while, THE RISING was one of the better books I had decided to pick up.
I was dissapointed by the inconsequential death of Marilena Carpathia, mother of the Antichrist.
But something was missing.
And she was the reason.

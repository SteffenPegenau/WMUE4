This is also the last album they did with Greg Stefani (the founding member) before he left the band.
Make No Doubt a real band again.
Instead, get "Tragic Kingdom."
I guess you would call this "Ska" music, but it's just great alternative rock.
Let Gwen do her horrid duets with Eve and Moby.
"You know that some bands get worse with age, No Doubt is one of them.
Ditch Gwen.
Gwen Stefani has a great voice, but it can get annoying at some points.
You'll thank me.
They need a new singer that won't hog all the fame.
"Tragic Kingdom" is an excellent album with great songs.
The albums after "Tragic Kingdom" gradually get worse.
If you buy this and like it I suggest that you get the debut album, "NO DOUBT.
I give "Tragic Kingdom" four stars because Gwen is so annoying.
"Return of Saturn" is a contender for this one, but "Rock Steady" just plain [stinks].
Don't buy "Rock Steady."

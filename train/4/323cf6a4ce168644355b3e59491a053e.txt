Mmmmmm.
Special edition?
I wondered what was so special.
Evidently it was only the box.
Hmmmm.
Inside was the same assortment of cookies I would expect in any Barnum's Animals box.
animal crackers.
These will be a nice treat for my little boy.Gary Peterson
Taste the same too.
These "Limited Edition" boxes constituted only about 10% of the total boxes.
Barnum's, it's even the same brand.
I found these at my nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market and the box was labeled "Limited Edition."
It was predominantly blue and featured a mother polar bear and cub, the same illustration as appears in the upper right-hand corner of the drawing on this box.
Ah well.
I remember liking them as a kid.

"Do not drop this item on the floor" the ear pieces break off and can not be re attached.
Also note that the ear pieces that actually fit on your ears are very delicate.
I can listen to my music without interupting others and I can tune others out as well.I only have a few complaints.
They seem to be hanging by a fine piece of plastic.
"sigh"
Don't be surprised if you can not receive some stations indoors.
I think it is a great gadget.
I own one of these little guys.
The head gear is adjustable for length, but not width.
I wear it in the office.
This radio is not that powerfull.
After wearing the head piece for a few hours it feels a bit tight on the ears.
The sound is quite good considering how small the device is.
However, this can not be adjusted.
It's fabulous!

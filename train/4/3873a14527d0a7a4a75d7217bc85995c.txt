The book that I am reading is called On My Honor by Marion Dane Bauer.
I am going to tell you one very good thing that happened in this story.
You need to read the book to find out what happens in the rest of the story.
Joel is not really into all of that so he tried to talk him out of doing it.
Joel really didn't like that idea.
This book is a really great book and I encourage you to read it.
They are very good freinds.
This book is a very great book.
But Tony ends of Getting lost in the river.
Tony is very adventures while Joel he just like to chill.
He really tried to talk him out of that.
In kind of like the beggining of the book Tony gets the idea to climb the bluffs which are mountains.
I gave it a 4 star rating.I think anyone who loves adventure should read this book.
But on the way to the bluffs Tony say a Vermillion which is a river.
A very nasty river.
The main caracters are Tony Zabrinsky and Joel.
He got a new idea to swim in it.

When you play it is really dark.
(humans and predators) The game is more alien than Predator.
The Predator is really hard for me.
So put on different visions to get a better look around.
This game is really fun and is filled with challenges and areas.
I killed about 5 people before I died.
Sounds easy.
Its hard in a lot of ways.
But fans of Predator will find the game good for the fact you could be it.
You can be walking around and an alien pops in front of you.
The alien is kinda stupid because he goes so fast you would run strait past the enimes.
I suggest you play the mini games at first to get the hang of the controles.
In 5 mins your out of amo with 20 aliens dead and about 60 more ready to kill.
Your in an area with 2000 bullets.
I tried to get some cheats but tthey were fake.
Then begin to fight for your life.

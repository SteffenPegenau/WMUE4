I love this product.
Additionally you have to condition...condition....condition.
I couldn't get more than 4-5 inches before it would break.
But relaxers were only part of the problem.
!
I did some reasearch and discovered that my hair was lacking protein.
I finally got fed up with chemicals and went natural.
That might not be much to some ladies, but its a good deal to someone who has never had long hair.
After trying this reconstructor, I discovered the strength in my hair.
Treat hair gently and don't skip getting a trim for dead ends.
One year after I started, I had hair 10 inches long.
I'm at 12 inches and going for 24.
My hair was weak, breaking off, and baby fine.
I use it 1-2 times a month (as needed), followed by a deep moisturing conditioner.
I can do it!!

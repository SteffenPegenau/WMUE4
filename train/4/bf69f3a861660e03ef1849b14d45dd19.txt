It is way too hot.
The booklet appears to be a nice addition.
This is not the case on the hut release.
I am very lucky to possess the original hut release of this on vinyl as well.
Most of the song is on the verge of clip.
In conclusion, I was worried that this release might negatively affect the value of my original lp, but I am not pretty convinced it has done just the opposite.
Zero is a perfect example.
It's beautifully packaged.
I didn't notice any other blaring defects.
I actually pulled it out and compared.
I bought this because i wanted one a copy i could just spin after ive had a beer or two and not fret too much.
That's unfortunately why this 5 star album only got 4 stars.
I've listened to it once already.
I enjoyed the soundstage of most songs and overall sounded quite good.
It's good to get this on vinyl stateside.
It often reminded me of how talented and overlooked jimmy is.

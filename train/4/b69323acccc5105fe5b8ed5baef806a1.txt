My favorite scene is the one where she fights with her mother.
That scene is hilarious!
That was just boring.
This movie came as a total surprise to me.
It shocks me how beautiful she was at that age.
My biggest complaint is the editing.
...unique?
She looked amazing!
This movie is all over the place and it probably would be better if it chose one path to follow but it still works.
She can do it all.
There's a lot of footage that should have been cut out like the family film scene.
I've seen every Streisand movie and this one is the one that stands out the most.
Not because it's the best but it's the most...strange?
Barbra fits the role perfectly.
She does such a broad range of acting in this movie.
A tiny bit of action, some comedy, drama, romance.

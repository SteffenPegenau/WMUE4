For new listeners, get Infest first, and if you like that, get this.
This CD is for Roach fans.
Which was exactly what I expected.
However, this CD is still worth owning, and defenitely pretty cool.
The songs sound about the same, but a little more melodic.
It's not perfect, but its worth owning.Closing comments:Youve got to love the cover.
Infest was a wonderful CD.
The video for "She Loves Me Not" is pretty cool.
Even though this is nothing really new, Coby (Jacoby now) still sings more melodically than the 20,000 other metal singers, and the lyrics are pretty good.
I didn't expect it to be.
This CD isn't as good as Infest.
The truth is, this CD is just a slightly less cool version of Infest.
Nothing beats "Snakes" or "Between Angels and Insects," not to mention the rest of the songs.
I loved it, and I still do.
There are some great songs like "Life is a Bullet" and "Born with Nothing, Die with Everything."

For rated game under 1500, it makes unrealistic mistakes,not behave like a human player.
I would recommend buying both ofthem if you really want to improve.
You are not going to improve by playing withCMX.
Unmatched learning tools, Chess Academy and others.
The problem withneeding a CD to run is solved with a new patch CMX 10.03from the Chessmater website.
This is a very good learning tool.
For playing chess, getFritz.
So, buy CMX for learning or training young kids.If you are above 1500 or even 1300, need a chess partner,get Fritz 9.
Make no mistake, CMX will beat you even you are a master,but the problem is non-human behaviors in low rating games.
There is no match in playing ability.Conclusions:If you are below 1500, you will learn a lot from CMX's ChessAcademy.
But its engine is notas good as Fritz 9.
It runs fine WITHOUT CDdisk in the CD drive NOW.
Thisalone worths the price for the software.2.
All other good things mentionedby other reviews are true.
For me, I will add:1.

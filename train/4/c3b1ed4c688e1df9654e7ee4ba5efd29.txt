Hi, would have given Hunter 4.5 stars.
Can't seem to do it however.
Thats all I have time for.
I love Hunter.
It is the only other Xbox game that I own, the other being Rally Sport.
I play Xbox about once a week.
Hunter is good for that.
I like a fun, challenging game that I can play for awhile then put aside until next time.
I recommend it.
I'm not done yet but, close.
I played with all the characters to start off and ended up with Avenger as my first character to use to get through the game.
I thought it might just be an OK game based on some opinions I read but, it certainly comes down to choice.
It will last me a long time and I look forward to playing it after a week.
The other reviews here cover the game well enough so I just want to say a little about why it's a great game for me.
I bought Hunter based on reviews at various game sites.

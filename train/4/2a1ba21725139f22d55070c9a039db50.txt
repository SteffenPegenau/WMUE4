Anyways this album is encredibly listener friendly.
Well Done!
You all know that music is a form of expression.
Why can't you people get that!
I will not compare him to James Blunt because that would already be judging him.
Which is no good because we have to look at what artists are trying to convey in their music.
And you won't find yourself skipping through any tracks at all.
Totally no harm in doing that and it sounds good after a bad day for those of you under a lot of stress.
This music can break stress right out of you.
I tried, but I couldn't resist hearing every track first.
To think that a lot of people told me he sounds gay is utterly atrocious.
So they're expressing themselves.
I must admit this album is something for everyone despite it's short play of just only 10 tracks.
I mean he just sounds like that when he sings.
A good debut!

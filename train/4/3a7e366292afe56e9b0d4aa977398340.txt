His voice and music?
Five Stars.
The documentary, film-wise, was fine ... typical documentary.
Was it the "too much, too soon" syndrome?
The man was a cad.
If so, then the man led a pretty pathetic life.
It really left a bad taste in my mouth.
I'd have to give him one star.
Was it the drugs?
Was it all the adulation and fawning from his female following?
I can't believe some of the women he used kept coming back for more.
But the man the documentary is about is another story.
The man?
If you enjoy and admire Chet's music and voice but don't know much about the man, do yourself a favor and skip this documentary.
It took some time aftering viewing the documentary before I could listen to his music again.
I gave the film four stars because, again, film-wise not a bad documentary (especially if it really captured the true Chet Baker.)

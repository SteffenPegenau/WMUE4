The heaviest album that I have heard in recent memory would be anything by Pantera.
Metallica3.
Motley Crue10.
Megadeth4.
"Mouth for War" is one of the heaviest songs recorded.Iron Maiden is a great metal band- but not the best of all-time.Iron Maiden's album, No Prayer for the Dying, is one of their worst albums.Here's my top ten metal bands:1.
Judas Priest5.
Guns N' Roses9.
Anthrax7.
Black Sabbath2.
!
I was listening to one of their records and it seems tame compared to albums released by Judas Priest, Pantera, Megadeth, Metallica and Guns N' Roses.
AC/DCPlease feel free to change the order- but these are the ten best metal bands of all-time.Sorry, Iron Maiden just ain't one of them!
Pantera6.
Skid Row8.
Iron Maiden is not one of the best bands of all-time.

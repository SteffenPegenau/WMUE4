If you have all the other series, naturally you have to have series 5!
I am just thankful that Jennifer Saunders keeps AB FAB going.
As always, the bloopers are hillarious.
Nothing makes me laugh as hard.
The woman is just brilliant.
The things that come out of that mind!
I hope there are many more series to come.
I was disappointed that "Wheels On Fire" was instrumental in series 5.
It almost works just as well as an antidepressant!
Series 5 was better than series 4.
I could be in the worst mood, down and out, depressed; I pop in AB FAB and it instantly cheers me up.
It's a great song and could have been done in a Junior Vasquez version by Bette Midler or Joan Jett.
Her mannerisms, her facial expressions, her impatience with people.
I'm sure that most of us AB FAB fans agree that series 1,2 and 3 are the absolute best.
Jennifer Saunder's Edina just blows me away.

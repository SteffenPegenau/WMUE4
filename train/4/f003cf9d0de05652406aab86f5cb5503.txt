I am the fan of the ''PALEOWORLD''.
I was like WTF?
Publish those series on DVD or blue-ray!
I love ''Paleoworld'' and I hate this little of the dvd collection.
Guess what?
HELLOO!
Shame on you all!
Can't they publish those series on dvd?
BUT we don't use VHS's anymore.
They did not bother to update the DVD collection and add the rest of the missing episodes.
PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE!Update:I bought this NOT EVEN of the collection, on August 31, 2008.
Now it is February 2011.
You can find all the most fascinating episodes with velociraptors and ortodones only on the VHS.
MORE THAN HALF OF THE COLLECTION IS MISSING!!!
I bought the collection of dvd's just for some episodes about raptors.

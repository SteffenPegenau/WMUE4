Circle - 4/57.
I was a little leary with this album at first but I like Slipknot so I figured that I would give it a try b/c it was only $10.
Three Nil - 4/5 First strong track.4.
Vermillion - 3/59.
2 - 4/512.
It is still good.1.
The Blister Exists -3.
This is still METAL, just not AS hard as they used to be.
Prelude - 2/52.
Vermillion pt.
Before I Forget - 3/511.
Pulse of the Maggots - 4/510.
Danger Keep Away - 3/5
The Virus of Life - 3/514.
Opium of the People - 3/56.
Do not judge this album based on the first single alone, the rest of the album is so much better than Duality.
Duality 3/55.
The Nameless - 4/513.
Welcome - 2/58.
I really like it because they are actually expanding.

The light scribe technology is also not free.
No labels, using sharpies etc.
All that being said, the short falls of the drive are not the actual drive's fault, it will just take some time for the media to drop in price, and it will.
Easy to install, great software bundle to boot.
As of now (3-23-05) the dual layer DVD's are about 3-4 bucks a piece.
They are convenient, but as of right now, you pay for that.
I simply love the drive.
You can't beat this drive, just don't get too excited about the technology it uses at this time, you pay for convenience.
The speed of the drive is fantastic.
The technology is cool, it takes about 20 minutes and you have a really cool (greyscale) label imprinted on the cd.
Light scribe cd-r's, which you must use to get the light scribe to write a label, adds about .40 cents per cd-r.
Does not sound like a lot, but buy a 100 cd-r's and this adds up!!!
Especially for the money.
Now, a little skinny on the media.
16X for a DVD is really flying as of now.

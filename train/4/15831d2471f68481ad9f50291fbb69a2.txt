These guys are amazing musicians first and foremost - and this album proves they can play just about anything and pull it off.
And convincingly at that.
They are still Phish after all.Though of course, Phish is broken up now, and they mean it.
Don't get me wrong - this still has elements from the Phish pond.
Yet it still works.
Ever.
Though, if you're looking for a regular Phish jam album, this ain't it.
I don't see that happening to this one.
Again.For a discography as staggering in size as Phish's, it's easy for an album to get lost in the shuffle.
No really, after this tour, they are not touring.
This album is very poppy for Phish.
And this is their last album - and they mean it.
The quirky lyrics are there, and there are some drawn out instrumentals.
Several of the songs on this album are even air-ready for the radio, should Phish decide to take that route.
Highly recommended.

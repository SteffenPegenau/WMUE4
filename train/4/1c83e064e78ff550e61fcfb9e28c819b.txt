They are both right and both wrong.
It's not different as far as general plot (Rambo escapes from jail after being harassed by the sheriff).
When they told me the book was different, they weren't lying.
But this is a nice alternate Rambo story.BY THE WAY!!!!!!!
I'm glad the movie ended up the way it did.
Do not read the introduction of the novel.
Somebody suggested this book to me and at first I wasn't interested.
But its different as far as events and character details.
A much needed "SPOILER ALERT!"
I was more than upset to find out that the ending is unveiled in the introduction.
I was a fan of the movie and didn't need to reread it.
If you love the movie, you must read this.
Teasle and Rambo are both flawed.
Wow.
should have been noted.
I love that there are no clear villains or heroes in this book.

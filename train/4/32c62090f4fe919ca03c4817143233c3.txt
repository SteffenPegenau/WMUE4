Well, I guess that depends on how hot you like it.
Don't fill higher than it says.
It is located on the inside on the water uptake tube.
I want to drink it right away, not wait 5-10 mins.Ease of use; there is not an indicator/cup fill line on the outside.
I purchased mine for $70 at Tuesday Morning.
Came home and read reviews that weren't not favorable of this maker.
For me it's fine.
I think it works fine.Also, the clock directions are not on page 10 as stated, but rather on page 12.
Instructions are a bit lacking!
That's it.
Not hot enough?
I don't like super hot coffee.
Make sure lid is completely snapped down.
I almost took it back but decided to keep it.Some of the troubles people had were easy to either fix or be knowledgable about just by reading reviews.
Make sure carafe is properly inserted.

I read the premise and had to see how this was executed.It's filmed very amateur style, but not poorly.
The killing scenes aren't very well filmed, especially the 2nd.
It really comes off as if everyone is just being themselves, but not in a way that looks bad.
The fact that it's black and white I think adds to it.
It almost feels like a home movie instead of a real film.
Interesting film.
The fact that there are 2 actual handicapped people in the film is neat.
I think in this way, it makes the events that unfold have that much more of an impact on you.I only have 2 complaints: 1.
It moves a bit slow at parts.
All in all, it's an interesting concept and I feel it's worth checking out.
Oddly enough, I stumbled across this film at a local library!
There are some really nice looking shots, as well as some truly creepy ones.
2.
Make sure to check out the interviews as well, very good stuff.
The acting is well...hard to say.

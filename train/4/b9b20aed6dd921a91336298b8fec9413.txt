Shiki is the best horror anime I've seen up to now.
They really capture the creepiness of each investigation pretty well.
The team investigates all sorts of different phenomenon, and each story is pretty interesting and surprising.The animation and voice acting in this anime are very good.
Everything about it blows other horror animes out of the water.
It's a whole lot of fun.
I'm a fan of horror flicks, but there are not too many horror anime titles out there.
I can't say anything bad about this title.
Naru is the leader of this team.
This one is one of the better ones.
I'm only gonna give it 4 stars b/c there are a few horror animes out there that are better.
He's kind of a self deluded jerk, but he's the best supernatural investigator around.
It centers around Mai.
Mai is a high school girl that joins a supernatural research team.
This anime is really entertaining.
Even so Ghost Hunt is really good and definitely worth watching.

Somewhere in my garage is an original pressing of "G.I."
.
That was over 20 years ago!
and this is a big "but" .
.
.
I see young punks in the street, dressed in black with chains, spikey hair and Clash/Germs/Sex Pistols/X t-shirts, and I want to walk up to them, wearing my suit and tie, and say, "I saw those bands.
But .
Time to let it all go.
Make your own history, stop wearing it."
I loved the time, I loved the music, I think he had tremendous potential, but it should be like a high school yearbook, something buried in a box you which crosses your mind in passing maybe once a year.
.
I was listening to Rodney Bingenheimer's show the night Darby gave out a satellite number so you could call long distance for free, and yes, it worked.
had Darby lived he would be 45 years old now!
I spoke to them.

How realistic is the story???
Women who have known each other for many, many years and who obligate themselves to regularly attend scheduled meetings of the Women's Institute, despite boredom and disinterest of many of them with the meetings' agendas.
The women still attend, and maintain their contact with each other .
The friendship of the women is laudable, and that kind of thinking and action is missing from so much of life here in the US.
.
.
for what?
.
for friendship!
A pleasant movie depicting small town life in England, and perhaps in other places as well.
I hope that places like this do exist.

The nude calendar, where the women are not really shown nude, is a pleasant diversion for them, compensating them for years of listening to experts on broccoli and the vagaries of toast, etc.

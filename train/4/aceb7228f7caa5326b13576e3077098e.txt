Long gone have the days wherein Rod screamed about Hot legs or Tora!
The fact that he has not contributed any song to this album says something about the man.
Out with the Boys.
Ballad after ballad brings tears to my eyes; Tears of joy!
Tora!
Sam and Otis have finally found the singer that -like the three tenors- will be remembered for their terrific singing!
Rod just can't resist it.
He has found out that he is not a songwriter, just the singer.
and that suits him just fine.
This album definitly proves him right.
Nowadays he has settled down (new wife and probably new kids underway?)
No less and no more but at the same time Rod proves why he his right not songwriting: His voice-impact is stronger than ever!!
Since he's into power ballads, Rock has left him for good.
He has discovered that not all artists have to be like Mick and Keith -who will probably die Rockin'- and the style he has committed to is just right.
Tora!
Hats off mr. Stewart!

Later in the book, she finds out more unbelievable things about John Walker.I like to read mystery books.
A ghost came to Allie for help.
While she is interviewing her, the papers on the table catch on fire.
It is called The Ghost of Fossil Glen.
One thing I liked about this book is the clues were the most interesting.
While Allie was looking for things in the library, things started to melt.
He was killed in a fire.
John Walker (the ghost) told her that Mrs. Hobbs killed him.
If you like mystery book, you would like to read this one.There is another book like this one.
She goes and interviews Mrs. Hobbs, the lunch lady.
He wanted revenge.
She goes looking for more information about what happened to him.
I think they are the most interesting things to read.
He goes to Allie and tells her things.
He wanted to get back at the person who killed him.

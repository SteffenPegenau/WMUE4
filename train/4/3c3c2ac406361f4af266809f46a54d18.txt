Try it out!
I saw this one Friday night and soon after bought the dvd.
Just go along for the ride and enjoy the sights and sound.
I have only viewed the sub-titled version, and it works great.
Techno and pulsing, watch this on a home theatre or with a high quality audio system.
In my opinion this is a real good way to spend an hour and a half.
Filmed in Germany(West Berlin) maybe, and lots of outdoor city locations.
Plus I enjoyed the little "snapshot" stills that Twyker throws in along the way.
A couple dialogue- heavy scenes which require some reading, but not too taxing.
It really adds to the experience imho.
Also a fine soundtrack in this film!
Thanks for reading my sort of disjointed review.
Very cool.Some negative reviewers say they didn't get the film and it was repetitive.
The other reviews give you a plot breakdown, but I will mention a few things I really like.
I do have a thing for most things German, so I like hearing the language.

Probably one of the best mixes, considering the vintage equipment used.
Fast songs, slow songs.
I was expecting this to suck considering everything they've done had been a step-down from the album before.
But in the final process, the album sounds really together.
Bad bass sound.
The vocals are a little less abrasive.
Go buy it.
Cool guitar work.
Most the tracks are have an upbeat feel.
The lyrics are still well-crafted political hymns (much unlike Against Me or Anti-Flag who have very simple cliche lyrics).
But the album is still energetic.
This album actually has fast songs again.
Thin guitar sound is pretty thin and low in the mix.
But I think it was actually a nice step-up from Exit English (which was a total disappointments after Change Is A Sound).
Decent drum sound.
And where as til this day, I still can't tell the difference between songs on Exit English, Dead FM has a lot of dynamics to it.
Its a good album.

"The Day I Tried To Live" is a very interesting song.
It is a prime example of the genre at its best.
It is an excellent song which shows how beautiful Chris Cornell's voice can be (it also has a very original video).
It is dark and moody, but has some upbeat stuff too.
"Fell on Black Days" is my favorite on this one.
The lyrics make it seem like someone is given a chance to live and they waste it.
"Spoonman" is the other radio hit and is different than most of their songs.
It has a great beat and some very cool drumming.
This is another screamer and features more of the signature tightness from the band.
Any fan of the grunge era owes it to themselves to get this.
There are many other good songs on this album, but I feel these are the biggest standouts.
"Black Hole Sun" is the mega-hit from this album.
Everything about it is excellent.
It has the perfect balance that is so hard to find in many songs.
This is Soundgarden's most famous album and deservedly so.

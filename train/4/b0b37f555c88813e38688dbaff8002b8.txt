Or is it a deep-seated spiritual thing that compells us to treat others kindly that makes us human?
It's a lovely comedy about perceptions.
But they've somehow become taken with humankind.
I liked the reverse effect.
It might have been because several reviews I read were negative.
Until they live among them for a while.
In the beginning of this film the aliens believe themselves to be superior to lowly humans.
Is it because we were born on earth?
They've come to TAKE.
The supporting cast was excellent as well.
Eddie Murphy is very talented.
I don't know why I missed this movie when it debuted.
Gabrielle Union, splendid!
I don't know why.
What makes us human?
As for the actors: Everyone gave good performances.

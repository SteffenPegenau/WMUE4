As if the Cranberries just had to get a cd out quickly and slapped it together.
I liked this cd more and more over time, but there's definitely a "rushed" feel to some of it.
"When You're Gone", "Electric Blue" and "Joe" are sweet ballads.
"Hollywood" rocks even harder than "Zombie".
Do we really need a song in this world called "I Just Shot John Lennon"?
The production on songs such as "War Child" and "Bosnia" are simply over the top.
I'm sure Dolores' heart was in the right place, but this is simply un-appealing!
Simply program out the three (bad)songs, then you'll remain faithful to the Crans!
That being said, that's my only criticism of this album.
For their third album, the Cranberries dropped producer Stephen Street for some guy who produced Bon Jovi.
Not a good move.
They should've been buried.
"I'm Still Remembering" is a call for affection.
"Salvation" and "Forever Yellow Skies", it's kick butt time!
Ten great/good songs can make me forgive and forget the three bad ones.

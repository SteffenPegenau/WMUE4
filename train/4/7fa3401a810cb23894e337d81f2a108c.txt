2.
Only minor gripes can be found, and are nothing enough to ruin the movie.
3.
Incredible special effects.
Good acting on the part of Hamilton.
Some problems: 1.
None of the characters were particularly interesting this time around...even Sarah Connor lacked any interesting qualities.3.
4.
They should have switched Robert Patrick (T1000) with Arnold.
The big-budget, grandiose feel of the movie lacks the raw terror of the first film.
The original film was much scarier.2.
Arnie would have been FAR better as the evil, liquid-metal droid.Some good points: 1.
Great story that moves along a bit slower than the first movie, but remains high-quality and a cut above most sci-fi.Great movie!
The actor portraying the T1000 looked about as threatening as a puppy dog.
Widescreen version is far more satisfying.

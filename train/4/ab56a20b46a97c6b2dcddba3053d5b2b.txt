But that's the sign of good book.
Really interesting!
It has many interesting facts with lots of New Testament translation errors, ambiguities and factual information.
Isn't it?
I'm actually starting to read the book a second time and I'm discovering some things I missed the first time.
Good stuff!
Concise.
Full of introductory and advanced information.
The only complaint I have is that I wanted more.
Informative.
I highly recommend this book.
This is an easy to read book.
I also liked the chapter, "How The Universe Really Works".
This may sound boring, but Cayce presents the information in an easy to read and intelligent manner.
Intriguing.
The chapter on "Dinner With the Christian Fundamentalists" was also informative and even funny.
It even has a chapter on Aramaic and Greek translation errors.

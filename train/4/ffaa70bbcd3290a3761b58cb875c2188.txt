The movie's just like the novel.
And it's cheap.
It is right if someone said that you can't compare a book and a film.
What do you expect?
They stand in diffrent medium.
I just dont like this ending.
But the screenwrite made an alternative ending that made the story had a happy ending.
And some jokes were included.
So, you wont find any detail emotion of each characters and it had no time to built a mystery as thrilling as the book.
I read the novel and it was brilliant.
The screenwriter could write all the important parts of the novel into a 1,5 hour film.
The novel already had the better ending.
It was OK.
It's like you compare a fried chicken and an orange juice.
But,you know,old movies usually had short duration.
There's no need to make a twist by changing it.The DVD is okay.
What about the movie?

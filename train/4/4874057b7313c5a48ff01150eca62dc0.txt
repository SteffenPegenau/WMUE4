After reading some of the reviews, I think the lack of bass, or mids, and highs could be an equalizer issue.
And if they do break, good luck on finding replacement parts.
So far they have held-up well.Pros:Highs and lows are there.
I agree with other reviewers.
I think as far as long distances are concerned, any brand of head phone will be a nuisence.
Noise reducer (notice that I didn't say eliminator)does more than an adaquate job.
Handle them gently, no snowboarding with your mp3 player!
I've had my for 7 months now.
Volume control is nice.
No breakage.
Head-set fits nicely on my head.
And they should hold up well.
Treat any electronic with kindness...
Let's face it.
But, that's my opinion.Cons:They are a tad bit flimsy.
Nevertheless, I purchased my h-phones on ebay for a mere $1.25 so, I am more than satified with this product.

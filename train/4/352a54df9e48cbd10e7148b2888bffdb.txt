I've read all the reviews on this machine, good and bad.
And it was.
I just received it today.
And for the price It's a steal.
I just purchased this for my 6yr old daughter for Xmas.
It's a sharp looking machine.
I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't played a cd in it yet.
Just some simple fun at a fair price.
And I'm very happy I did.
I'm very happy.
I know my daughter will love it.The volume on the microphone sounds great, loud and clear.
I did my research for 2 wks on any and all Karaoke machines.
Now I'm not looking to have Karaoke night's every Friday, so I wasn't interested in anything to fancy or expensive.
And with anything, I took a chance.
And if that's what you want, this is it.
Easy to use and operate and carry for a 6yr old.
I opened it up to make sure it worked and was in good condition.

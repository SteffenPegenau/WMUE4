Teenagers use these by the ton- that's why they all have such sparkly smiles.
Hint- get down around the edges where your teeth meet up- just push the strip in with your fingernail.
But it is a little pricey.
Just be sure to cover all the areas of your teeth or you'll have stripes!
You pull out the strip, peel off the flimsy part and apply it to your front teeth.
Oh come one, everyone uses these now, don't they?
It can't hurt you.
Lots of dentists throw in free teeth whitening when you first go to them.
And using strips does require some dexterity.
You can really do this all day if you want- I'm not the manufacturer so I can say that.
your teeth are lighter.
White strips are flimsy little pieces of film coated in some form of peroxide bleach (I assume) that is tooth safe.
In about five minutes, you peel it off and voila!
You can't eat or drink while they are in- so bonus!- you might lose an ounce.
Well, you should.

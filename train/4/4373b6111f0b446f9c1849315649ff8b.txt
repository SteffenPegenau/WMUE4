You were the golden girl, but that was the past.
So do the colors in your eyes.
You decide to place your own face over that of the Queen because you are, of course, royalty.
Listen with caution and with an open mind.
Your sister turned out so much better.The first song on "Rock Collection" is called "Spokes".
She thinks the world of her little girl, and spoils you with all the crayons you want, and larger-than-life dreams, and a puppy.Years go by and the colors in the coloring book fade.
Just ask your mother.
This is an odd coloring book.
It tears you right down the middle of that emotional divide between expectation and disappointment.
Sometimes we need the darkness to see the light because we are all flawed, yet beautiful.
And your natural hair color.
And your aspirations.
Addiction is no prettier in real life than it is in the movies.
It is not for the faint of heart.
Nor is the rest of the album.
There are outlines of playing cards inside.

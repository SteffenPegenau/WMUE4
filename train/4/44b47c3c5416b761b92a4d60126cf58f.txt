.the Tallis Scholars sing well but not as flawlessly as the Cambridge Singers.
Most buyers recommended this recording over the others.
(Still that is the only reason for giving four stars instead of five.)
I heard it live by an excellent college choir in my hometown and immediately set out to find the best recording of it.
I am fond of sacred choral music and purchased the CD mostly to obtain the recording of Gregorio Allegri's "Miserere Mei."
In Media Vita is another gorgeous song (first on second CD).
Additionally the other songs are also so relaxing, flowing, and meditative.
This song alone is worth buying the set.
This set of CDs is truly wonderful.
(By the way "Miserere Mei: by Gregorio is hard to find.)
I will be honest .
.
If you haven't heard it, I'm sure you'll love the flowing melody!
The sound is still lovely and the songs gorgeous.
You will note that not every consanant is hit in unison, but this is not overly disturbing.

Only a little dissapointed.
The WRITING is still great.
I believe that most of these critiques are too harsh, and I want to adderess that.
Some of the people complaining about the book seemed to confuse the two.
It is the story, and I'm not offended in any way.
But the writing is still superb, as are the insights and the way they are expressed.
I like The Laws Of Our Fathers.
I do understand that it is a story told from one point of view, but I was in Vietnam, and I did sympathyze with those who objected to the war.
The story itself I had a problem with.
Please keep it up.
Emphasis on writer.
I think that Scott Turow is a great writer.
The only view presented was one sided, and that is Ok.
I loved Presumed Innnocent.
It may be the style that people object to.
I was there for my own personal reasons.
I do agree with the person who said that he was confused about the genre.

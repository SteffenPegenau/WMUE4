On the other hand, it may not be fair to compare these very capable Cuban trumpet players.
Album is more "rootsy" than the first.

Jesus, on the other hand, offers a relatively similar musical offering.
When you compare Jesus' group to Sandoval's incredible horn section re-dubs .
Compare Cubanismo with Arturo Sandoval's Hot House album.
Here's hoping he continues to develop this format.
Actually, Jesus' albums are more focused so far (and in the same general groove) than Arturo's.
Both very good.
Out of 6 or more albums, I have found each of Arturo's albums to be so different as to render me confussed as to what he really wants in the way of an audience.
This recording is similar to seeing the group live.
you will be amazed by the difference.
So far I like his stuff.
Hot House has got to be one of the all time great big band latin jazz albums.
I like it, just had to listen a little more than the first album to get it's "it".

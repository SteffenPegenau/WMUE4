You can't fault the DVD in any way.
Okay, now that I have that out of my system...This is an excellent collection.
Why start with 3?)
I hope they're released soon.
Sometimes it seems like they try too hard, but other times, you see the early humor of the series come into play.
They got me into the series and made me love the characters.
(I mean, wth?
I have no problems with the way the DVD was put together.Now for the content.
This portion ties up a lot of loose ends and questions that fans had, but it also creates new ones.
It's edgy and fun.
Where are the first two?
They did a good job.
This portion of the storyline is very cohesive.
First, I need to get this out of the way: I loved seasons 1 & 2.
That's good, though.Overall, it's not truly great, as I feel seasons 1 and 2 were, but season 3 stands on its own if you know the characters already.

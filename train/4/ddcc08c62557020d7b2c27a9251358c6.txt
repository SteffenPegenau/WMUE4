Yep.
Suits me just fine.I get great reception.
I swear!
But it's true.
My little snoogy phone.
With all of these owners and their new-fangled cell phones with their bells and whistles on them, many people are pretty surprised to see me pull out this antique (in terms of cell phone technology anyway).
I love you snoogy phone.
Yes I do.
Can you believe that?
Just a Plain-Jane ol' cell phone.
A great basic service plan.
No picture capabilities.
I love you...
Yes...my itty-bitty, little snoogy phone.
Most people can't.
I've dropped it about half-a-dozen times, too, but it just keeps on working.
And I still have the original battery in this sucker!
No special screen.
Amazing little guys.

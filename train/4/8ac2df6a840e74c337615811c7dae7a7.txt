Other than that, I give it 4 stars!!
In other words, I'll investigate every nook and cranny of the game to find all of the jewels, or secrets.
Any game that makes you want to continue playing until your done is worth the money.I do have one problem though.
Well, when I went back to those places.
I have just finished this game recently.
Problem was in the level called "Inside Information" I made the mistake of finding a Spear, Ruby, Shield, Necklace.
I was hooked!!!
Guess what, they were gone and they didn't show in my inventory that I received them!!!
This is a flaw in the game not in the player.
So, I was unable to fulfill those missions.
I spent 7 hours finising from where I was.
I'm an adventurer.
It's a shame too, no I'll never know what I would've received as a reward!!
Then when I completed that level, and onto the next level, I was asked by some of the dwarves to retrieve these items.
!
There is nothing you can do.

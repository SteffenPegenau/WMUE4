My all time favorite book was Icefire, by Chris D'Lacey.
You will have to rread the book to find out what happens next.
This book, however, was an all time favorite.
Once he does this, Liz's "Aunt" shows up.
She makes clay dragons and sells them in a market.
As she begins to settle in, she turns the house upsde down.
His landlady, Elizabeth Pennykettle, is a potter.
Also, there is another book in the series, Fire Star.
This book is second, of three, of a science fiction series.
I have alot of favorite books.
These books are best suitable for any age group.
This book was, to me, a very good book.
David, curious of this, wishes to see the Icefire.
Mrs. Pennykettle made a special dragon, for David, named Gadzooks.
This book is about a tenant, David Rain, and his landlady's family.
Lucy, Liz's daughter, made David a wishing dragon.
David is in his second year of college and one of his teachers is having an essay contest.
I think this because it is very addicting to keep reading it.

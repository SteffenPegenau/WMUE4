She not either of these and detracted for me.
Perhaps Robbin Hood character is best description.
Premise is interesting but not all that much to ponder or debate like some SYFY does, or can do.
Partly my problem on how to describe main male character is that the "villians" are not very strong characters.
Wishes she had been more attractive.
Robin Hood?
Saw trailer for this in movie theater before it played in theaters and did look interesting but never got to big screen to see it.
So, in the end, a decent action film and recommended as that, action.
Terrible thing to say, but in that middle ground between "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" and Charlize Theron.
I dislike them for different reasons but I do not hate them and thus importance of main character is diminished.
Hero?
Heroine??
And, "interesting" it was.
Not sure what to call main character.
Premise is interesting and well thought out as it pertains to movie, characters and action.

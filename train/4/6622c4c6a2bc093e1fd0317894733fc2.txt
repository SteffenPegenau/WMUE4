I saw this and thought it would be good because the child sits in the front.
I had to drill a hole in the tube frame of the bike in order to secure the seat to the bar that was included.
I wanted a child seat to ride my 19 month old son with.
Also, you can't beat the price.
I took my son on a ride with that one and he didn't like it nor did I. I like this one because it mounts in the front of the bike.
After that it mounted very tight and secure.
My son loves the seat and I do too.
It's easier to turn and balance with the weeride.
I bought a beach cruiser with 7 speeds.
It just takes a little mechanical experience to mount it correctly.
My sister had a bike seat mounted in the back.
The mounting of the seat took about a week because I could only work on it during the weekends.
I would recommend it to anyone.
I received it about 3 weeks ago.
The balance and turning of this bike seat vs. the back mounted seat was everything the website said.

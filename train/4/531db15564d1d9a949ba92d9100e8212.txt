my friend can't stand the beginning and i couldn't either when i first got the cd.All in all, this is a really good cd.
Having a Blast.
In the End.
this is a very good but strange song about a suicide bomber.2.Longview.
one of the most original* songs on the cd.3.Sassafrass Roots.
i mostly listen to this and blink 182 (the good old cds) if you like greenday, also check out sum 41, white stripes, weezer, and the strokes.
F.O.D.
Coming Clean.
i really liked this cd, but some of the songs do get repetitive ( not that i mind, i'm the only person i no who can listen to the old ending theme for Inu-Yasha 20 times and not complain ) and some of my favorite songs on this track are:1.
it just is.6.
Really good beat and lyrics.5.
I no everyone hates this song.
really good song.
I don't no why this is my favorite song.
that's why i love it.4.

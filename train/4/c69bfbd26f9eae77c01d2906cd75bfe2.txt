I will readily admit that but damn, sometimes stupid is so enjoyable.
Funny thing is, he saw the role as a pox on his career.
Buy and enjoy!
Just a lot of un-PC fun for all!
I can't believe it's FINALLY available on DVD.
Her "babeosity" is drool inducing.
And the soundtrack...so damn good.
His performance makes the whole film and God bless him for it.
Ron Leibman's performance is one of the best comedic villians of all time.
I never thought I'd see the day.

And Stacey Nelkin is none too shabby either as the inevitable teen "love interest".
This movie is amazingly stupid.
Think again, Ron.
Okay.

Enjoy.
You can see it in this movie.
Acting just plain "Weird".
Grandma's tired now.
Brando is at his best in Missouri Breaks.
The movie is so-so.
Bye.
He goes from accent to accent without any direction.
Nicolson is admirable playing the straight man against the whacked out Brando character who is kind of a cowboy homosexual killer type.
Brando had a reputation for being strange and acting on a whole different level.
It's one of the roles that gave him his reputation for being an eccentric.
The Brando performance is just something to watch and marvel at.
He did the same thing in "One Eyed Jacks" which you should definetely get if you liked "The Missouri Breaks".
He was on the edge, doing his own thing.
It's really worth a look.
He is so fun in this movie.

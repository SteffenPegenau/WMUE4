He's 56, overweight, and still living the American dream.
He splits his time between the old home town in Pennsylvania and his condo in Florida.
As flawed and human as ever Harry is still struggling to balance his conflicting impulses.
He's swiftly wearing out.
Another decade on and Harry `Rabbit' Angstrom is well into his middle-age.
He's the product of an excessive USA, and consumes with gusto.
Finally he decides that maybe enough is enough.
And Rabbit is tired.
And his health is suffering badly from his indulgences.
I, for one, shall miss you.
He can't even resist his own uncertain daughter-in-law; with predictable consequences.
But Harry is incapable of moderating his behaviour.
His opinions are still modelled by the media and corporate American mores.
All should be well, but his cokehead son is running the family business into the ground and Harry is eating himself to death.
So long, Rabbit.
Selfishness and lechery are still getting the better of him.

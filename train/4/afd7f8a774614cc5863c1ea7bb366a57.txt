Did one exercise, and change is already happening.
Joe did it and so can I.
I'm going to buy some extra copies and pass around.
This is a simple process that Joe teaches.
I bought both this book and Spiritual Marketing at the same time not knowing it was an earlier version of this book.
But hey, you have the book and it is worth every penny.
Now I keep it with me to just open a page, read one or two paragraphs to have a thought for the day to reflect upon.
The only thing Joe could have done better in this book, is repeat the five steps again and again and again.
You can change your life.
Notice I did not say easy.
I love this book.
But I have read them both and love them.
I read it through once.
You can become a magnet to success and prosperity.
But the rewards of doing them are great.

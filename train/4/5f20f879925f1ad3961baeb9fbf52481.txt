As Radiohead's return to recording after almost 2 years, Hail To The Thief (HTTT) is an amazing work.

Wow, Guitars - rockin' ones.
Quickly becoming one of my favorite songs.The only thing that really irks me about this album is The Gloaming.
But other than that, this is a solid album and I reccomend buying it.So do it.Right now.No, now.C'mon!
Beautiful.
Hand claps.There There.
Something lacking in the past two albums.We Suck Young Blood.
Perfection.A Wolf At The Door.
That song, for some reason, cannot click with me.
After first hearing almost three months ago, when an unmastered copy leaked to the internet, I must say I was blown away.
Looming.
Great solo.I Will.
A few reasons why:2+2=5.
Haunting.

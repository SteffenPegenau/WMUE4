The relationship between Max and the chief worked.
It had it all: comedy, romance, political satire, physical comedy and action.
Carrel made the role his own and was very good.
Arkin's role as the chief was good.
The homage to the car and the shoe phone of the original show was good.In summary, the movie was good.
The movie captured the broad strokes, but missed the subtle humor.
The physical comedy was good.
The cone of silence and the other gadgets were excellent.
My wife and I laughed a lot, which is the major test of a movie like this.
Some of the scenes fell flat.
The humor was both broad and subtle.
I'm a big fan of the original series.
Hathaway as 99 worked pretty well.
The romance worked.
It missed some of the political satire and subtle humor of the original show, but for a movie made from a TV series it was very good.

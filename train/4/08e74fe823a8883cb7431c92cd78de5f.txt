it's no 9 Long Years, but it's good.
The Real Pills.
and looking at it that way, it's a good album.
we all know that.
this is a great, play it loud in the car CD.
they do it sloppy.
There are some greats out there.
judge it on it's own.
Oblivians, yes, yes, we know.
This album is a rarity now - no one is putting out good garage.
the thing about covers, is you gotta let the new take it where they want to go with it.
it's all glam and 80s revival.
ah, man, it doesn't do any good to hold on to your expectations of a cover.
The Makers in their earlier days.
let it go.
that's my taste though.
I wish the ettes would put in a bit more soul - I can feel that it's there, but they're not bringing it.
so many people do garage wrong.
this is a great album.
it has great energy.

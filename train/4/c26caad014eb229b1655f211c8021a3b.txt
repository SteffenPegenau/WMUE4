I love the weatherband features, particularly the standby alert for severe weather.Overall it has proven to be a solid radio that serves it's purpose very well.
Four cheap D batteries have easily lasted two three-day trips.When at home we use this as a kitchen radio.
Also the battery life might be the best I've seen in a portable radio.
I bought this radio to use primarily on weekend camping trips.
I would strongly recommend this product if you are looking for good sound quality in a small, well built package.
Overall it is great little radio.
It is good, just not great.
input have proven to be very useful in this role.
The only beef I have is that the AM reception is not as good as other Sangean products I have used.
The FM reception is above average and very clear.
It only gets distorted with the volume near max.
It's small footprint and aux.
The materials are of high quality.
The sound quality for a 3 inch speaker is top-notch.
The features are easy to figure out even without instructions.

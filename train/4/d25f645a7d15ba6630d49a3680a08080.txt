This is long before he had achieved national recognition.
But, The Last Nail and Old Tennessee are superior.
Comes and Goes is a wonderful, relaxing song and is one of my all-time favorite songs from him.
The title track and Crow are okay songs.
Next Time and Man In The Mirror/ Below The Surface are better.
The only thing wrong with this CD is that it is too short!!!
Perhaps, it's because my young, wife hails from TN and these songs both make me think of her everytime I listen to them.
Don't expect a set of country, or just love songs, or ballads.
!
This is one of my favorites from him.
The disk opens with Aspen/These Days.
This is yet another CD that I previously owned on vinyl when it first came out.
This is one of Dan's best!!
Perhaps, this CD shows off the versatility of Dan.
He uses strings on this song and it has a classical/rock feel to it.

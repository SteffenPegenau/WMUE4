It worked great!Sorry, but I thought at first I was reviewing the pool instead of the cover.
I bought a cheap pool cover, but it was impossible for one person to put it on.
I bought this pool to entertain a six and eight year old.
I then bought the one made by Intex.
I love this pool and highly recommend it for this age child.
It comes about to the thighs of the six year old and knees of the eight year old.
The ring needs aIring up about every other day, but it is easy to do.
I wish I had put level sand under it though.
It is 12' across, so it was great for adult floating as well.
But it was perfect for the age grandchildren I have.
It really did the trick.
It was fairly easy to set up.
I just hated to waste the info.
They aren't afraid of the water, so they could swim with minimum supervision but not alone.
I understand all the water will spill out if it deflates.

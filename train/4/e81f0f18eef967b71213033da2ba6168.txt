Most of the game is very realistic untill you get to the later levels.
Dragons, Zombies, Magic?
)and the music is cool.
You can go on killing rampages w/ the awesome bullet time(Max Paine,Dead to Rights).
It's like Kung-fu fighting mixed w/ max paine, GTA and need for speed all in one!
If you like the mindless GTA style bloodbath then theres some of that too!
I guess i've talked enough so i'd just like to say 1 more thing... Buy this game!
The graphics are average(cmon,2d trees!?
The missions are fun and theres almost endless gameplay.
Tons of fun!
You can roam around the city of LA while jacking citizens cars and speeding around corners causing chaos.
This game is awesome!
All of this of course will give u a bad cop rating.
You can complete the set missions or bust street crimes.
But you can do good deeds(busting criminals w/ out killing them and not killing civilians)to earn a good cop rating.
Last time i checked this wasn't a fantasy game.

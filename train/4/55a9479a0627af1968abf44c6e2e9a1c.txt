Basic Plot: Vampires.
It just wasn't quite what I'm used to.
Try it out.
I mean I loved the Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld, but I just wasn't so sure about this one.
I enjoyed it way more than I ever thought (4/5 Stars).
Very interesting.
This is a very smart, interesting book.
I was very hesitant to read it.
It took vampires on in a whole new way.
All and all it was a really cool and fascinating take on Vampires.
Now there is a lot of talk about parasites--and those with squeamish stomach may not like it, but I'm pretty much a baby and it was fine for me--but all the parasite talk was my favorite part about this book.
I actually learned something.
Scott Westerfeld's take of them.My Thoughts...This book was a very pleasant surprise.
You might be pleasantly surprised too.
I couldn't have been more wrong.

It's water resisistant too!
It keeps the product secure during exercise.
They kept falling out when I jogged.
In fact, I sold my Creative Muvo TX series because I hated the buttons.
I bought a 512 mb memory card and the product had no trouble recognizing the expanded memory.
The buttons are durable and easy to use while exercising.
The drag and drop feature is so easy to use.
The earbud type did not fit in my small ears and were a bit uncomfortable for me.
I love this mp3 player!
They felt cheap.The Muvo Sport's backlight is helpful.
I've heard people complain of bugs in reading an external memory card.
The only reason I gave it four stars was I had to purchase different headphones.
I can read the display with ease.
So I bought some RCA clip-on ones and they work great!Also the armband is nice.
I'd highly recommend this product to someone who wants to use it for exercise.

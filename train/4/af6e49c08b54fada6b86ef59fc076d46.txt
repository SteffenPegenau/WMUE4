It's very easy to read!!
Not to mention you get extended drum solos, guitar solos, etc.
What makes concerts awesome is how they often include more guitar sounds or they may change the melodies slightly.
When listening to live shows on dvd/cd you'll never get the same quality you get when you listen to the studio tracks.
You can view the files in an easy reader software they include.
I was definitely not disappointed with this set!
Or I explored the dvd on my computer and copied them to my hard drive.
The dvds are definitely high quality in my opinion.
But it is close on these disks!
The original booklet is included on the dvd and all the files are in jpg format.
I was highly impressed!!
They include many different camera views so its very entertaining to watch.
You can then edit the files and you can easily read them if you zoom in.
!
So its worth it to buy these disks just for that very reason!

Very portable.
WOW!
Watch the expiration date on these tanks.
It could hurt you or kill you.Cute compressor and works as I hoped.
The instructions on this compressor said not to use beyond the date on tank for risk of explosion.
You really should wear ear protection and run it when it won't bother the neighbors.
With this guy, put on your ear plugs before you switch it on and don't forget your eye protection too!
My old compressor broke down after 35 years.
My old compressor gave off a "chug, chug, chug" sound while this gives off a loud hum.
But then, compressors are noisy machines.
Same with propane tanks.
I measured it with my Radio Shack sound meter and it read 90 decibels at 10 feet.
Good thing the pump broke before the tank exploded.
I ran it in my garage with all the doors closed and when I stepped outside, it was still sounded noisy to me.
My old compressor didn't have that warning nor a date.
It is painfully loud.
But I think it's noisy.

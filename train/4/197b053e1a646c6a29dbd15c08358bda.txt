But I do know when someone puts time into making a game.
And it takes about a million hits to beat some guys.
Its my favorite game after all the games I've played.
The realism could be better to make it tougher or harder, you get shot with arrows about 10 times before you die.
It would cut off about an hour in the mines of Moria.
It even made me want to read the book!
And I'm asking to much but I wish now that there was a direction arrow or something.
But seriously, this is a great game.
From beggining to end its great fun.
Its a must have for anyone who likes action/adventure.
And I wish that you could look at your goals after they show them so you dont forget them.
Tolkien would be proud.
Talk about perfect transfer from book to game.
Who doesnt?
Okay, let me start that I'm not a great gamer.
Fighting trolls as Aragon, slipping past Ringwraiths as Frodo and casting spells as Gandalf.

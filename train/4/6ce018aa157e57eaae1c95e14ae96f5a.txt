However, the last fifteen minutes of the movie are shot in virtual blackness.
All you can do is pretty much listen to what's happening in the film.
So what?
You might like it.
It was surprisingly funny at times, too.
Lloyd, the central figure of the film, was pretty hysterical.
However, if you're like me and you love alien-related junk, you'll probably dig this little movie.
In the process, Lloyd inadvertantly unleashes a seemingly omnipresent gaggle of shadowy, violent federal agents who chase them down at every turn.
All those expecting special effects and violence, however, beware!
The Plot: In an attempt to uncover a decades-old conspiracy involving alien-cover-up, old guy Lloyd enlists the help of some amateur documentary filmmakers.
Yeah, it's a rip-off of Blair Witch.
I still thought it was pretty fun and effective.
There is none.
Check it out if you like X-Files and Blair Witch or Paranormal Activity or The Fourth Kind.
As the tension builds, so does the fun.

If you did not like Chaos that much, give this one a chance- the songs are much more catchy and memorable than most of Chaos.
Yes.It seems most negative reviewers make the mistake of comparing this album to past works.
Will I play it again?
Word is Paul began this album after Driving Rain, but put it on hold to do Chaos.
I'm not going to over analyze.
This does seem like a successor to Driving Rain.
Yes.
Do not expect the successor to Chaos, and for Pete's sake, do not expect this to sound like Band on the run!As I said, a solid effort worth repeated plays that I'm glad I purchased.
Do I generally like the CD?
Are there at least a few songs I like?
This is not, and is not meant to be, the same.
Comparing this to Ram, or something 30+ years old is silly.
The one comparison I'll make is I do like this better than Chaos and Creation.
Yes.
So I'd say if you liked that CD a little, you'll find a few things on here you'll like.

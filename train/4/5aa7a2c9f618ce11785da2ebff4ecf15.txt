The functions are very nice.
The watch is a bit complicated to set at first.
I normally don't spend much on watches.
It is a bit quiet if you are a deep sleeper but works admirably.
The alarm on the watch only works in the master time zone not the alternate time zone.
I have always loved watches that provide utility.
You can set two times on the watch but this is only good if you are staying that time zone.
The watch does not need a battery.
It has the perpetual calendar which I find indispensable.
If you are a person who has had watches that don't have this feature you will love this.
The watch is very professional looking.
It is not good for quick reference.
This time I splurged and I am glad I did.
After initial setup it there is no maintenance except for DST or if you change the alternate time you set.
I think you will enjoy this watch.
A CD is provided that makes it very easy to follow.
The watch provides day of the week and calendar date.

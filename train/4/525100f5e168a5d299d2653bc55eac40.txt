What did I enjoy about this book?
Keep on writing, my brother.
Looks like you have a couple.
I commend you for your creativeness.
'It's okay to be a loving father and husband without the drama'.
The first thing is that I appreciated reading a book that spoke to some of my thoughts as it relates to fatherhood and relationships.
I probably start and don't finish another 4 or 5.
I completed reading your book over the holiday weekend.
There aren't many books that I've read that are written by African-American authors that don't just depict us as lazy, drunks, whores, or thugs.
We navigate through life with this hope.
Woven into core of this novel is the fact that that good overcomes evil.
I usually read non-fiction self-help books.
For reference, I read 7 or 8 books a year.
It was a hell of way to express your thoughts without having to preach.
I appreciate you poring out your thoughts on life through this tale.
They say we all have a book in us.

After five minutes of looking through the new book with me, she was inspired to pick up a large leaf and place it under her chin.
The really funny scene was when she tried to pretend a guitar case was a double bass.
It is entertaining.
However, I still like the book.
"I'm playing my viola," she said.
The pictures are really great for kids.
She took a stick and began rubbing it back and forth across the leaf.
The strong point is that it gives children a good introduction to the instruments.
The instrument examples sound electronic to me.
Incidents in each period seem to have been picked at random rather than for their overall importance to the period.
It isn't really a general overview.
The Witches Chorus is rather overpowering.
I think they could have chosen nicer music for their cd.
The charts of music history is confusing.
My two-year-old was there when I opened the package containing this book.

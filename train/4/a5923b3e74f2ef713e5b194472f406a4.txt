And a slightly different approach to a holiday movie.
It's on par (intensity wise) with a "Finding Nemo".
She asks for it almost every day.
This movie was very good.
I don't think it is.
Much more action filled than a typical Christmas movie.
My 2 1/2 year old girl loves "The Flight Before Christmas".
I won't get into story lines or plot elements.
Lots of fun & adventure.
Some reviewers are complaining this movie is too scary for little ones.
Good animation.
I simply say the movie is a lot of fun.
And something different than your typical "Santa and his flying reindeer" type of movie.
I'm not comparing the movie's quality to Nemo.
Our whole family enjoyed it.
I'm just saying if you found Nemo to be acceptable for your children, then you'd have no problem with this movie (imo).

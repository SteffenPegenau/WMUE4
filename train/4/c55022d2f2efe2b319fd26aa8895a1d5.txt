I had bought it used many moons ago when DVD players where still going for $150.
Of course it was either that or buying a DVD player for $125.
Then it hit me, my old Xbox works as a DVD player and surprisingly i still remembered you needed this.
It was almost 10 years old anyways.
Well my DVD/VCR combo gave up the ghost.
For fear off people not wanting to buy the Xbox because it lacked this feature they came up with this scheme.
Also my upstairs DVD player went dead on me about the same time.
At the time DVD players where still going for about $125 for a cheap one.
Microsoft was trying to recoup some money on offering DVD playback in its console.
As i dont watch many movies as well it will do a job.
The kit at the time was $30, so Microsoft made about a $23 profit on this.
Also i do have another Dvd player as well as my main unit.
Anyways thankfully you can get this now for under $10.
I dont really play video games now that im 37.
Their was a reason this remote was needed.

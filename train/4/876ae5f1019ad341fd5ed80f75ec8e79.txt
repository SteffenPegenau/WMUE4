Way, Way, too expensive.
It is just horrible that people buy out every toy that they think is going to be in big demand come Christmas and then try to sell it for 3 times as more money!
Never again.
Now I'm trying to get another one for my other son(because I know they're going to fight over it) and can't find it for under $110.
Now its in Wal-mart for $30!!!
I ended up getting it on e-bay for $150!!!!
Luckily I did get one and only paid about $30 for it.
If the price doesn't come down or Target doesn't get it back in stock, I will wait until after Christmas when it's everywhere for ALOT cheaper.
Only because I had a $25 gift certificate and I applied for the credit card to get an additional $30 off.
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF FOR RIPPING OFF CHILDREN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I had the same problem last Christmas trying to get the mickey mouse clubhouse.
I totally agree with the other reviewer!
At the time I bought mine, it was $80.
Thats just CRAZY!!!!!

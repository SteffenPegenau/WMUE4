Anyone who puts it down is a stereotyper or a to-be-critique.
Very small pixles make the images crystal clear, and the people look more, eh.. peopleish than in red and blue (where people looked like a two-ball snowman with eyes).
It looks so real!
It is a bummer that you can't trade with all of the other ones though.
Even though these games appear childish (like the other review said) they're really cool.
Instead of a mechanical bleeps for music, this stuff is real.
But still, its a great game.One problem, though, is that I miss team rocket!
Their whole evilness is gone from the game, and I miss it.This game has sweet graphics.
POKEMON RULES!
I got this game once and lost it.
They have a really uniqe style which I really like.
That shows how much I like it.This game is really cool, and it has graphics that blow away the other games.
(for a gameboy game, anyway).
Pokemon has and always will be my favorite type of game.
Now I'm buying it again.

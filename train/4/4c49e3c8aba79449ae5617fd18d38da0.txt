This game is incredibly immersive.
You forget everything else; hunger, tireness, how numb your arse is from sitting on it... everything.
And I found the background music nice, but incredibly grating and repetitive.
All you can think of is 'just one more mission!
I had to turn it off in the end and listen to a CD.But these things are easily ignored.
Just one!'
Morrowind is great fun to play, and has more than enough replay value to be worth the cash.
A little more colour would really improve things.
It was just the same theme playing over and over again!
I found much of the landscape drab and colourless - far too much brown, grey and khaki.
My only complaints are with the music and the grapics.
But I'm going to play parrot and say it again.
The music didn't even change with setting!
It was very gloomy.
A game has to be good to be that addictive, and this one certainly is.
Okay, so everyone's said it before.
And then it's 5am and you're wondering where the time went.

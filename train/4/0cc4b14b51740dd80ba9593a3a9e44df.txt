If you are looking for groundbreaking work, lighten up or buy another album.
But it's also a fun ride through Gotham with the top down.
Let me start by saying that I am an old school Bowie fan.
But they are only references.
As a frequent visitor and lover of NYC, I can hear the city woven throughout the songs.
Reality is the product of a skilled artist and entrepreneur knows how to craft quality music (and product).Why 4 stars?
How could one not notice these references!?!
Many reviewers have compared this album to various stages of DB's past.
That said, Reality, DB's latest release is a fun ride through post millenial NY.
My very first LP was Diamond Dogs.
This is not a genre defining milestone like Ziggy, Diamond Dogs, or Heroes.
This is, however, not a concept album.
This release is undeniably pop.
Reality is a collection of rock and roll pop songs, that do not pander to a particular genre or audience.
Reality is also not nearly as dark as Heathen another 'NY album'.

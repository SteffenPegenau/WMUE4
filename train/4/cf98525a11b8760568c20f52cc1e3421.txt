I don't know what effect he was trying to achieve, it was lost on me.
This, in my opinion, was the best film of the year.
We know these people.
But Crowe chose to do a series of cuts that were jumbled and out of sequence.
Crowe guides us through the plot with humor, sentiment, and nostalgia.
At any rate, it was a second-class ending to a first-rate movie.
Maybe someone else has an interpretation.
It really was a series of some bad choices.
Well, there's a sequence at the end that just annoyed me.
So why only 4 stars?
Upon finally getting his exclusive interview, William asks his first question... and the movie should have ended.
The last minute aside, this movie is a classic, one that I will watch many times for years to come.
The character development of this film is flawless.
Hell, I knew a lot of these people in high school.
The performances ARE perfect, and I was quite disappointed at it's lack of Oscar nominations.

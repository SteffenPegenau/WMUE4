He liked mouthing the somewhat soft corners and I played it for him.
The only problem is that there is no volume control.
It has withstood some hard knocks.
The corners are rounded and slightly rubbery.
The songs are nice too, jazzy and complex enough to be interesting.
That is pretty neat.
It has five or so songs and you can turn off and on each instrument.
It seems really tough.
It's kind of heavy so just now has baby really been able to haul it around.
Got this as a gift when baby was 5 months.
He now plays it himself (13 months).
It has a very solid feel, which worried me at first because I was afraid baby would hurt himself face-planting into it, but no injuries.
Baby likes it.
I do not think he gets he can turn off and on each instrument but I suppose that will come.
The quality of music is very good, not mechanically computerized like some toys.
Batteries last a pretty long time in it.

"Time to go home" is wonderful.
Like I said, Reading the book helps.
Reading the book puts everything in perspective.
Yet, I know I like it.
"Calaloo" makes you want to move.
When you look at the origin of the CD (creating a musical) it becomes more clear.
!
The theme remains the same.... Have some fun, have a drink, have some more fun!!
I love it, my wife loves it, and my 2 daughters love it.
All in all, I feel this is in keeping with Buffett's other works.
However, without having read the book (after the purchase of the CD, for me) it makes much less sense.
My personal favorite is "Kinja Rules".
I think the characters from the book were well represented and I enjoyed "getting to know them".
Some of the lyrics threw me (Like in "Fat Person Man" what is "I will keep him on the beach at the barbaque"?).
I don't know if it is the beat, the running diolog or the humor of the situation and how it is presented.
Face it, the CD is enjoyable.

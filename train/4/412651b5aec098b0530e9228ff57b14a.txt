But the green was not the light sage color I expected... more of a dark olive.)
The others seem right on point however.This is the softest, warmest, lightest, fluffiest blanket ever!
I read all the great reviews and bought 3 of these blankets!
(But like I said the color was off anyway.
I bought it for a gift for a friend having a baby.
I have one wrapped around me now while I type my review.
But the specs do say that it is 50x70...I am only 5ft so I thought it would cover me head to toe, but it did not.
So much in fact that I wound up opening the one I had planned on using for a gift.
The color is quite off.
Turn off the lights and it will really be a show!Next purchase, a humidifier...
Also the green throw does not look like it appears on the web.
So 50x60 sounds more accurate.
They are really warm.
I really do like them.
I was a bit disappointed by this.
One caveat, the air must be dry in our house because these blankets give off static cling sparks!

I am sure that they were not thinking that they were going to make a smash hit album.
No.
However, these gentlemen are keeping the tadition going.
At first listen I did not hear anything special, but as I listened more, I began to notice my feet starting to pat, and my head starting to move along with the music.
Great singing.
These guys can sang.
Then I notice that this is really some great singing.
There will never be a group like the orignal lineup of David, Eddie, Paul, Melvin and Otis.
I believe that they wanted to do a Tempts interpretation of these classics.
Still Tempting to me.
Are these the original 5 Temptations?
That is because there has not been nor is there anyone that sings there style of music like the Tempations.
Great songs.
And finally, this is really a good CD.
One thing is still true.

Especially "Circles Round the Moon".
Proabably the same writers.
But it is an album I still listen to.
I was amazed that Dave from the Eurythmics worked on this album, as did the man who engineered a lot of the Eurythmics' albums.
One of the prettiest love songs I've heard in a long while.
It took awhile for the album to wear on me.
I loved this era of Geri when she got fit and into athletics and rock.
Sometimes after a long day I'll play it and it always gets to me.
For some reason the song and video for Scream IYWGF always reminds me of that Garbage song "Special."
Overall a good album although I didn't purchase it for the #1 remake of Its raining Men.
But it is my fave.
It is more of a playful pretty love song.
I always liked the New Radicals and I like his rock contribution to the album.
"Don't Call Me Baby" reminds me of the song "Stop" by the Spice Girls.
After purchasing Schizophonic on Amazon I decided to give Scream a try.

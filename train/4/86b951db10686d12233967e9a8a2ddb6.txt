Listen to it again and again.
I suggest you download their first single and listen to it once a day for a week.
If you know them from Celebrity Skin and like those top 40 countdown, you'll hate it.
If you know hole from Live Thru this theres a 50/50 chance you'll like it/hate it.
I started listening to Garbage Man, god is it catchy.
One way to start liking the album isby playing it on guitar coz those are fast entertaining songs to play.
Good Luck.
I dunno...
Garbage man or Teenage Whore.
Wether you like this album or not is the way you know hole.
If youre addicted, buy the album.
If you hate them, repeat.
You have to remember rock is not easy listening, the album is incredibly catchy if you listen to it again and again.
You'll either love it or hate it.
When i heard it for the first time, i swore i said: "Im gonna stay away from this cd".

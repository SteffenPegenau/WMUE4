Directed by Robert Hamer.
Soft, enjoyable fun.
And (I'm sorry) it may even make you think (or maybe give you a few pointers on Lifemanship)!
Yes, a happy ending!
No punching and violence like the Three Stooges.
I've loved it every time.
I've seen this movie so many times... from the time I was a child and didn't understand it all until now and understand it all too well...
Just humor.
No Obscenities.
No embarrass your fellow human sight jokes.
No Chases.
A story about an underdog who wins by winning.
No -- no laugh 'til you cry.
No Belittling.
With (a very young and handsome) Ian Carmichael, (a terribly nasty - and funny) Terry-Thomas, and (a manic) Alastair Sim.

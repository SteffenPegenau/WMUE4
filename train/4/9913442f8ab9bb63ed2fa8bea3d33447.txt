Plus, you can't go wrong with Toshiro Mifune.
The music is quite good, as well.So, I would recommend this film, but only to the right viewer.
And justly so.
It's complicated and it's deeply rooted in Japanese culture.
Now that I have, I am not disappointed.
The tale of the loyal 47 retainers is a classic.However, the film moves very slowly.
Years ago, I'd heard references to its tale and always wanted to see it.
First off, I really enjoyed this film.
The first hour alone (the film's approx 3.5 hrs long) is just to set up the actual problem.
This is a story that takes time to tell.
Visually, the film is lovely to look at.
Even when the 47 go into action, the fights are over quickly.The cast is strong.
If you're a fan of Japanese cinema, you'll appreciate some of the recognizable names and faces.
The viewer needs time to comprehend the situation.
If you're looking for an action film, look elsewhere.

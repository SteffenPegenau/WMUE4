After Bons' passing I lost track of the group.
The roadies carried him through the audience, all the while playing Bad Boy Boogie Solo.
I watched Angus RUN all over the stage back and forth all through the show.
When they aquired Brian, I paid no attention,thinking its not the same.
I started collecting Concerts of AC/DC I found "No Bull", purchased it.
I happened to see it on amazon, and picked it up again.
I had seen AC/DC way back in 1978 in Denver, at Red rocks with Blue Oyster Cult.
That was when I found out AC/DC ROCKS.
One of their better shows I think.
Then I heard "Hard as a Rock."
WOW, at that time I did not really know who AC/DC was.
WOW, again I started paying more attention.
The DVD was destroyed by carelessness on my part.
THIS time I'll take better care of it.
Again WOW.
HOLY CRAP, Bon Scott was unbelieveable.

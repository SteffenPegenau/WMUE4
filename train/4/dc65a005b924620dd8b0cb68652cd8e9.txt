the song was "run into flowers".
the first time i heard m83, was on james lavelle's global underground barcelona.
i never really paid much attention to it.
(dp)
it sends shivers up my spine everytime i hear it.
amazed......"before the dawn....", though not as good as "dead cities...", picks up where the last one left off.
let me just say it's pop music for the year 3000.my favorite song is "teen angst".
i'm not gonna try to give a detailed explanation of what m83 sounds like, because it will take too long.
it's a win-win situation.this message is not endorsed by the bush administration, halliburton or its affiliates.
i just thought it was a decent song.then, about a year later, i see "dead cities, red seas, and lost ghosts" at ear-xtacy in louisville.
"before the dawn....." 4 starsbuy either one, or buy both.
i was blown away.
absolutely immaculate.
"dead cities...." 4and1/2 stars.
that is a beautiful song.
i bought it, not really knowing what to expect.

Absolutely ridiculous for a state of the art, next generation DVD player.
THERE IS NO SLOW MOTION PLAYBACK!
So yeah, if you ever want to watch an action scene in slow motion , forget it.
The person I spoke to put me on hold multiple times, and was completely stumped.
At all!
Component is fine.
No mention of slow playback in their anywhere), and then said I should keep on pressing the fast forward button.
I told her I tried that, and it doesn't work.
For $200, it can't be beat.
No slo-mo.
Quality of picture, is great, even though its not HDMI.
OK, heres the dumbest aspect I cannot believe.
Not mentioned at all in instruction manual, tried every combo of buttons and finally called Xbox 360 support.
Too stupid.
This HD-DVD player is a great value.
Asked me if read the instructions ( of course i did.
You can freeze frame, fast forward, etc.

A bit too long.
If someone asked me if it was an good read?
Almost perfect.
Loved her will to accept nothing but the best from society, from herself, from her husband.
Good backstory, mystery.
Julia though is AMAZING!!
My keeper shelf?
Warm love scenes, not just sex, although the author makes you wait a while for it.
Too many suspects kept me guessing, good mystery.
yes.
Could not pin down Who-Dunnit until the author showed her hand.
For the price it was certainly worth it.
No.
Would I run out and shout to the rooftops that everyone should read this book?
EHHH?
Not enough insecurity, longing in Morgan's introspection.

I will say that at times it was not well exlained so I was set to guessing.
Good luck
Still struggle with the transitioning of material but not beacuse of this book.
That was pretty much right on.
I'm 54 years old and wanted to learn to play guitar.
I use this book now to go back and review as well as a reference source.
I've been playing now for nine months and continue to practice 5 to 8 hours a week.
I also thought it would take me two years of regular practice to play songs with confidence.
Worth the investment!
Amazing how the material the second time around is easier!
I figured it would take me six months at 5 hours a week.
I purchased this book in March of 2011 and worked pretty hard.
By using this book, it has made it easier to translate right handed material.
There was no magic here but couldn't have done it without this book.
Not a lot for lefties.
Other material helped in some clarification.
That appears to be the case as well.

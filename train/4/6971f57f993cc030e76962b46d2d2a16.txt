I don't really understand that.
I gave Frindle 4 out of 5 stars rating.
All in all, Frindle is an overall good book.
The teachers at Nick's school said that anyone who said the word Frindle has to stay after school and write this sentence one hundred times: Iam writting this punishment with a pen.
Its pretty cool how Nick makes up a word and its heard all around the world.
The word Frindle was also put in the new dictionary.
It's funny how Nick's mom and Nick's principal argue.
I like how Nick is smart and he is a trouble maker.
I wish I was Nick because he became rich because the word Frindle was on merchandise.
Nick must have felt great knowing that his word was in the dictionary.
That made everyone want to use the word even more.
I recommend that you read this book.
I thought Frindle was a good book.
I read Frindle by Andrew Clements.
Its awesome how Nick was on t.v.

This is a rather dumb story.
This is fun to watch, though.
It is.
This one, though, at least has some laughs.
However, much of Ellison is dumb stories to make points, and that is what this is.
He doesn't much like people.
It's not a great film but it's certainly not as bad as the other reviewer said it was.
If you really want dark, see if they ever make a film out of the final installment of the story of Blood.
Don Johnson is far from my favorite actor, but he actually is competent in this role.
However, we are dealing with Harlan Ellison here and with Ellison, nothing is ever as it seems.
Most of his stories are somewhat bleak.
Talk about bleak and terrifying!!!!
Ellison is dark.
Even on the printed page, it's a rather dumb story.
I hate to disagree with the other reviewer.
He does make some good points.

She got better within days of the chant.
Just be very careful.
To this day, I still have remnants of those abilities.
I know that sounds crazy but it's true.
So be careful what u are wanting.
I bought this book years ago and was very surprised by the results.
The only downfall is the pronunciation's arent very good.
Some chants are hard to say.
The chants DO work.
I dont have the book anymore cause I loaned it to a friend and never got it back but I would love to buy it again.
But be very careful.
I had visions of things before they happened.
It was an amazing book.
But I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to get into the arts and make some of their dreams come true.
I gained psychic powers.
I did a chant to heal my sick dog and it worked.
I also tried a chant to make myself gain special abilities and it also worked for a time.

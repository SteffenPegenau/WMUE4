More of an obligation of love just from being related.
And Paige is similar to the Phoebe in previous seasons.
Piper has definitely taken on a fierce roll after Prue's death.
After the loss of their sister Prue, half-sister Paige comes into play.
The sisters no longer have that bond that was shown through seasons 1-3.
This season is packed with action, drama and a lot of fun.
I was a huge fan of Prue, so this change was a bit difficult.
I'm new to Charmed, and have yet to watch the remaining seasons.
But this season still managed to have me hooked.
There also seems to be a bit of a role switch.
She takes a bit of getting used to, but she shows her worth and true character within a about 5 episodes.
But from what I have seen, it's a completely different show.
I wasn't quite sure if I'd continue to watch Charmed/buy the seasons.
Definitely recommended.
Just watch out for a different show than the first three seasons.
Watching Paige's power grow was great.

For best sound, adjust the sound levels on the iPod and the speakers.
--I am happy with these speakers.-- And if they don't last forever, that's okay because they are so cheap.
These speakers seem to be sold under many names, so SHOP BY PRICE.
These speakers runs on 4AAA batteries or a USB2 jack for your computer-included.
And if you crank it up, it sounds distorted.
This device uses batteries quickly.
If these speakers look the same in the picture, they are the same.
Heavy bass will distort the sound-sorry no lush bass.
Also, the first unit I bought arrived broken because of cheap construction.
Input is thru an earphone jack, so you can plug in any ipod or audio device that has an earphone jack(portable radio/cd player/mp3 player etc.
Mistake!
It was replaced by the seller (not this one) without a problem.
Again, shop by price.
It began to melt.)
(I bought a 6volt adapter for mine and tried it with the batteries in.
)The sound is good for the price.

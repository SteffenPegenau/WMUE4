She was an old dog from Indiana.
Will they get $500 dollars to pay off the taxes and not lose there home?
It is a great book and is a nice thing to read.
Willy's grandpa also had to pay lots of taxes.
He wanted to try to help his grandpa because he was sick.
So go to your local library and check it out!
So Willy and his dog Searchlight were going to try to go in a dog sledding contest and win $500 dollars.
Willy entered by using all his college money.
My favorite character was the dog named Searchlight.
This book was called Stone Fox and it was by John Reynolds Gardiner.
!
I recommend this book to everyone.
Willy was a boy who was ten years old.
I also liked the character named Willy.
Will Willy and Searchlight win?

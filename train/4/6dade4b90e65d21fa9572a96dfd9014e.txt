Fast delivery!
Each set lasts me for about 2000 hours, so if you do not use them continuously like I do they may last quite a while.UPDATE 2/16/2013.
It is very unusual for a company to change a design and use the same model number but in this case I am sure glad they did!
They are excellent quality for speaking sound range.
2/13/2013 I use these headphones to listen to audiobooks.
Same quality of sound.
I use them continuously for 10 or more hours per day as while I work around the house.
I buy 2 at a time so I have a back up when one ear goes dead .
This is the 3rd time I have returned to this great value.
For $6 I do not mind replacing them as needed.
Fussing with wires will work to return sound but once they go out they stay unreliable.
Since this design will have less tangling issues I expect the lifespan will be longer.
They have changed this product.
It has a Better design.
There is now only a single wire coming from one ear rather than having wires to both ears.

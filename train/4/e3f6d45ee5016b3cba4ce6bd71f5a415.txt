Place the two units 3-5 feet apart.
After contacting Eddie at Impact Merchandising (the distributor of SkyScan products) he emailed me with a fix.
Leave them out for AT LEAST 15 minutes.
I received a similar (but not identical) SkyScan clock from Sams Club about 1.5 years ago.
What you have to do is take out the batteries from both the clock and the temp sensor.
If that doesn't fix the clock you can purchase a new temp sensor for $5 directly from them.

You should get a signal within 15 minutes.
Then place new batteries in the clock.
If not repeat the process once.
I replaced the batteries and that didn't seem to help.
Their contact info is :Equity Time6262 Patterson Pass Rd.
The outside temperature sensor stopped working.
It's worked great up until last week.
(DO NOT TRY TO SET THE TIME OR PRESS ANY BUTTONS ON THE CLOCK).
Then make sure you place new fresh batteries in the temp unit first.

He's one of the all time greats.
Our Program Director was standing out back with Earl by his tour bus.
He asked me to hand him his guitar when he came in and went on stage.
Don't know if it was a medical problem, or just overuse over the years.
A little personal story...I work in radio.
I'll never criticize Earl Thomas Conley.
Don't be too hard on ETC for his mildly disappointing vocals on this otherwise energetic live set.
And I'm thrilled I finally found a live CD, after all these years.
I'm listening to this CD right now, and it's good.
Fond memory.
I put the strap over his head when he came in.
And, of course, it IS live, afterall.
In 1984, ETC came to a big nightclub in Corpus Christi Texas where I was working at the time.
I recall hearing something years ago about him suffering from vocal problems.
I went out there and met him.
Thanks Amazon.

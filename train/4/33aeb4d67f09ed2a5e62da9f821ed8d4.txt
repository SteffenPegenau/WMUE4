So i bought two for $52.
They look and sound good.
I had to re-order once i rec'd my first unit.
first-i am disapointed w/amazon for not specifying " sold each " be careful.
( Good bassey speakers are 45-60K.)
office their fine.
Appear well made.
The spec sheet is also confusing.
As it turns out their 75k.
Who buys 1 speaker ?
audio system, in a bedrm or sm.
I like the compactness.
One says 55k-20Kanother part states 75k-20K.
If you want these for a sm.
If you pair these up w/ larger say 6-8" 3 way units as i have, then they compliment ea.other fine.
Maddening !
Shame on amazon for the deception !!
A good buy overall.
Still not bad.

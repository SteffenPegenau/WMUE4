You and your child will feel great!
(Ages 5 and 7 now, started at age 4.)
It is a miracle teaching your child to read!
My children go to a fine public school.
This easy to follow step by step program is great.
However, it has worked for 2 of my kids.
As you go through, you have to trust your instinct every now and then.
Don't be overwhelmed.
Anyone could do this.
And BOTH of you will be readers!I am not a home schooler.
But by the end, WOW!!!
It all flows quickly and makes sense.
I just wanted to do a bit more.
My only drawback is I think there could be more focus on phonics, but there is a strong emphasis.
The 20 minute lessons give the kids such a feeling of self-satisfaction.
There is a lot of reading at the beginning, before you get started.

The 1st single, however, I Knew I Loved You is horrible.
The upbeat songs are full of joy and excitement.
.
Overall it's a very enjoyable CD with some soothing rhythms.
They write their own songs and have created their own style.
Just another example of a cheesy pop ballad.
They are a duo, with one singer and one musician.
Affirmation and The Animal Song are also good songs.
It was overplayed to the max on every mainstream radio station, and it wasn't a great song to begin with.
Chained To You is probably one of the best on the CD.
Savage Garden is certainly an interesting group.
Therefore, I don't think they should really be classified as a boy band.
But in closing: What exactly is the savage part in their name supposed to mean?
It has heartfelt lyrics, and was the perfect choice for the 2nd single.
Crash And Burn is a beautiful slow/midtempo song.
.
There really isn't anything 'Savage' in this CD .

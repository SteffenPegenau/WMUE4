I think "Follow the Leader" is.
this one though, seems a little spaced out.
Of course Freak on a Leash and Got the LIfe are the best songs.
but it could have been better.
but songs like Pretty, and Justin, and Cameltosis, are just [strange] songs.
despite fred durst being a moron, All in the Family is a riot in my opinion as well is the Earache my Eye hidden track.
I dont think so.
.
there something evident on each album that reflects the band.
but its not as in depth as the others.
Its definitely a good album.
everyone says that "Life is Peachy" or "Issues" is the downfall of Korn.
I love BBK as well.
Its still a good album.
they aren't really needed.

It seems kind of easy and long.
This video also has a section on upper body which is really good- you can skip the lower body if you want.
My favorite tape is Cardio Sculpt.
The music does suck and the set is strange.
It moves so fast it is hard to protect your knees.
Also the hard plastic step is a pain in the but to move around on the carpeting.
Body Sculpt is extremely hard!
I have started doing The Firm body sculpting system again after a 2 year break and I can definately see results after the first 10 workouts.
I find the instructor (on all of the videos) is moving on to the next move and I am still taking apart or re-assembling my fanny lifter or switching weights.
Looks weird!
I remembered why I quit the Firm before- this video is killer on the knees.
I don't recommend to anyone with bad knees.
I don't really like the ab sculpt.
Why are the girls kneeling on and lying on the wood floor-kind of stupid-bad for back and knees.
I find it easy to follow and quite a good workout.

You must eat something when you take it.
It is not a weight loss pill, it is just to help boost your metabolism.
It is a multi-vitamin.
Also many people say they have experienced nausea.
Again, this isn't some miracle weight loss pill!!!
It says that it is supposed to help give you energy, but it does not give me energy at all.
I decided to buy it to give it a try.
I have read many reviews on this product about nausea and how terrible this product is.
I have taken it on an empty stomach before though and I felt no nausea at all!
I started excercising and taking this and I guess that combination of the two helped.
I feel that it has helped me a little.
Don't expect to shed 20 pounds.
It just helps with your matabolism.
I would definitely suggest giving it a try though.
It all depends on the person, but it does not hurt to try.
What doesn't work for some might work for others!

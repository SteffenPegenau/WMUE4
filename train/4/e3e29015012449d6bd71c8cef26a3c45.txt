I orderd both on line.
I knew I had dislocated my shoulder because I felt it go.
I reset my shoulder and apparently my arm at the same time.
The thumb loop is really set up for a right arm injury and it was awkward on the left.
But it was a life saver to have the sling!
I didn't realize I also broke my arm.
I sat there wondering what to do.
Even leaning to get up hurt.
The only problem with it was that it really isn't ambidextrous.
This sling was great.
Not only did it help immobilize my arm, it made it obvious to people not to jostle me.
Amazingly, I went back to sleep that night.
At 3 am one morning, I tripped over my computer bag in the dark and fell.
The next day I realized I needed a bra with a front closure and a sling to keep my arm immobilized.
I wasn't dressed and couldn't move my arm.

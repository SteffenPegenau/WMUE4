No referees in the ring3.
Not enough illegal moves (only headbutts)2.
Some of the knockdowns are silly looking4.
This game tops every game made for PS2 so far.
Also, THERE WAS NO CREATE BOXER MODE!
This game has everything you need to be satisfied with boxing.
Finally something great came out.
You couldn't even throw body punches.
Here's just a few cons i found in the game.1.
No grapplingThat's all i found so far, otherwise it's a great game and i recommend it to everyone.
I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because i'm kind of picky with games.
The graphics were poor, and the gameplay was slow.
Feel safe to buy it.
So i went backwards to knockout kings 2001, but i didn't like that game either.
I bought knockout kings 2002 and I hated it.
The graphics are top notch and the gameplay is realistic.

The installation was smooth.
The product is brilliant.
Due to their no response, I ended up buying an unnecessary thing.
I have not heard any, even confirmation, for a week.
The scanner function is also poorly covered.
Again the product is great and I will recommend to anyone.
Brother does not seem to have any intention to help their customers.
But if you need help.
There was no answer for two days.
The software suite is not explained anywhere.
However, the instruction manual covers primarily fax functions only.
There is effectively no part for the printer.
So I sent another to their support.
You have to take care of yourself.
I sent an e-mail to Brother asking a couple of questions.

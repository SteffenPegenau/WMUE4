You need to go over the surface multiple times.
So far, I feel it was a worthwhile investment.
That being said, subsequent uses are far less painful.
Well...
I did end up liking it once I got through my first session with it.
All in all, the epilator is a good product, once you get the hang of using it.
Also, this skin irritation isn't so bad as long as you keep up with the exfoliating.
I've only been using it for a month or so.
I expected miracles from the product, which I guess is unreasonable.
I would like to say I have retired my razor all together, but I still use it probably once a week or so for a clean up.
I cannot stress this enough.
I will give some advice though.
The first use hurts INCREDIBLY!!!
I was prepared from the reviews of others that the Epilator does not remove every hair the way shaving does.
You do need to allow extra time, but I feel you gain that time back with less shaving in the shower.

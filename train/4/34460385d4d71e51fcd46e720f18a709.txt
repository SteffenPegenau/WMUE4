I found by the time the lid can be opened the waffles are very well done.
Glad I bought it!
It took forever to make waffles.
Just brush with oil or butter and it's good to go.
Now the time is cut in half.
The user manual says that the waffles are finished when the handle can be easily lifted.
Nonstick works great.
Too done.
Easy cleanup.
I lived with a two slice waffle maker for years.
Maybe more experience would help.
No seams to worry about either.
I might be doing something wrong.
Just poor in the middle and put the lid down.
They are edible but a bit brown.

So far, I have not been disappointed that much.
!
It is not perfect, but I am enjoying the improvements, and the quick response when you press the button is just worth it all!!
My dad has the next level up, so I knew what I was getting.
The close-up photos of hail stones were great!
!, though.
Realistic color is improved and I am enjoying this part.
The close-up of falling hail didn't stay clear as I zoomed in.
I have had it over a month and have taken many different kinds of photos.
I had a canon A540 before this and wanted to upgrade to get closer photos and clearer pictures.
A little bit bigger than my old one, but the fun I am having overules!
Very close up of singular flowers came out fantastic.
Did video of a major thunderstorm that brought a tornado to my neighbors.
It is very similar to his.
Caught some quick action shots clearly...was great.
Scenery pictures come out great.
Overall, I am enjoying the camera.

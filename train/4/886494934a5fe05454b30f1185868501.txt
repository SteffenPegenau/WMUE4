Really rough being told to get back to the fight.
Emptiness!
Lives of soldiers in war and what dealt with.
What they went through to get ready for their assignment .
Introduce to Fleming 's top squad .
What happens when the mission goes array.
Open up with the bit of battle .
Fighting close to vest rough pushy.
Losing friends trying to get back to base.
It kind of uncanny the start .
Wives and family dealing with lost.
Doing all they can with what the got win or lose.
Scenic background awesome.
Truly gripping .
Lot of quick thinking, action, losing those men and no one knowing except their family.
Lost of good men that would not be rewarded for their valor and loyalty.
His best man put in charge .

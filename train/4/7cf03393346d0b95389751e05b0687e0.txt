I reluctantly returned the unit back to the store.Now I got a Nomad 3.
When I play music with my Bose speakers, it was a bummer.
I think I will stay with it.
Sound quality with a headphone was OK although not great.
I initially bought an Archos Jukebox 20 GB.
Really liked it.
Since I knew my Bose was good, I could only conclude that Archos need to improve its sound quality.
Compact design, easy PC interface.
The sound quality thru either headphone or speakers is nearly as good as CD players.
File transfer using window file manager was as convenient as can be.
Unfortunately sound quality is my #1 priority.
I don't like the bulky design and software.
But the only problem was that it doesn't come with any line-out port.
But afterall, it's the music that I want.
I plugged it in a USB port of my win2000 PC and it worked right away without additional driver installation.

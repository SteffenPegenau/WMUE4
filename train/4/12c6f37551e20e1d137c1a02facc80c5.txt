The toy bar is nice to hang toys on or rest feet on.
It protects my son from wind or sun.
We love it!
The handles adjust for height & they are paddled for comfort.
It has the see thru window in back & front & goes almost all the way down to the toy bar if needed.
The sun shade is great!!
It does take 2 hands to open & close, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy.
The wheels offer a smooth ride.
I was hesitant to buy it w/out trying it first but decided to take a chance.
!
It fits in my small sedan trunk nicely.
Part of the frame takes away some of the space but it does hold the diaper bag & some other items w/no problem.
Plus it looks great!
The storage space is okay.
We purchased this stroller about 2 mos ago.

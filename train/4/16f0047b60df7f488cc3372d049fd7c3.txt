One of the buttons near the screen does not "click", although it is working so I can live with it.
A. I don't think the shape is the best for one-hand operation.
Poor quality control from logitech on such an expensive gadget.
Full functions as advertised.
Very nice!Con: Mostly minor issues.
Hard to presee some buttons with only one hand.
Make me feel unsafe, in case I put it on a metal surface, that I may short the battery inside :(
Color screen with customized TV channel icon is a big plus.
Make sure you check all your buttons!
I heard my friend's got a bad number button as well.
Make sure you change it as the default values are too large, making control sluggish.
It even has my cheap Konka TV/ matiaDVD player pre-configured.
The RF delay is adjustable.
It has the RF which is very useful for non-lineofsight control.
C. the charging contact is at the bottom of the unit.
B.
Pro: good looking.

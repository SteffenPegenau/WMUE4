Multiple inputs for component and composite devices plus a VGA port for PC's.Cons:1.
Requires a pricey conversion cable to use.
Plenty of inputs and outputs.
Common commands like input selection require arrowing through menus instead of just scrolling through using a single button like most TV's.So far so good though.
Very competitive price.
It's my first large screen TV purchase but I researched pretty thoroughly beforehand.Pros:1.
Controls and menus could be more efficient.
It's 450 watts but that's in line with other similar plasmas.2.
Luckily, I think the component connection looks as good as the HDMI one.3.
Draws a lot of power.
Most 50" plasmas are at least $800 more.3.
Has only a HDMI input for digital whereas many devices such as PC's and cable boxes have DVI.
Beautiful picture both in HD and regular signal.
DVD's and even VHS tapes look good as well2.
I've owned this model for about six weeks now.

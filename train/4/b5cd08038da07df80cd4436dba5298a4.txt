I want to get it on DVD.
So the score isn't anything special.
The dragons look awesome.
People should at least give it a chance.
I can't believe people trying to convince other people not to see this.
The special effects are neat none the less.
The Visual Effects are pretty good.
Especially the beginning going over the water and bridges to the dungeon.
Although some of the buildings do kind of look like something George Lucas scrapped from episode one.
I still find myself humming it sometimes.
If you have seen "Neverending Story", you'll know just how much Thora Birch is made up to look like an older version of the "Childilike Empress".
The city looks cool too.
It is fun.
If you can imagine how popular dragons and unicorns are today.
So at least give this a chance.

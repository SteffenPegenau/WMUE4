I highly recommend if you purchase this or any other laptop, you buy some sort of repair plan.
My favorite feature is the switch that lets you toggle between stamina and speed.
It also comes with a Webcam and microphone which is great for video conferencing.
I like to travel and have taken this laptop everywhere with little or no problems.
Some other features include a fingerprint scanner, SD memory card reader, and Bluetooth enabled.
I purchased this laptop over a year ago and I am still very pleased with it overall.
Laptop parts are costly.I really like the compact design.
It only weighs about 4 lbs so I can move in and out of the airport terminals with no problems.
They keyboard size is great.
It is pricer than many laptops on the market.
The only downside is the cost.
It is very durable and cannot be scratched.
I bought it from Best Buy and paid for the service plan.
Since then I had to take it back once for repairs.
I also like the carbon-fiber case.

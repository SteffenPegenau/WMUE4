An eye for an eye, thats what i live by.
Even after Rosario gets revenge, you see how truly hurt and broken she is.
How could anyone not like this?
Rosario Dawson actually gets justice in this movie.
This movie shows how damaged a rape can leave someone.
I've never seen anything like it.
She actually rapes the guy who raped her.
This is the ultimate revenge movie.
-This movie is definately A MUST SEE!
The only reason i did not give it 5 stars was because it's a little to long.
However, This is still a wonderful film that i hope many people will take the time to watch.
I actually saw this about 2 years ago and it has stayed with me every since.
It's a powerful film.
It's extremely graphic to say the least.
Women are raped everyday in this country and most of these rapes go unpunished.
She's now one of my favorites.
I didn't no Rosario had this in her.
And there's this period after she was raped that seems to drag on way to long.

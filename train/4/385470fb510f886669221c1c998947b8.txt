We got it on sale before Christmas so good price as well.
The squirrels/chipmunks whatever you prefer are adorable.
She does like to chew on the lip of the stump now and then.
Which I don't really think the manufacturer had in mind but she completely ignores me when I tell her that.
He (the squirrel) is just sort of gimpy at the moment and holding on to a "shred" of his former self.
Most toys last less than an hour and then she carries around the pelt.
This pet toy is very cute.
Good product.
Very detailed construction.
Not sure how long it will last.
She's been playing with these since Christmas and only this evening decided to rip into one of the squirrels but didn't really finish the job.
Our dog is a 70 pound German short hair that lives to tear all of the stuffing out of every toy we buy her.
Immediately!!
The quality is excellent.
I showed it off to a couple of different friends and they both immediately ordered one from Amazon.

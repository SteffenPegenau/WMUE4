It is so easy to just drag files to the player using Internet Explorer with Windows XP.
I bought this product yesterday and I am crazy about it.
It would also be nice if the LCD screen had a backlight so you can read it in the dark.
The volume is great, it goes so loud!
It is a very good product for converting files.
I can't figure it out.
while still keeping it covered.
MusicMatch software is very confusing.
It is a free download.
It would be nice if the armband had a clear plastic cover so you can see the song title and press the buttons like pause, stop, fwd., bwd, etc.
To convert CDs to MP3 files, I recommend dBpowerAMP at www.dbpoweramp.com.
It is a great product.
I like the headphones and the armband, except for one thing.
I bought it for $90 at Circuit City.
It lets you choose many things, like compression size, and the destination file.Overall, this player is a very good player.

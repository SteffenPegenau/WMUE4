There will always be something that can be done better.
This is a great game.
But where are Rikishi and Kurt Angle who've been around for months?
Where's Crash Holly?
And the storyline mode is somewhat limited, but sometimes a lot of fun.
Let me be clear.
It's just not perfect, and no game ever will be.
No Tazz, no Radicals, that's understandable.
Where are Too Cool who were in WM2000 and even Attitude?
Unfortunately, the WWF has gotten a lot of great wrestlers in recent months, none of whom made the game.
Sure the create a wrestler is very limited, with not many appearances, no ability to tweak the appearances, and a somewhat limited move selection.
Great game.
He's in Hardcore's entrance video, but he's not in the game?
The gameplay is a lot of fun and that's the most important thing.
Hopefully the next game will make some big improvements, so we can find new things to complain about.

* Work and results on real sample data.
Big plus here.
No too lengthy and fuzzy discussions.
* The organization of book is clear and concise.
It helps to better understand each method and its +/-This is a good book for those who use statistics for data mining.
It helps to make drawings more attractive and to show more info.
I particularly enjoy it!
Method and technique explanations are clear though sometimes bit hard to follow.
Though a reader is expected to have good enough level in maths to grasp the concepts quickly.
Though it is clear enough and self-sufficient* There are many references and pointers to original works and related fields.
May be too bright for some.
* Liberal usage of colors.
Here are my impressions about the book.
It seems that there is more accent on probabilistic (frequentist) field.
* My parts like SVM and LDA, PCA.... they seem to be explained in quite difficult way.
May not be appropriate for the beginners in the field.

lolRICWB is an very good movie.
Just about everyone did an great job.
Although, Adam Garcia was playing an american I could hear a little bit of his australian accent, so I gave it 4 stars.
The boys who played Jason were all so cute and adorable.
I laughed.
I cried.
And I can't wait to watch it again.
I loved it.
He was good nevertheless.
When I heard that Drew was going to age in the film and have a son who was played by an actor not much older than her, I was skeptical.
Drew was excellent in the role of Beverly and with her character aging in the film she pulled off playing the different ages very well.
Even when I saw the adult scenes between them two I was still a little skeptical.
Drew B. is my very favorite actress.
After I watched their interaction with each other all my skepticism went out the window.
:)Sometimes I thought Beverly was too selfish or Ray just needed to get his act together, but everyone's human.
:)I highly recommend this film.

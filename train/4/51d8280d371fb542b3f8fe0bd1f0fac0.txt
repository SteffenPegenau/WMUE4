World class sounding.Patrick Robertson's voice is superb and extremely mature on this album.
As the other reviewer said this wasn't as rocking as previous Motorace albums.This album was promoted quite poorly by their record label.
I recall them filming the show.
Hopefully a DVD of it will be released one day.If you purchase this then also purchase Five star Laundry.
Beautiful songs.
What a shame!
The lyrics are astonishingly deep and emotional.This should have been a massive album for them.
Standout tracks "Want you", "The time, the place", "A little closer", "Not so blue".
it has such a polished sound though.
It was truly great.
It is quite possibly one of the best Australian rock albums ever created.
One of the best Australian bands.
I have a huge respect for the band for taking their music to another level.
I saw the final show in Melbourne, Australia.
Animal comes out then they break up.

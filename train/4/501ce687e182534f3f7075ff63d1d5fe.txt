He sounds much more polished and has found his own mark in the blues scene.
I was even more impressed!
I was very impressed with his guitar work.
You could see his potential.
I first heard of Kenny Wayne Shepard when his debut album came out.
!
Hope he comes to Hawaii!!
He will certainly become a blues great.
I can't wait for his third cd.
Songs like "Blue on Black" "Slow Ride""Nothing to do with Love" in fact, most of the songs he is willing to come out and establish a style he can call his own.
However, I don't think he can touch SRV.
I immediately bought his second cd.
He's definately a gifted person.
Sure, you can still hear some SRV riffs but the KWSB is coming into their own.
His guitar expressions could almost pass for Stevie Ray Vaughn.

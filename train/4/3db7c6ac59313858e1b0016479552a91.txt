DVD/CDRW is really handy on a lappie3.
What I did not like is that it has only 1 PS/2 Port which means that either you can connect a mouse or a keyboard but not both simultaneously.
Only 1 PS/2.
Bought this lappie a week ago.
DVDs play fine and display is decent.
Can connect an external keybord or Mouse, but not both2.
Affordable; Good value for money5.
S-Video Out4.
System freezes occasionally when mouse connected to PS/23.
Gets over heated if not placed on a completely flat surface5.
Could not find the specs but I suspect that the FSB rating is not really good.
RAM upgradable to 1GB2.
Ctrl key at an awkward location (not the leftmost in the bottom row)4.
Futhermore I noticed that when I connect a mouse the system freezes occasionally for a second completely (the sound as well as display).If you research well you will get this one for *well* below $... with mail in rebates and other discounts.Overall a decent machine for the price.Pros:1.
Light for its priceCons:1.

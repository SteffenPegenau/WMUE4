I would compare Auster with Susan Sontag.
Well known author, a novelist.
Essays and fiction.
Sontag's style is similar to Auster's one.
So this book is a good one in two aspects: composition and the essays itself.
Well, it always seems to me in every book that there could be something more.
Although it is not a fiction, you can still notice that he is discussing about the same problems as he does in he's novels.
Like Auster is trying to prove that his standpoints in novels are true.
But this is a great book, no doubt about that.
No, it's better if we inspect this writer without any restrictions.
Because he is unmeasureable.
Paul Auster?
All these essays are each one involved with a self-seeking.
So, why I put only 4 stars.
Beyond the Red Notebook: Essays on Paul Auster, this is one of the best essaycollections i've ever read.

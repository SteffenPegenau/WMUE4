I just haven't messed with it enough to know just yet.
Adequate amount of designs to choose from too.
Works with PC only and not Macs.
I've applied them to CDs and tested them with success.
It gives you simple instructions on how to calibrate it though, and my second try was on point.
I mainly bought it to print labels for DVD media.
The label applicator was easy to figure out and worked good.
Especially for a starter kit.
After installing the software and giving it a test run, the printing was a little offset.
This is a great starter kit for making basic labels.
The labels were good as well.
I am sure there is a way to print your own design to it too.
Worth picking up.
My OS that I'm using it with is Windows Vista Home Premium.
Fairly simple to use as far as setting up what design and font you want to print to the label.

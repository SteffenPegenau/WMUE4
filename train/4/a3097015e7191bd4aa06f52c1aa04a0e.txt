It's not as bad as "The Red Balloon" DVD (nothing is!
Don't expect more.
)I will just talk about the quality of the DVD.
not even "Meet The Feebles").
I won't expound on the story since everyone else already has.
It is not great...just okay.
It is pure CAMP!
(I bet most of the reviewers on this page weren't alive then.
Even the beginning song is missing a few frames at the start.Don't get me wrong.
Look for a bargin.
(I bet you didn't know that Martians read and write in English too.
Just don't pay top dollar for it.
It has all of the blemishes that you see on the film when broadcast on t.v..
Keep in mind it was made back in 1964.
They even label some equipment in their ship as "radar box"!)
Either you liked it as a child or not.

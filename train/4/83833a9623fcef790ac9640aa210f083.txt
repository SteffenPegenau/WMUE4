It was missing.
It was delivered on Weds afternoon!
It was thinner than the bar drinks I've had.
Maybe all I need is practice.
I ordered the Margaritaville DM1000 on Cyber Monday night.
The blades are very sharp.
I phoned the manufacturer.
I purchased this model as you can make drinks by the glass or by the pitcher.
Talk about fast, thanks Amazon!
It was supposed to come with a free party guide.
I have used it once so far.
It is very well made.
It is easy to use.
It will be fun to try!
My drink was not quite the consistency I expected.
It is being sent to me.

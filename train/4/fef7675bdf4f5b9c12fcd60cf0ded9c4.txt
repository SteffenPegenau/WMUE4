i'm not into sci-fi, but i recognize some of the satire, although perhaps not all.
both living on a planet (earth) to be destroyed.
the characters are very interesting.
the dialogue funny.
an improbability machine.
there's a depressed robot named marvin.
dolphins and rats.
there will be a lot of things going on.
actually, writing a review is very strange.
great, lovely, funny details.
they got to get away from the planet.
designers.
there are these 2 people: ford and arthur.
his ideas are really far-out, very fantastic, and great.
nasty creatures.
the president, zaphod.
rats conducting observations with humans, etc.
there is however, more to it.
adams must be experienced.
but there is also "common" satire, weird ideas, amusing dialogue....

He arranged some of this album.
The Clientele seems to have created another brilliant record, that is its own world, and doesn't really care was is in fashion.
That guy was really into lush productions of the 1960s.
Cornelius also explored this music.
There was nothing going on and I was tired of seeing another garage rock band.
Songs like "My Own Face Inside The Trees" are wonderful.
I was only slightly familiar with them.
I was asked to review their first album.
They are a cool band.
I didn't really know if they were from England or Ohio.
The guitarist had a distinct style of playing that was unique.
I was into Louis Philippe a few years ago too.
Three years ago I saw The Clientele play in Boston.
There is a bookish and a sonic ability that is quite charming.
They seemed like something like The Beatles and The Byrds.
Stuff like Joe Meek and the Mamas and the Papas.

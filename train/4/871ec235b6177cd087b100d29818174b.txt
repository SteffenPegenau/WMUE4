It seems to take a bit longer than my Dad's Nuvi 350 to get a GPS signal.
The 350 does not.
Very happy with it.
I live 30 miles west of Pittsburgh, and cannot pick up the signal.
The 350 will pick up a signal in my basement, not the 680.
Still not that big of a deal.
If you live in a big city MSN works fine.
Overall, is simple to use, and trustworthy.
The 680 will lose the GPS signal when driving through the Fort Pitt tunnels (Pittsburgh, PA).
Bluetooth connects fine.
Just a few minor issues.
I will not pay for this service when my free subscription runs out.
This feature would be nice if it covered more area, but it's useless on the PA Turnpike, or other major highways.
The map shows I should.
I used the 680 for a month now.

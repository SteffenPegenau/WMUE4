And that's what really matters.
Madonna proves again how she can be exceptional, mutable, different.
This album is very good.
Few are very good, some are good, others OK and very few are boring (not exactly bad).
So the outcome is above the avarage.
This CD is very personal and everything is about her, including the title: her American Life.
At least, people go to discos and night clubs to dance.Some songs are boring.
Some people are bothered by her "selfishness", but just in case you are one of those people, don't listen to CD.
It's a good album.
The beat is great as well as the rhythm.
Unlike most artists, she changes style as she change clothes in the show.
I'd say the songs are irregular.
Simple as that.
She likes to take chances and that's good since artists in general are on the safe side.The lyrics aren't an exemple of literature and certainly won't be recommended at universities or schools.
But who cares?

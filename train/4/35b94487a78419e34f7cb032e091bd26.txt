He insists on taking it with him everywhere.
and so far... this vacuum is his favorite!
He wants to help.
It has a light and makes sound as well...
Yes, it is small...
It is the perfect size for my son...
He is almost 36" tall.
!
It has vacuumed lawns, sidewalks etc.I have purchased a ridiculous amount of "stuff" for my son... toys, books, games etc.
This vacuum has now been to the park, the beach and taken many elevator rides.
He is so cute with the vacuum...
I ultimately picked this dirt devil.
Everytime he heard the vacuum in my house, he would run to it...
:) I decided to get him one and I was goingto get the Dyson looking vacuum because it looks like ours, but the reviews swayed me.
My son is 19 months old and absolutely loves this vacuum.

Wow.
Jesus!
ESPECIALLY if you're one of those crazy feminists.
GORGEOUS vocals, interesting rhythm, and that guest appearance by Peter Gaberiel blew me away.
Paula Cole, Sarah McLachlan, Fiona Apple, Alanis Morisette!!!!!!
was a complete and utter moron.
That guy (and it was oh so obvious he was a guy, either that or a disgrace to women.)
Being raised on just "Sledgehammer", "Steam", etc.
as examples of his work, I was suprised he had such a deep and powerful voice.Simply put, great cd, buy it.
They're taking over the airwaves!!!
Not another one of those horrible feminist singers!!!
Did anybody read the review from that d***head who said Paula was "just another angry feminist"?
Pure and simple, this cd was fantastic.
Oh no!
We'll all be killed!

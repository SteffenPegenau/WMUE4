Probably my favorite song on the album.
Nothing extraordinary or new...but not bad at all.
It's a shame that it'll probably not sell over 500,000 copies.
I can just see the record execs telling Doyle to at least put one song on the album that sounds like something you'd hear on modern radio.
I'm not going to go on to describe each song...but it is mixed bag of a variety of different styles.
"Problem Child" is very good.
The first thing you'll think when you hear it is Lenny Kravitz.
"Green Light Girl" is that song.
The song goes from slow, blues-inspired, Hendrix-like guitar riffs to an all out guitar frenzy..and then back again.
Very good, solid album.
My kinda guitar.
Doyle has been trying to shake the SRV wannabe moniker for some time, and I think his last two albums have done just that.
It's not the type of music that radio will give a chance...and that's a shame.
The album starts out with his single "Green Light Girl".
It has that kind of a vibe to it.

Don't Let It End(10/10)4.
He sings very low and bad.
He also sings ugly on Heavy Metal poisoning.
The voice of James Young isn't so good on this album.
I know this album is not as good as Crystal Ball, The Grand Illusion, Pieces Of Eight or Paradise Theater, but it is worth 4 stars for sure!
Beneath you can see how I rate the songs:1.
If you are new with Styx you should buy The Grand Illusion, Crystal Ball or Pieces Of Eight.
I see a lot of bad reviews here, I can't understand why.
Haven't We Been Here Before(10/10)9.
Cold War(8/10)3.
The only bad song on this album is Double Life.
Double Life(4/10)8.
Don't Let It End Reprised(8/10)I don't recommend this album if you are new with Styx.
Heavy Metal Poisoning(6/10)6.
Mr. Roboto(8/10)2.
High Time(8/10)5.
Just Get Through This Night(10/10)7.
If you are a Styxfan and you like Cornerstone and Paradise Theater, then this is something for you.

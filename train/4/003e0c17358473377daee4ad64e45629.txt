There are plenty of good characters, laughs, and action.
I can't give 5 stars to an unfinished work.
The story is pretty solid as well.
Even so it's still worth watching.
I believe it's worth 4 stars b/c it leaves ya hanging.
However, if they finish it it'll probably get 5 stars.
Cecily and Luke must fight to protect their country from the evil demons.This series is well made.
She becomes friends with Luke and begs him to forge a magic katana for her.
It was released in 2009, so there may be a possibility for a 2nd season.
It has good animation, voice actors, and a good soundtrack.
Cecily is a knight.
Unfortunately she ends up getting saved more than she ends up saving people.
An mystery man is unleashing demons on the land.
It doesn't finish though.
On one such occasion she is saved by the blacksmith, Luke.
I liked this series and I recommend it to any anime fan.

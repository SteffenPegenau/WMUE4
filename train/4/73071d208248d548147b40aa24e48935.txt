Mr. Morrison had not idea that I was in the light before and now here.
Once again thank you for reading this letter and may you travel in peace too.
I know live in the body of man named Gregory Morrison.
Again it is nice to be able to walk on the earth and see and do those things that I never really had the the chance to do.
We come back and forth from the world sometime only once but sometimes 2 or 3 times in our new life or heavely place.
Driving a new car, having the proper medical care when needed, cable TV, and just a better life totally.
Ms. Brooks
His children are from the light too.
I was born in 1873 and died in 1933.
I had 3 children.
I hope that he will achieve those things in his life time that I did not or was not able to achieve.
I have waited for the right moment to let him know this.
Mr. Morrison is married and has 2 children of his own.
I died at an earlier age due to radariation.
Mr. Morrison is handing everything very well.
In my past life I was Ms. Brooks.

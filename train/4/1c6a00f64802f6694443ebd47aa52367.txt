Pete's deep, manly voice whines about what its like "not being the prettiest girl in the world" to a funky Kraftwerk beat, robot vocoder included.
Especially "Turn Around And Count To Ten".
U2's "Even Better Than the Real Thing" is fun and high energy (better than U2's Real Thing).
"I Promise Myself" sound much of a cheez-fest as well.
"Isn't It A Pity" is hallarious.
Yikes.
Like Captain Hollywood Project or LaBouche hijacked our beloved Pete, held a gun to his head and forced him to belt out this crap.Included in sleeve is "our king of the she-male race" flawless in Westwood.
Even to a jaded club goer like me.
"I Paralyze" features his growling vocals at their best with some PHAT analogue synth sounds you never heard before.
Some of the 2000 remixes are dreadful.
"Belts, boots, up to his thighs, thick mascara all around his eyes!"
"Lover Come Back To Me" is easier to cope with.
Amazing.
Hit and Run lover sounds like their old stuff, in a good pop-o-rama way.
Not flawless though.
Instant hit.

It won't live up to the hype, but it won't be forgotten in the back of the CD shelf either.
At first listen I couldn't believe all the hype in the industry about her.
But this CD is a good listen.
"Your Lies" is a good pop song, but over produced.
There are no bad songs on this CD.
There just aren't any earth shaking monsters, either.
My faves are "Leavin'" & "Gotta Get Back".
I'm already going for a third listen.
But after I realized I was angry at the reviewer, I listened again.Shelby has put together a nice CD here.
No, she isn't Dusty or Aretha.
"This is just one of those albums that you like more every time you listen to it.
She covers a great range of styles, and does them all well.I also went back and forth between 3 or 4 stars for a rating.
I felt taken.
Hell, she isn't even Sheryl Crow.
I had to listen to this CD twice to review it honestly.
I decided on 4 stars when I found myself humming "Why Can't You Be?

The author writes well, but rarely have I read a book that left so many "untied" loose ends.
Or did it?
There were many hints throughout the book as to who the bad guy/gal was, but most of these hints were never resolved one way or another.
And what about Pete Carlson?
.
And what about the homeless guy stealing the animal doorknockers??
(I sincerely would like someone to explain this book to me - I'm not kidding.)
Did he spill the beans about Joy and Bill at the convention?
Did he remain as anchor or did Yelena finally get rid of him?
They mentioned it several times and then .
Can someone please tell me how that fit in with the rest of the book?
Were all of these simply "red herrings," or did the whole plot just go right over my head?
.
nothing!
For example, what was the deal with "the mole"?
Unless I missed something?

Keep doing your thing.
There are some pretty notable tracks, all in all I'm glad Cuban Link was finally able to get his music out some way some how after 24 Carats or whatever was shelved.
I loved Cuban Link ever since his early days with TS.
True fans have your back!
This album is a very solid release.
I look forward to more releases from Cuban.
No.
No.
But he offers solid verse after verse even when his production is a little lagging (sorry Swizzy, you didn't bring the heat on this album).
Is his lyrical content going to change the way you listen to hip-hop?
If you're a fan of Pun's and want something close (like the generic brand of your favorite cereal) this album is worth the dough.
That's strictly opinion, but at least Cuban stepped up with "Flowers for the Dead."
Somehow, I feel that Cuban had a stronger connection to Pun then did Fat Joe.
I hate to compare him to this, but his sound is not that far removed from TS or the late, great Pun.
Is he breaking new ground?

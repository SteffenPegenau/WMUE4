1.

The book is divided by states in alphabetical order with information on the railroads, such as when they run, phone numbers and maps with the routes and major local roads.
Photographs of each railroad would have been good.
Do you need to make reservations so you don't get there and find out you can't board?
4.
Local transit, airports, Greyhound or Amtrak terminals and their distance from the railroad should have been listed.

That's because you can only have one at a time.
After beating the game you might just say it's worth your money, I guess.
Multiplayer could've been great.
Ammo is limited.
The entire game is interesting.
There were also many good reviews.
The surroundings are monotonous and bland.
The weapons are unique and fun, but there is no real depth to the weapon system.
The codes are fun and add re-play value.
The truth is I can't tell you if you'll like it or not, it all depends on your preference.
The story is great if you love anime.
The controls aren't beautiful, but can be dealt with after awhile.
If you don't like sports games, then get it.
That can be changed by using the glassworld code, everything shatters when shot at.
Graphics could've been much better too.
The best thing in this game is the innocent civilians that beg for heir life when you beat on them.
A lot of people gave Oni a bad review, including some magazines.

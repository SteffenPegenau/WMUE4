But really, it's good.
That annoyed me to no end.
Who wanted to read about 'Mary-sue's?
It's more a cliche kind of kid book.
I think it beats 'Eragon' by a long shot, and I think the author's next book will be better.
Go buy it!
They were all so PRETTY.
The author shows potential, though I don't think this will be her best work.
It's not a particularly brillant book, but it's good.
The characters.
But I got over it, and I loved reading it.
It kept me interested, and I wanted to keep reading it.
"The Prophecy of the Stones" is a fun read.
I'd also like to add that if you're an adult, you may not like it much.
The dialogue could have been better, and only one other think irked me.

What a joy it is to read something by someone who knows how to write.
The message however seemed mixed and somewhat confused.
Not to diet?
It was a great read by a very good writer.
To diet?
Unfortunate....but true.
For many people, to stay thin (or thin enough for them) a 'normal appetite' is a diet.
I still loved the book.
I must commend the author for her excellent writing.
To be thin?
To be thin enough?
Just what is the author looking for?
I was not at all sure just what the author was saying (or trying to say?).
I agreed with much of her statements, but in the end, I felt her general concluding remarks did not really make sense.
It seems impossible to me that after a lifetime of yo-yo eating one could find what the author describes as one's 'normal appetite'.

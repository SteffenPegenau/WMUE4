It is Very late seventies.
Basically, it's only drawback is its "dated" sound.
If I'm not, it's a little flat.
20 years ago I would have given this 5 stars.
The title track is a fine counterpoint to the pop element.
Maynard gets the same bad rap that Harry James got back in the day (technical flare over substance), but I just put that down to "high note" envy.
And even though it contains the slightly cheesy themes from Rocky and Star Trek, the album actually works on many levels.
There is a lot going on.
When I'm in that seventies mood, it's great.
Today 4 stars.
The musicianship is excellent.
The rhythm section is ridiculously tight and funky.
2 years ago 5 stars.
"The Fly" is funky fun.
10 years ago 4 stars.

In any case, I'm on to the next one.
I don't think it has to do with my internet connection or my PC either because I watched other videos with no problems.
Since I have some extra days off with the Thanksgiving holiday, I figured I would start watching the Twilight series to see what all the fuss is about.
There are a lot of things in this movie that I didn't know about when it comes to vampires.
There was just enough action, romance and intensity.
I must say this first one is very good!
I checked my screen saver which was off.
I haven't watched a vampire movie since the 80s or 90s!
Only I'm gonna just watch it on Demand or Redbox.
The chemistry between Bella and Edward whew!
So annoying!
My connection kept going from high to low.
The video kept freezing and buffering.
I like how it's more contemporary and up to date.
Now, I wouldn't recommend watching it on Amazon Instant Video as I did.

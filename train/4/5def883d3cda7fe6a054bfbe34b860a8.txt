But otherwise, it's a great CD to play at parties of whatever.
The third shouldn't even be on the CD - it's some disco thing from the 70s.
Plus I wanted to have "Slaughter on 10th Avenue" and "I Feel Fine" [a Beatles cover].
This was the second Ventures CD I ever bought.
First of all, the sound quality is excellent stereo with great separation.
The 2-LPs-on-1-CD format grabbed me.
Next, the performances are simply awesome.The Ventures are so much fun to listen to; it makes you want to go out there and play those songs yourself!
"The Savage" was a B-side.
Excuse me for being a salesman.
Buy it now.
The second, I don't know about.
).The first 2 of the three bonus tracks are in mono.
The covers of hits of the day are fun (I Feel Fine, Gone Gone Gone, Hang On Sloopy, Oh Pretty Woman, etc.
Just about every song is extremely listenable.
So I ordered this CD, and liked it immediately after I put it on.

Well, I hope you have enjoyed my review.
Think of it as a giga pet kind of thing.3.

No opinions.
Training Mode.
People who have patience to master Virtua Fighter 4 will definitly see their gaming skills grow.
The one thing that makes VF4 stand out amoung the rest is the A.I.
Yu Suzuki really out did himself.
When I played this game for the first time I was so amazed how each fighting techinique was shown.
(This is a fact!)2.
All this was facts about the game.
The graphics are one thing you should not take for granted in the game.
You get create, that's right create, your own custom fighter and teach it new techiniques.
...If you love martial arts this is the game for you.
Let's just say it's pretty.4.

It is only glued and apparently not that well.
- about treating books well especially around little kids.
I recommend trying to find a HB copy... this is too good a book to miss!
HOWEVER...
But I'm going to be looking to replace it with a HB, because it is very much loved.
I never tire of reading it.
I bought the paperback, because I was having trouble finding a HB copy.
This book remained put up and we would get it out 2-3 times a day and sit in the chair and read it together.
I am very careful - okay... neurotic!
It's especially good in conjunction with FIAR and Homeschoolshare.
My two and four y/o love this book; and I do too!
And the illustrations are fabulous, too!
Then the next night more pages began to loosen.
I can't say enough about what a great story this is.
out of the book and onto the floor.
There was absolutely no abuse to the book, but after two weeks pages 1-16 fell plop!
I guess I'm going to staple it together for now.

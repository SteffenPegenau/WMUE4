I have to or I won't get paid.
Buy it.
Worth every penny and that says a lot because the damn thing went on sale on Black Friday 3 days after I bought it.
I am so in love.
I feel 500 times better instantly!!
I was kinda irked but now it's here and I could care less how much I paid for it.
I also work from home and spend hours on the computer.
I'm going to be whispering tales of love to it for the rest of the week.
You will be glad you did.
I love it.
I love this chair more than anything.
I have HORRIBLE sciatica and this week it has been so bad it reduces me to a blithering pile of tears and curse word.
I had a regular yoga ball I have sat on for the last 2 years and that was cool but this is WAAAAAY better.
Okay I have to say I have never written a review on Amazon until now.
This chair feels amazing on my back.

You'll get it when you listen to it.
Too bad there's no picture of the CD on this site.
The engineering on this CD is absoultely phenomenal.
Try walking in someone elses shoes.
Talk about eclectic and multi-faceted!
Heavy King Crimson and Zappa influences.
Really cool graphics.
Great sounding CD.
Kind of felt like I was riding a neural cart over his synaptic rollercoaster.
The music isn't just for listening...you can actually hear a cognitive process.
"Hang-up your receiver when finished."
Some absoultely hilarious liner notes.
He has a unique ability to reflect lyrical disonance within his structure of music.
This guy gets involved in so many different styles and does all of them justice.
Something that lets the listener take his journey into the mundane dimensia of everyday life.
Not an easy task.

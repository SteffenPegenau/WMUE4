I ADORE the swimming pool but I won't skip to describing another toy!
It is SOOO fun!
The mat smells really lovely on the back!
You honestly won't be dissapointed!
There is a pavement and a beach and shops and houses for friends and you could put clothes galore on the little hang-rails!
They are not EXCITING enough!
I have seen LOADS of Jackie's reviews but she does boring reviews.
It is especially cool if you get the Polly swimming pool!
All I can say is; GET THIS TOY!
They are always so good!
Hope this review helps, Bye!
I love to make my tamagotchi live on it!
SO MANY THINGS TO DO!
I ADORE this mat!
I am starting to think that it is purposely scented!
My pollies adore it!
And just take a look at this mat!
I LOVE Pollies!

The music works as a whole.
I happened to be in a record store when I heard what was playing over the store speakers.
It was hypnotic!
It's not for everyone but for those who enjoy music that makes you feel then Mira is a passionate choice.
Very Cure like.
I was automatically drawn in by the vocals and guitar work.
Regina's vocals are so captivating and enchanting.
I've had this cd for 5 months or so and I still listen to it regularly!
I discovered Mira by chance.
Not flashy or abrasive.
I stood there and listened to 2 or 3 songs and loved every one of them.
I love music that carries with vocals that makes makes you feel.
It was like being struck by lightning.
This was the music loved.
The guitar work is so haunting.

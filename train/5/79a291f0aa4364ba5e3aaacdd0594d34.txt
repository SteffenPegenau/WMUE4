their recent one thoguh is good, "Golden State" is a good record.recommendedpeace
I give it a five b/c its their best album to date.
Nirvana cannot be compared to anything.
It still to this day gets often radio play.
One of their more popular tracks.
they say that Bush is a lot like Nirvana.
A good one.
Worth the time.A decent album.
Usually teh first one is.
one highlight of this album.Comedown - of course this one is a great track.
And Bush is more upbeat than Nirvana ever was.Everything Zen - is one that most know.
This is jsut one of those songs that sticks in your mind a long time.
It just flows and i don't know too many people that don't like it.Machinehead - the most recognizable Bush song.
Thats an insult to both bands.
I think not.
A little overrated considering the rest of the album.Glycerine - a good slow track.
A good song.
a good start to the album.Little Things - One of the best tracks by Bush, this gets a lot of air play still.
The others get a little bad.

Very deep and realistic film .
Very solid 5 stars .
I was in the office ... a clerk ,- he unswers .
We don't know , which one ... but we do .
Russian policeman asked him , what exsecly he did there ...
After few minutes he gets our full attention .
Exellent soundreck too .PS : As Afghan veteran , I can feel Sergey Bodrov's character ...
Passing by a first scene of the movie ... at wrong place , at wrong time .
He is so lost in fake reality of modern Russia ...
But we know , he didn't .
Very quiet , simple , coldblooded and likebale guy .
We realise , he just cameback from the war .
We understand , that he crossed his line in other place , and now he just doing his job - surviving himself , and saving his brother and few friends from agony and brutality of " NEW " mother Russia .
And we glad , he did .
Honest and lifesmart .
Just a kid .
This film reminded me American movie " Coldblooded ".

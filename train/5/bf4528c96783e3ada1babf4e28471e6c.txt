I do my best to get the word out for them because I think it'll save the lives of many pets.
It works instantly instead of taking days/weeks like the more "popular" brands of odor products.
Most people are stunned with the fact that it actually works instantly.
I run a pet sanctuary and pet consulting business.
I've researched it well and have used it for years.
It's completely safe so I don't have to rinse it which saves time.
I also use it on dogs that have rolled in dead animals, or have doggy odor.
I use it on everything, even hiking shoes, not just pet-related odors!
I'm convinced that it is safe to use directly on pets and people.
I promise.
I have recommended this product to everyone with pets.
This is a small company with an excellent product- do not pass it up because you haven't heard of it.
It seems to good to be true, but it's true.
Inappropriate urination is the #1 reason pet cats are turned into shelters.

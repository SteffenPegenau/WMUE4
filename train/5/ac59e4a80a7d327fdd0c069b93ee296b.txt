But with Unfold The Future, there is nothing but greatness.
!
Not a bad song in between either.
Unlike others, I have found things to love and not love about all their other cd's.
The two bookend epics are simply the best the band has ever made.
I have all of the Flower Kings cd's and sit in awe of the majestic and beauty of this new piece of music.
Mr. Stolt has upped the anny for all other in this style of music.
Each song flows into the next like they were made for each other and when it is all done, it is not unlikely to go through it all again.
Long live The Flower Kings!!
The bass is right where it belongs, up front for us to enjoy, but not overpowered.
Any style of prog rock you enjoy you will find here.
Now that Neil Morse has called it quits, we have one true prog super group.
And the new drummer is truly one of the best I've ever heard.
This is really that good.
He has put together a revamped lineup that blows away the past band.

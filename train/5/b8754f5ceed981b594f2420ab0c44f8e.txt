And it hasn't lost any of its greatness!!!!
Just had to write a review.
As I sit here and listen to "Miracle," it dawns on me that this album is 20 years old!!!!
I already luved LA and Babyface's work, so for them to get with Whitney made it even better.
1 of my favorites.
I never get tired of it!
I've read some other reviews, and I must agree: this is my favorite of all her albums!!
Wow!
Don't sleep on this album!
The title track is my JAM!
Can U believe it!?
I can't say enough about this album!!!
It always sounds brand new to me.
I can listen to it from start to finish.

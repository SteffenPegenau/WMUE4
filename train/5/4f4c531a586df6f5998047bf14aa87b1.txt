Next I compared it to the Jornada and the Ipaq.
The Ipaq beat it out in one area only - speed - but barely.
In a side by side test the Ipaq only opened programs a fraction of a second faster with the single exception of MS Reader where the Ipaq was much faster.
In this case, the EM 500 is actually cheaper!
THe Ipaq just looked a little washed out.
Memory?
If I have to choose between the Ipaq or EM 500 at the same price, The EM 500 wins especially with its free memory card.
With the Jornada, there was again no comparison.
Size?
Screen?
The Ipaq and EM-500 are comparible.
I compared them side by side at Best Buy and everyone around me chose the EM 500.
The EM 500 at Christmas was [$] with a free 28 meg card.
That gives it 44 megs of total memory compared to Ipaq's 32 megs at [$100 more].
The EM 500 wins hands down.
I compared my EM-500 to a Palm and there was no comparison.

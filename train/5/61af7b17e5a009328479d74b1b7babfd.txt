The first song "Live Out Loud" is incredible, and if you are like me you will listen to it over and over untill it drives you crazy!!
As I looked over the other reveiws I was pleased.
I also love Jesus is Life, Bring it On, God is God, See the glory, Declaration of Dependence, and more!
Almost all of them were crazy for the cd or they atleast liked it.
WoW!
!
Let me tell you, it is incredible!He is an awesome musician and judging by his songs, a faithful chrisitan too!
That is the way it should be for this cd.
I found out about his newest cd Declaration and I got it!
Finally, I found out it was some guy called Stephen Curtis Chapman.I've been a fan ever since!
I had to know!
The day I heard "DIVE" from his album Speechless, I was blown away!
Who is this guy?
Five stars!!
It is a great cd.

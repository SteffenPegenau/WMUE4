I wouldn't still be sticking by her 20 yrs.
Cyndi has the talent and the courage to do her own thing, without worrying what anyone else thinks.
She sings her a** off and her heart out.
She makes this world a better place to live in.
This DVD proves that over and over again...
You can have them.
And that voice is like none other.
Who needs those other boring and disposable pop acts.
Her talent just overwhelms me.
She's the only one left in music imo, who has the courage to be exactly who she is.
She's 51 yrs old, looks no more than 28 & in amazing shape.
They bore me to tears!!!
Even if you're not the consumate Lauper fan, there's still no denying her amazing vocal talent.
She's completely unpretentious and loaded with unbelievable energy & talent.
She interacts with her fans, by running into the audience and making them feel like they matter.
later if she sold her soul to pop music "sellout" hell.

Hide and Seek is one song that will ruffle your feathers, getting under the skin, boiling emotions to the surface.
If you are looking for a powerful new musician, in a period when inspiration seems null / void, try this CD.
Goosebumps, tears, whatever was within came right out.
I fell apart right then and there.
I don't know how I came across this, I heard she sang for Frou Frou and I enjoyed her voice so much I tried a download from her.
because I don't watch TV, so this came as a complete surprise.
If you are in love or love lost, this music will embrace you, hug you and you will feel love.
God has obviously blessed Imogen Heap.
I thought I was going to explode.
My only review is this CD from Imogen Heap.
I'm telling you it overtook me.
I've never heard of O.C.
I'm not one to write reviews or listen to much electriconica music but this one is notably exceptional.
I will share this music with everyone I know.
From the heavens above.

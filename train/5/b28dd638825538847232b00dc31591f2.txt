I looked into various PA systems for our Rotary club.
Sometimes the amp buzzes a bit then goes away.
It looked good for our purposes and the price was amazing, under $130!
But it was too heavy to move easily and it did not have the capacity for a wireless microphone.
Both mikes are shielded on the sides, so you have to speak right into the center of the mike about one inch away.
I found the Pyle PWM-A600 and read the reviews.
It worked perfectly for a room with about 60 people.
We have a great PA built into a lecturen.
Great buy!I Love You Madly!
Our techies liked the Pyle PWM-A600, so we decided to try it.
On Passion, Personality and Personal Growth, second edition
It been great so far for these 3 months.
I bought a lavaliere mike at Radio Shack for $50 and it works well with it.
Our club was conflicted about buying a new PA system, when many cost $1000 on up.
I found some other systems and sent the information to my board.

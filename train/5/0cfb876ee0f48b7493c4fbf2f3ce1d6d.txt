She dealt with it all very well though.
The Diary of Anne Frank is a very interesting book.
If only her family read her diary.
Her life was so complicated.
A 14 or 15 year old girl could not have written this!"
There was more to Anne Frank than what met the eye.
What I liked about it is how she has so much personality in her diary.
It was like she meant it to be a book all along.
Way too complicated then a 14/ 15-year-old's life should be.
Anne Frank was a very smart girl.
Thanks to her diary we all know the real Anne Frank!-Ashlyn Roberts
The whole time I was reading it, I was thinking to myself, "Was this book edited?
It sounds so god!
No one actually knew what types of things she went through.
If they read that diary, then everyone would have been so much appreciative of her.
She deserved to have been treated better.
She was so different from the rest of her family, and they didn't get that.

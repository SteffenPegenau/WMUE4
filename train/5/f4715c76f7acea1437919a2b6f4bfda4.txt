Buy every album from Killswitch Engage.
This CD was released in July of 2000, when "nu-metal" was the big thing.
This band is not sold out and you know it.
Buy this album, along with the other two albums.
"The End Of Heartache" may have some cheesy lyrics at some times, but it's the music that counts.
Don't read that guy's review underneath mine.
Sellout bands are Green Day, Linkin Park and Hoobastank.
No one knew about them then.
They will grow on you.
Even if a lot of people know of them today, they can still shred it!
Even if they did get nominated for a Grammy, they didn't win.
Every track is brilliant.
I hate it when people say that Killswitch Engage collapsed.Anyways, this CD is a classic for the heavy metal generation.
Killswitch Engage still have it, even though they now have some members from Blood Has Been Shed.
"Temple From The Within" and "Vide Infra" are two examples of classics off this great CD.

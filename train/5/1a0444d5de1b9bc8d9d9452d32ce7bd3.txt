Looking into His Big Beautiful Eyes makes me melt.
I love the song "Before we Say Goodybye" Secondly the songs are so funny and they always make me happy and laugh!
Even though it isn't all that long Its a great CD!
I'm so glad I got this CD.
He is so talented and cute and (sigh) ok I need to calm down!
The movie is so awsome & the movie is even better!
Thirdly: I LOVE NOAH BASTIAN!
(sigh) When I look at him I always start to sing "2gether me and you 4ever" or "U+ME=US".
I definatly recommend buying this CD!
You will always be the Michael in My heart!
Noah!
If that isn't convincing enough, then just look at those 5 fine guys on the cover of the CD!
OK for starters I would just like to say that the movie was extremely funny that I knew I had to go out and get the CD and I'm glad I did!
HE IS JUST TO HOTT!
<~~had to have seen the movie to understand!
I LOVE NOAH!

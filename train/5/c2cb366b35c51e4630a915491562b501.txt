On a few occasions though, this did not happen.
99% of the time, it shuts off after two hours.
No problem!
I thought it could have been caused by a power outage resetting the clock, but the time was not affected.
Friends and family beg me to make coffee when they visit just so they can use it.
This coffee pot supersedes all other coffee pots.
Even without the auto shut-off, the pot is worth it.
It's only happened twice, but I keep a close watch on it now.
A couple of slight problems that I've experienced are the auto shut-off and tall travel cups.
Hands down.
Go get one today!
They all think it's fabulous.
Really the tall travel cups are not a problem, you either move it toward the front of the counter or slightly tilt the cup.
As for the shut-off mechanism, I'm not sure.
After buying it for myself and loving it, I bought it for my parents and my mother-in-law.
The coffee tastes great, it fits under my cupboard, and it's super easy to clean.
Who knows?

Good decisions : Happy Consequences.
Poor decisions: sad consequences.
It does not happen to you!You happen to it!We r not victims !For everything that happens in life there is a decision I can make that will make the outcome manageable.
Work begins to feel like a punishment.
For most of us, life feels like a movie we've arrived at forty-five minutes late.Something important seems to be going on .
But.
You fall out of love, or perhaps the other person falls out of love with you.
Everything starts to feel like an endless routine.Life happens.
.
maybe.
But tragic things happen too.
You find that work that is yours alone to fulfill.
.
You meet someone, fall in love.

I mean, good things do happen, sometimes beautiful things.

Down-to-earth.
Inspiring.
Morgainne's growth as a person is what inspires this novel.
Spell-binding.
SPIRITUAL!
And those of you who do not like it, please, reconsider, reread, and learn.
The absolute best novel ever.
Read and learn.
And I say that as a literature fan and a history major.
Whimsical.
Real.
Moral.
Bradley is amazing in her writing and her imagination is to be envied.
Fantasy.
This book is what every parent attempts to teach their child.
Amazing.
The faults of all the characters prove the shallowness and wastefulness of bigotry.
Anyone who does not see the story, the depth, the character, the ingenuity, or the moral of this story learned nothing in school.

And I know my Motorhead - all the way back to 1975.Go do yourself a favor and "discover" this band.
Without the blues, hard rock is flavorless.
Lemmy will tell you why: It's because Motorhead is a blues band.
Motorhead has the hardest flavor of anyone.
Each one of those albums rock - better than anything else out there.
They also had a great live album in 99.
It's a CRIME that this band doesn't get the respect it deserves.
That's it.
Take your time.
Motorhead had studio albums in 91,92,93,95,96,98,00,02,and 04.
You'll say to yourself: "These guys really are the best!
Nobody can out play them."
Inferno is their all time best work.
Then one day it will hit you like a ton of bricks.
Compare Motorhead with Metallica since 1991: Metallica had studio albums in 91, 96 (Load and Reload were from the same sessions), 98 (Garage Inc. was old and new), and St. Anger from last year (puke).

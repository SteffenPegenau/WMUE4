I really enjoy this album.
The album for me is already aging well sounding better with every listen.
Demure was an amazing album, full of great vocals and guitar riffs.
They had to borrow instruments just to finish their tour.
I feel every album they have made was another step forward.
The album builds until the breathtaking climax of the last song.
Engine Down's vocals are very refreshing and original.
It's one of the most rewarding albums I've come across.
I thought that was a good thing.
I'm kinda offended by the pointless remarks, for why it's a bad album.
I'm sorry if the music is a little too layered and the lyrics take some thought to understand.
Listen to it.
If I could describe the new album as a whole, Id say it's melodic masterpiece.
Even with all the band has been through since the release (the loss of most of their equipment and merchandise in Texas) they still believe in the album.
The album really deserves better reviews than its getting on Amazon.

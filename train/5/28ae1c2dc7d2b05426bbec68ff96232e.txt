I am really happy with the color.I was also able to put this chair together myself in about 30 minutes.
I think it's great.
I'm also happy with how fast it got here.
I wasn't sure what I would do with the toybar after reading the other reviews where people said they don't use it etc, but I like it.
I would definately reccomend this chair!
I don't think the pic online of the mocha does it justice.
My daughter sure did enjoy it also.
Estimated delivery was 6-9 but we received it 6-2!
It will occupy her so that I can finish!
The only assembly problem I had was with the basket.
That's not even a big deal.
I ordered the Mocha color although I really wanted the Orchard, so that it would match my daughter's carrier & stroller.
We will definately use it when she sits at the table with us and she's already finished.
(with the "help" of my 3 & 4 yr olds) My 6 month old seems to really enjoy it.
I just received this chair today and already I am very happy with it.

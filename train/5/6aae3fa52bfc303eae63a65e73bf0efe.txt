If you are wanting to show off and showcase your new system.
Does it compare with Halo?
the story is meh.
You will not have this kind of graphical experience on any current generation hardware.
But the action and the graphics and the gameplay more than make up for the story.Bottom Line: Buy this game with your new XBOX 360.
This game has a great co-op mode to play the whole game in either by split screen or by Xbox Live.
Sometimes you don't even start in the same place on the level.
Wow.
This is the game to do it.
Only Xbox 360 can provide it.
THis is the best.
Absolutely.
The graphics are incredible.
What a great game.
This is no ordinary co-op either.
Kameo is good.
If you need two games, get this one and Kameo.

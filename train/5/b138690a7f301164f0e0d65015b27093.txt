If you know anyone with this speaker set give it a listen.
I listen to classic rock of all kinds 24/7.
These should sound great on any 5.1 system.
I have this set up with a harman/kardon avr 1600 system.
I would recommend this speaker set to anyone and my mom is looking into buying one for her house after hearing them.
I did some research and read my Bose book.
When it comes to speakers.
Don't let the one star people fool you.
If you set these up properly they will blow you away.
For tiny speakers these pump out as much as the 12 inch Cerwins I have as my front channels.
The base is plenty powerful it will shake my windows in a fairly big room.
This is the best system I have heard in the price range.
Just for your info.
You will love it.
Harman/kardon makes amazing systems.
I don't know a whole lot about speakers but I know what sounds good.

You see blood, but a lot is in the distance.
He's cooly psychotic, the type of guy who if you're a deranged person like me you want to meet.
Trust me, despite how good "Pulp Fiction" and "Jackie Brown" were, this is Tarantino's best film.
This movie is awesome.
Steve Buscemi is excellent.
I've seen it about a 1000 times, n ill neva get sick of it.
I can't picture anyone else in that role but Michael Madsen.
Full of classic lines.
In fact the most graphic scene isn't the infamous "ear" scene, but when Mr. Orange is in the car driving to the wearhouse.
Mr.
Pink is also great.
Check it out!
Truly great, and not as encreadibly "graphic" as everyone says.
My favortie "Dog" was Mr. Blonde.
In fact, I can't even start to imagine anyone else in this movie.

It processes photos really slow.
I was still shooting.
It only shoots 1.5 frames a second.
It is heavy, which I like.
Drop it, smack it, treat it like a Nikon, it can handle it.
My sister in law's Cannon Rebel, dead after 7.5 hours.
It only takes CF cards.
This camera is a work horse.
My wife's D3100, dead after 7 hours.
Just yesterday I shot 9+ hours with this camera on one battery!
It's review screen is really small.
It does not have all the bells and whistles of the newer models.
Yes I still shoot film.
I have had my Nikon D70 for just over 4 years now, and yes it is my first digital camera.
So for all the negatives, I still love it.
When I upgrade, I want to keep it as a back up or for someone who wants to get into photography.
The ISO only goes up to 1600.

While my Breadman was being prepared for shipment, I ordered a case of 9-Grain.
Every loaf was perfection - Six of Six.
The next morning with trepidation I ventured forth to make my first loaf of bread, and posted a picture here and for Hodgson Mill 9-Grain Bread Mix.
The way that bread is intended by Mother Nature.
I ordered the Breadman TR-875 the other day when it was a Gold Deal.
A TEXAS-SIZE thank you Breadman.
I read the reviews for the Breadman and discovered the Hodgson Mill, referenced by a Breadman reviewer.
I have never used a bread machine nor made bread.
I cut the heel and had soon eaten almost half the loaf.
:)
They both arrived the same day and I spent the evening discovering the Breadman.
Everything was so simple, with a little research.
Today I just completed making the other five loaves.
I am one proud novice; soon to be considered a professional.
It is fabulous.

I could not plug it into one of my surge protectors, but could plug it into another.
(Perfect for my fiance)
I received this on ONE day!
This alarm clock is awesome.
ALSO I love that you can adjust the brightness!
I saw this had so many good reviews, great price and fast shipping with Prime.
Other than that it's so great!
I plugged it in and bam, there's my time!
Perfect!
It's a SONY and it's $[...].
I searched alarm clock and did bestselling.
You can change the time (if you like to put it fast, like I do).
The radio quality is good, gets better reception than my ipod/radio boombox thing!
Probably just quality control and I got an off one.
I like the size of it, not huge like our last cd-player alarm clock.
Better than getting some piece of junk for over $[...] from Walmart!
I have one complaint, the actual plug prongs seem to be the tiniest bit off.

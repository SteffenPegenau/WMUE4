At first she would run around and I would have to follow her.
So glad I did.
I still have to chase her with it until she gives in.
I pass it over her a couple times a week and there is always so much hair there.
Real happy about no more hair balls.
Heard about this tool on a cat forum.
So exhausting.
I am amazed at how much undercoat hair comes out.
This is her.
She looks better too and her food is starting to make her coat nice and shiny.
She liked it but she was trying not to like it.
She was having trouble with hairballs and I really have not seen one in weeks.
You know, when no means yes.
It's shocking.
But it is a great tool and does exactly what is says it does.
Doesn't compare to her brush.

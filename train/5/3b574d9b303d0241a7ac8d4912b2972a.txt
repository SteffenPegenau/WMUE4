Don't the fans count?
I will never ever watch NBC again and I hope all AW fans do the same.
There are several programs on NBC that I used to watch but they may as well cancel them too because I can not look at the NBC logo without feeling angry and betrayed.
I have been watching ANOTHER WORLD for over 10 years.
When I heard that NBC had cancelled it I was devastated.
HOPEFULLY ANOTHER NETWORK WILL DECIDE TO AIR ANOTHER WORLD.
FANS OF ANOTHER WORLD PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP.
LET'S SAVE AW.
AW is such a wonderful show with incredible actors and great storylines.
Good-bye NBC.
Don't ratings count?
WRITE CBS OR ABC.
When she left I watched sporatically but in the last 2 years I have become hooked again.
I started watching when Anne Heche played Vicky/Marley.
IT'S THE BEST SHOW ON TV AND IT DESERVES 35 MORE YEARS ON TELEVISION
The fact that NBC would cancel AW when there was another soap on NBC with lower ratings makes me furious.

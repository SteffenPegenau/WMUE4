Once this thing latches on to say, a stripped nut, it's not coming off.
This, and the micra, are the most used of my leatherman collection.
The crunch is also good to take on bike rides.
I yanked and yanked but this was on tight.
(read my micra review).
I then moved on to the garage.
It shattered.
Theres nothing wrong with this super tool.
I was amazed when I saw the crunch unfold into extremely effective vice grips, then fold it back up into a tiny ractangle.
I got the crunch because it was different and unique.
A helpful tool to have around the garage, and thats eactly what it is.
When i first got it, I crushed a plastic pen to try it out.
The crunch is like every other leathrerman, except with less tools and a far better set of pliers.
This thing gives so much torque.
It tightens the chain and all of the other hex nuts on it.
Never have I seen anything "crunch" this hard.
I latched its shark jaw onto a stripped nut.

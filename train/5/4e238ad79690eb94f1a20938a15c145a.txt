I really want this released on dvd!
It is worth the time and money!
I have watched this show since i was ten years old.
Lois and Clark talks about many different subjects and is humorous yet romantic.
It shows just how powerful love can be and how important the people you love really are.
Lois and Clark is an amazing show.
Buy it!
I would definitely buy it without any hesitation!
I fell in love with it.
Even if you didn't watch it you should buy it.
I think many people can see part of themselves in different characters and it also shows that communication in very important in any relationship, which all people should know.
It teaches so much and made me beleive very stongly in love.
This was one of the best shows ever and I can't wait till I own the series!
I know many people are waiting for it!
I recommend this show to anyone and hope everyone gets to see it sometime in their life.

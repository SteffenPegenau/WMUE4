Thanks to Dannion for bringing his message to us.
I was in the hospital during the holidays and had just come out of intensivre csre.
I first saw "Saved by the Light" when it was broadcast in 1995.
My hospital stay was difficult.
If you need a lift, or some faith...this one is for you!
I shared my worn out copy, taped off TV, many times and have recently purchased a newer one here in ZShops.
...
I mention this because, as you can see by many of these reviews, this film carries a meaning and purpose.
Peace to You and Be Well!
This film touched me very deeply and was very healing.
Thanks to Eric Roberts for portraying such a dynamic, vivid Dannion!
Each time I saw it, it helped me deal with my situation immensely.
The next time I saw it was two years later, on the eve of another unexpected trip to the hospital!
I hope you can find a copy.
Thanks to everyone who contributed to this excellent, beautiful film.

Because these colors don't run!
Perspective, people!
And if you don't like it you can take your sorry behind out of this country to somewheres that tolerates dissention and improper thought -- like Paris or France.
Clark is about bringing sensibility to this crazy world of ours.
I'm getting all like Captain America -- because I'm weeping tears of freedom!

Wahida Clark is never predictable, I can tell you that.
This book is heavy on allegory and mystical realism, light on heavy-handedness.
Shall we?

It's all about perspective!And if you haven't figured that out by now, well then I weep for you.
For you!

i have other blades too.
Wolborg 2's atack ring is preety strong but my wyborg ripped through it.
When i first launched it in my stadium, it broke my wolborg 2's attack ring!
!
Then, let wyborg get hit and when the shaft changes to attack mode, i call out "Sea wave attack!"
Wolborg 2 draciel s dragoon v2 (japanese blade) driger f trygle master dragoon master dranzer master draciel galman dranzer f dranzer s dragoon fighter and dragoon storm.
Wyborg has this base that switches from endurance to attack when its hit.
I got my blades from a gift card when my uncle put 40 bucks on it for christmas.
Let it rip!!
and my wyborg throws my other blade out of the stadium.
I made up my own attack with wyborg.
Its called "Sea wave attack".
It took me 15 mins.
First launch wyborg in the middle of the stadium.
to build cause of the base.
Thanks to my mom.
Now thats power.
Its like the auto change balancer base.
I bought a Wyborg just yesterday with a marksmangrip.

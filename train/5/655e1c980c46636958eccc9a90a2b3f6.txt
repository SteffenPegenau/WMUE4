I HIGHLY recommend it!
I'd say the quality is on par with Mackie!
!
I cannot believe this was only $45.
I run my guitar in stereo, my keyboard in stereo and the stereo tape input lets me run my PC into it as well, and I STILL have the mic input if I need it!
I don't know how they do it for that price.
This is an awesome unit.
Quality is supreme!
It's 'beefy' and solid in every way.
This is one of the best purchases I've made for my home studio.
Just great!
Well done Behringer!!
I'm sure it has the quality to handle gigs as well with no problem.
The 1/4 inch jacks are rock solid, the metal frame is extremly sturdy and it is dead silent.
Highly recommended!

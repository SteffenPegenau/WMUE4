was it the lack of gore, maybe?
the fact that the zombies dialogue isn't in italics?
no mas.
i read this in three days.
it has more of a supernatural feel than horror, but thats not to say there isn't horrifying things lurking in here.
together with the rising this is an epic story.
i love this book, but i love the rising more.
the rising was a great great book.
i've not read that much EVER!
this book delves deeper into the reasons why zombies exist and all that.
keene is a great writer and knows how to grab hold of your throat.
as soon as i finished the rising i jumped into "city..." once i started the first thing i noticed is that the writing was somewhat different.
i couldn't put it down.
if you didn't like the ending of the rising, you might hate the ending in this one.
anyways, once i got halfway through the book the brian keene from the rising was back.

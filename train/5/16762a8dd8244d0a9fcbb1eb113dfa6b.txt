In most books it's so unreal it makes the book a lower rating.
I always read books and usually find myself saying "no..there's something missing...or...no way seriously?"
I can't say how impressed I am of how well the author wrote this book with such realism it's amazing.
Let me just say OMG!
5 stars Edie Claire!
I wish every book was this good.
This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read in my 25 years!
The way the author describes them fits their roles perfectly through out the book.I laughed, cried,gasped smiled non-stop andeven got the goosebumps at times.
But I give this author much applause for making this book very real.
I can relate.The characters are greatly created.
I recommend this to everyone out there.
There isn't one thing I disliked about this book.
I loved them all.
All the characteristics a great book should entail.
Please give it a chance you won't be disappointed!
Without a doubt it kept my attention from the first page.

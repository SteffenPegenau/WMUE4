I love this show.
is brilliant.
It is an amazing cast and Kyra Sedgewick (Is that her name?)
It's embarrassing how hooked I was.
It is good clean and smart tv.
I am sad and disappointed that "the Closer" is no longer filming.
Every free minute, I watched it.
The stories are awesome and I cried at the last season.
She must have researched for years on this character.
You will love it!
(In all truth, it was way less time than that.
It is nice to see a show you can enjoy for being clever and meaningful without being weirded out or have bad dreams.
She has the Southern way down to an authentic art.
I started on Amazon and watched for a couple months straight through.
I am Southern born and bred and am always picky about Southern accents on television.

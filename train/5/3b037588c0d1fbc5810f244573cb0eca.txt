I have seen water, its water, that's all..." and scattheart.
the lyrics.. are a masterpiece as well.
it is worth it.
while the whole cd does not have the same energy that cvalda has, it gives a pretty rush down my spine.
it had a sugarcubes feel to it, and i got very excited.
selmasongs is not at all what i expected.
hello.
"There is comfort Right in the eye Of the hurricane Just to make it easier on you"
i downloaded cvalda weeks before the cd was released.
"You've never been to Niagara Falls?
selmasongs is the first thing we have seen from bjork since her 1997 lp homogenic was released.
buy the soundtrack, see the movie.
the duet with thom yorke from radiohead is oustanding.
my dearest scatterheart.
three long years, and wow.. was it worth the wait.
the movie makes the soundtrack that much more... emotional.

It has action, adventure, horror(well maybe not horror)comedy and love.
I think that his book, Redwall, beat Harry Potter 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7, and 5,6, and 7 aren't even out yet.
.
I wanted to tell everyone under 13 to read this book.
Matthias, Cornflower, Constance and Basil Stag Hare are my favorite characters.
Then try reading all 14!
.
He kind of has the same attitude like me.
They're funny, entertaining and its easy just to fall right into their world with them as the "stars" of the book.
Mr. Brian Jacques is a magnificent author.
When I read this book for the first time at the end it brought a tear to my eye when.
It's a beautiful story and I urge you to read it.

Hi I'm 14 years old actually but I couldn't use the adult form.

I personaly love Matthias.

Their songs jab at our odd society, most of the time, or use irony and analogy to convey their POV.
No, they haven't stopped punk rocking, they've evolved their lyrics.
Children whose lives suddenly take a wrong turn, like many teens.
And the blending sounds of Noodles and Greg K are great.
They've grown up.
It stabs at the fact that there are more and more gangstas, and some people try too hard to be accepted.
In my opinion, this, the fifth Offspring album, is the best.
The Kids Aren't Alright, for example.
Or, in the case of Feelings and She's Got Issues, still rely on their old ideas, but comes out on top.
The drums are great.
This especially shows on Feelings, Kids Aren't Alright, Walla Walla, Have You Ever.
Think about it.
Pretty Fly For A White Guy.
I still like it, even though it is a little overplayed.
If the sixth CD got any better than this, it would be perfection.

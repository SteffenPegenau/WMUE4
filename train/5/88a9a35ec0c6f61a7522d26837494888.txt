When you play a movie that's in .avi format (which is only 1 file) of course it's going to return you to the menu.
I have had this player for about 16 months now.
The disk skipping straight to the menu when you press next chapter only happens on divx files.
I have only had 1 out of hundreds of DIVX movies not work.
You can set it up to play both.
As far as some other complaints that I have read here, some of them are not founded.
Either way, if it fails for this after 16 months of use, then so be it.
It doesn't matter if it's PAL or NTSC.
The blue video with component outputs can be fixed by following the setup instructions properly.
Quality is definitely better if you use component cables vice direct rca connections.
The blinking red light and NoCD problems I haven't experience yet.
But, it's still a fine player for daily use.
There isn't another chapter to go to.
I'll just go spend the $50 and buy another one.
This thing plays everything.

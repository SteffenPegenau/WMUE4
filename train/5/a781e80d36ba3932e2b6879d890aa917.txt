I am 100% satisified with this purchase!
As far as being able to put it in with one hand goes I haven't had to do that.
It's great that her teethers & toys don't hit the floor.
She goes from carseat to cart.
My baby is 8 months old.
It has fit every cart that I've put it in; Walmart, Winn Dixie, & even Good Will.
I bring the cart to my vehicle & put the cover in it there instead of trying to hold a baby while getting the cart ready.
I reviewed all the shopping cart covers online before purchasiing one.
I highly recommend this shopping cart cover.
Second, a review stated it's made in the USA.
The color & texture is nice.
This was my choice for 2 reasons.
The material is nice.
This cover is beautiful!
First, the cushions on the sides of the baby.

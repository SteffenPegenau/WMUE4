It's all leather with no nylon liners or anything.
One day!
Plenty of pockets on it to put cells phones etc.
I like the way it looks on my bike.
I ordered it Columbus Day and had it Tuesday after work.
I won't hesitate to use Jafrum in the future.
That means it will fit around just about any sissy bar.
Trust me, I'm a real person with no association to Jafrum or Amazon (except as a customer).
Two bottom Velcro straps wrap around your sissy bar.
and the inside is roomier than the dimensions listed would leave you to believe.
I have a Honda VTX 1300 with a stock sissy bar on the back and it seems good and tight to me.
Oh, by the way, doing business with Amazon and Jafrum was a pleasure.
This is a good quality bag!
Wow!
I've owned it just a week or so but my initial impression is to recommend you to buy it.
Reading the first review, I was unsure if it was real or not.

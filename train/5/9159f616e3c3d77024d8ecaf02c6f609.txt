Remember it, and follow it through to summation.
I highly reccomend this book.
Havent you ever read a stephen king before?
In fact, read all 7.
Now, i admit, at first i was dissapointed.
It was amazing.
If you like King, or just good writing, read this one.
I have to ask myself, however, what did you expect?
But as Mr King pointed out, its the journey.
Read the book, then set back and digest all of the series.
He doesnt give a happy ending, he gives the RIGHT ending.
I see alot of negative feedback from people who have read the book.
Think about it.
Cmon.
A happy ending, all of them taking the tower and righitng the wrong, and living happily ever after?

The music was not bad, nothing more.
But... nothing more.
Since then I listen every day.
I saw Buddy Guy some years ago at Peer, the biggest blues festival in Belgium.
Good music, good drive, real blues.
Is this the Buddy Guy i knew?
It wasn't bad but it was showbusiness.
A 12 minute song... and not a second too long.
Long time I heard some music moving me so deep.
I heard Sweet Tea at the CD shop and... WAW!
It's another one.
The one who has the blues in every vein.
I couldn't appreciate his (good) imitations of all the famous guitar players.
I bought 'Slippin' in' and I liked it.
No!
Wicked of Shemekia some months ago and now Sweet Tea... this is really a great blues year!
The one who isn't afraid of some risks.
This goes to the inside of your brain and hits you in your stomach.
This is real!

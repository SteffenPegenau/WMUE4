I love the touchpade controls.
It's so small.
It looks sleek and modern.
It's faster than WMP.
If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player.
I absolutely love it.
I got my Zen Micro last week.
It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course.
The battery has a long life.
They're easy to use.The radio and voice recording are nice.
So far I have no complaints with this player.
The sound is amazing.
The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use.
The menu is easy to use and understand.
The earbud headphones are really nice.
It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.
It holds plenty of songs.

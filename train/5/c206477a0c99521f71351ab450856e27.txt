It was not runny just personally i like my eggs fully cooked to a scrambled consistancy.
you should eat breakfast every morning.
if it is a medium egg use the directions.
Little advice.
Your breaking the 8hour + fast....Cheers...
Think about the cost savings.
it is the most important meal of the day.
if it is a large-xlarge egg, use a little more water.
We will not be going to McDonalds ever again.
This is my first impression.
Im sure you will save more than 30 bucks if your a avid breakfast eater.
that is why they call it Break Fast.
If i have issues in the future, I will buy anoother one.
This thing is great.
30 bucks for a great machine like this is worth buying once a year.

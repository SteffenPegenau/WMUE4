The reviews for the Cuisinart were very good from experts and people who own one.
We needed to replace our Kitchen Aide mixer.
It is a bit pricey, but will last for the rest of our lifetimes.
It is a nice steel gray color and looks great on my countertop.
The best kind of gift, something that will be used often.Cuisinart SM-70BC 7-Quart 12-Speed Stand Mixer, Brushed Chrome
It was packaged very securely and arrived several days after purchase.
This was a Christmas gift that will be used weekly.
We found a jewel with our Cuisinart.
We researched mixers before purchasing this one.
It was easy to clean up after I was done using it.
We love it!
It mixes and kneads well.
We will get years of good use from this sturdy mixer.
The shield really protects the area and attaches to the top so it lifts out of place when the head is lifted.
My husband and I both do a lot of baking so a good mixer was essential.
I love the timer feature on it and the beginning slow speed to start mixing.

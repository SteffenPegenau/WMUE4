It means pen.
I would recommend the book the people.
Does he make it or does he fail.I loved the book because it had so many adventures and he did it.
He his teacher likes it and enters it in the dictionary.
Nick comes up with a new word it is called frindle.
If she sees you with gum she will tape it an index card and ware it for the day and have it signed and then brought back to school.
She says everyone should have it.
I hope I inspired people and kids like me to get out there and read.
And the town it called the home of the frindle.
She loves the dictionary it takes 2 of the strongest men in the class to carry it.
Soon his school says it.
FrindleBy Andrew ClementsThe book Frindle by Andrew Clements is about a boy named nick who is a big troublemaker and in fourth grade.
I would say the age from where you could read it is 9-12.
Nick gets detention all most every day because he calls the pen frindle.
When he gets into fifth grade it's a new ballgame.

But then there will be more greatness.
His early work is remakable, this is stupendous.
This though, is a great artist with a great album.
This is the start of the Tom Petty that is still incredible today and has not stopped.
This album is a mature and insightful Tom Petty that has been longing.
Start here and keep going.
"Echo" is a great place to end.
Nothing too different, but different.
It's almost like every song deserves it's own spin-off album.
I bought this album knowing Tom Petty was doing some different things.
It's perfect.
Like U2's "Joshua Tree" or, even more appropriate, "Actung Baby", "Wildflowers" is pure greatness from the first note to the last.
Seriously, get in the car, drive on a great stretch of road and let yourself get lost in "Wildflowers".
Okay, yeah, there are great artists with great songs out there.
Each and every song has it's own feeling, but not one too far from the other.

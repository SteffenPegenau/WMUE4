How it was done & just the dark humor in it was what amazed me the most about it.
Wow what a movie!
Fargo is a strange movie but is extremely interesting.
Everyone in this movie was great & the twisted plot made it so outstanding.
The humor is very dark but somewhat understandable why it's funny.
I can go on forever about this movie.
After seeing this movie, Steve Buscemi became 1 of my favorite actors!
It makes my top 10 list, easy.
I already thought he was cool but this movie just made him even cooler.
William H. Macy is great too.
I loved the creative performance of Francis McDormand as the pregnant police lady!
She was brilliant & was just there!
He's brialliant!
I loved all the actors!
The part was hers.

I own my own contracting company and use this gun in the field.
Great line of sight for intricate wood work.
Only down fall is the loading mechanism.
Great for driving multiple nails quickly.
If you load 3 clips of nails, the last clip has be pulled down past the lock.
Its lightweight and also has a bump trigger.
It has a tool belt clip so you place it at easy acess when putting up trim.
Several great things about the DeWalt.
It also has a multi positon exhuast head, so no more dust in the face.3.
I must say, it is a great gun.

I previously have used Porter Cable and that was a great product also.
In time it may slide easier with a little wear, but brand new, its a little tight on the clips.

First thing I did after assembly was to look at the moon.
I also purchased the 13% moon filter, a 2X Barlow, and an additional 6.3mm plossl eyepiece.
Like was said elsewhere, they are really in two different camps.
The tripod is quite sturdy.
Great crisp image.
:)
The last item brings the magnification up to about 206X.
It came well packaged and rather quickly.
For an equatorial mount 130mm reflector, this one is hard to beat.
(260x is the highest useable magnification, 16x being the lowest.)
All in all, I'm very pleased with this telescope.
Thanks Orion!
The rather negative review that compares a Dobsonian to this telescope isn't a fair one.
Keep upp the good work!
I appreciate "KDKNS"'s review; it's got a lot of good tips.
Orion makes quality optics for reasonable prices.
My first word was "WOW!"

And quite witty and sarcastic.
It's the everyday man that suffers the most.

Look what is happening right now!!!
Also, written in the early 50's, one can see nothing much has changed in society.

I love the wise cracks sprinkled throughout the book.
This book is excellent.
Raymond Chandler is the king of gritty crime novels.
Almost lyrical.
That you can find out for yourself.

His writing is wonderful.
What else is new??
I could not put the book down and read it in 2 days!

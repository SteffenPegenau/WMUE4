This is not to say that Rudresh has not studied the masters -- he clearly has.
His sound is huge and confident.
But Rudi's sound is all is own.
His technique is burning.
This is not the sort of album where a young lion tries to convince you that they are well versed in all the various styles, and the history, of jazz.
Rather, this album is created from a singular voice and vision.
His ideas are endless.
Definitely burning.
But someone had to review this great disc.Check it out.
His tunes are indsidiously infective.
Or if Tony Williams played saxaphone, he'd probably sound a lot like Rudi.Burning.
He is compared to Ornette and to Coltrane and to Steve Coleman and to Bird, but I don't think he sounds like any of those guys.
He sounds like Alan Holdsworth on saxophone.
And check out ......END
And I'm not just saying that because he's my friend.

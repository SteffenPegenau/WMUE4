That's supposed to build character, and make him become a good boy.
He goes to a camp for bad kids and has to dig holes every day.
Near the end of the book one of Stanley's friends gets bit by a highly venomous yellow spotted lizard.
I'm from Gettysburg Area Middle School.
I highly recommend this book to anybody.
Stanley saves him and gets to go home from the camp.

Read this book and you'll agree.
It's about a boy named Stanley Yelnats.
He makes a lot of friends with weird with weird nicknames.
He's an overweight boy that always gets in trouble.
I want to tell you a little bit about the book, Holes.

You might [get] a fire power.
Kiby is back and tons more fun.
I beat the game in 1 week.
But then I found 2 things that kept me playing for months.
Kirby can do many cool attacks.
2.
Then you spit it out on a enemy that has a cutter power.
1.
The dark matter wants the crystal.
You get a fire sword.
( Ther are 7 different powers. )
There are so many different powers.
There are three different mini games that you can play with 4 people.
At first this game is easy.
This is how.
This game is great for Kirby fans.
You must go to all 6 worlds to get them back.
This thing called Dark Matter.

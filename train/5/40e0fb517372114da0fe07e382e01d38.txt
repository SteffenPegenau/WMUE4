I did not have anything go wrong with them though.
I recommend this computer.
It works good.
I sometimes use emacs when I play around with computer programing.
I used them in the universities too.
It has a big screen and good speakers and a good music system with itunes.
I had good experiences with the eMac.They are heavy though so it is a desktop computer not easy to move around.
I am completely happy with my eMac.
It is plenty for every thing I do.
I have not had to buy much software; but I am thinking about buying Quicken software.
I usually have mutliple browsers open too.I use DSL with my eMac and it is fast.
It is an excellent computer.
My eMac has been problem free and is delightful to use.I have had another eMac before; but I gave it to my Mom and I bought another one.I have friends with them too.
I bought my eMac computers new; but I bought them with the insurance with apple incase anything went wrong.
I have a Gigga bite of memory chip in it.

This is the magic of Napoleon Dynamite.
Either you get it or you don't.
I thought it was funny and fun to watch.
I thought almost every scene was funny.
Its deadpan delivery masks layers of emotions.
The movie happens inside of you not on the screen.
My wife was bored and kept commenting on how slow it was.
I get it.
I just saw this movie on DVD last night I laughed hard.
On one level or another we are all like Napoleon.
And besides the time machine scene made me laugh so hard it "killed."
This is what this movie meant to me.
And although we are not as imobilized or socially retarded like him, we all have had our awkward moments, and our moments of triumph.
My wife did not.
And like Napoleon, if we have his integrity, we come through it all with our PRIDE INTACT.
My wife thought it was "mean."
It has many layers of meaning.

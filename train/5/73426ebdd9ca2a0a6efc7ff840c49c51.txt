"Twilight of the Gods" is just boring.
"Boot Camp" is so stupid that you'll skip past it halfway through.
Some of these films are so bad you just laugh.
You're laughing at them.
And you're not laughing with them.
If this is "The Best Of Boys In Love" I'd really hate to see the worst of boys in love.
"Death In Venice, CA" is very good.
The rest of the films are trash.
It's a beautiful love story about a young 17 year old and an older man.
"SPF 2000" is about an alien that comes to earth to put suntan lotion on people's bodies.
It's funny for about 2 seconds.
It's the only reason why I'm giving this DVD 5 stars.
Then it's time to turn it off.
"Achilles" is ok. "Karen Black Like Me" is like a Saturday Night Live skit.
It's pretty funny.
It's a musical set up in a gay bar.
Weird.
It's about a monster dildo that attacks a queen.
"Dirty Baby Does Fire Island" is about a perverted baby doll that comes to life and enjoys watching men having sex.

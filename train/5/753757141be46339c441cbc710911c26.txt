It is the perfect size to carry around day to day.
It comes with a vinyl zipper bag for "wet" stuff.
It also has a large outer velcro pocket.
I've also washed it in the washing machine and air dried it and it still looks brand new after using it almost every day for two years!
It is sooooo comfortable to carry and I love the way the zipper zips and unzips.
I've had this diaper bag for about two years now and have absolutely loved it!!!
It is extremely durable!
It has a zipper pocket and six mesh compartments.
The inside compartment is extremely orginized which I love!
Overall, it's the best diaper bag I've ever owned and I have 4 children and am expecting my fifth.
Plus, I love the color and my husband isn't embarassed at all to carry it around.
I love the outer pocket for "mommy's stuff" like wallet, pen, lipgloss, and keys.
It has an insulated cup holder on one side and a mesh holder on the other.
It comes with a changing pad.
You can do it with just one hand.

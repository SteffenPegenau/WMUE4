It is amazing!
It comes with batteries.
So why the [modest] price tag (IT seems so cheap)!
It is soooo great and I am very happy with it.
It has MP3 playback, VCD, HDCD, DVD, you know the rest, yet it is sooo CHEAP!
It is great, and soo cheap.
Well simply, because it is a no name brand that doesnt need to advertise or put their DVD player on magazine covers with silver special effects.
Everyone who doesnt want to spend a lot on a REALLY TOP OF THE LINE dvd player, with progressive scan and the works, GET THIS ONE.
It works excellent.
Its instruction book is so easy to understand.
It doesnt skip.
It has all the features (besides Progressive Scan) that [many of the more expensive] DVD players have.
To start, this DVD player seems a mystery to me.
It doesnt overheat DVDs.
And it comes with all the cables.
It is possibly the best DVD player you can buy.

I highly recommend this product!!!
Not only do I have crystal clear calls but the range is awesome!!!
I don't have home phone service, but it feels like I do now.
(Both on sale!!)
The phone rings normally and I can use all the features the cordless phone has including caller ID.
!
It dials out just fine just make sure you read the instructions on setting it up!!.
WOW!!
And that is much less than a dedicated wifi phone!!
I bought this product and connected it to a 5.8GHZ cordless phone...
I have always had problems with skype and the corded USB phone that I have.
I have an older laptop doing the job!!
MY only regret is not buying this sooner.
The cost of this adapter and the cordless phone came out to less than $30.
It needs to be plugged into a PC that is always on... but that's ok.

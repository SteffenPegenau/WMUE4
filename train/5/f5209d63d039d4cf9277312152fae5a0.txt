This thermos is a savior.
Really hot.
I'll brew coffee in the morning and by the time I'm leaving work, my coffee is still to hot to drink right away.But what's even better about this thermos is how cold it can keep ice water.
Amazing.I'm pretty sure this thermos has vortex to another realm where liquids don't change temperature.
Here in Arizona, as some of you may know, it gets hot.
I forgot about it under my bed and found it couple days later.
No joke: in 48 hours, only half the ice had melted.
During the summer months here, you need to drink a lot more water than normal.
This product is well worth the small price tag.
110-115 deg.
f. hot.
Hot liquids will stay burn-your-mouth hot for about 8 hours.
My goodness.
This week, I filled the chamber with ice and then poured water in.
I bought this during Arizona's "winter months" to use for tea and coffee.

This leash will probably be the last leash I ever have to buy my dog.
It is almost like she is off the leash.
I owned one of these before & it lasted 3 years.
The 5 stars is well deserved & I would have given it more, if possible.
I believe she won't ever need another one.
I also use it on my other little dogs.
She is a black lab & is 8 years old.
She gets to move around & gives me a lot of control over her.
It is larger & longer.
Once you feel the weight of the leash.
You can feel how strong it is & I love how the leash retracts so fasts & the locking mechanism.
Plus I it gives her so much room to go go anywhere.
I absolutely love this leash.
The one I have now is much more durable then the last one I bought.
I can't see how anyone has anything bad to say about this leash.

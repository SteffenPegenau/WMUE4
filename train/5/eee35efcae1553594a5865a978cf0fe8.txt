But it's all in fun and it's fun to watch.
It was about the 3 boys and their quest for adventure without adults telling them what to do.
I thought they were fantastic.
But that's what made the movie good.
I can't remember when I've had so much fun watching a movie.
They just wanted to have fun.
I mean, after all, what's a kid's movie without a few screams?
I recommend it for children (especially boys) as well as for adults.
So watch it and be energized.
This movie is not hard to find.
The 3 leads were almost always out front.
Some reviews have complained about too much screaming in this movie.
I bought the DVD on-line.
The 3 boys who play the leading roles did such a remarkable job.
This movie is about 3 young boys who have just gotten out of school for the summer and can't think of anything to do.
So, they proceed to get into various types of mischief.
The supporting cast in the movie stayed mostly in the background.
I don't agree.

This game's easily the most intense 2D Contra game available.
Play the first level and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.
Four characters to choose from!
Trust me.
Multiple endings!
You'll thank me later.
And the 2-player mode is the greatest!
Why's that?
Huge explosions and enormous bosses really push the power of the Sega Genesis to its limit.
Not that the 2-player mode's gonna help you get any further, but it's still really cool to play cooperatively with a friend.
Think again!
Think you're good at Contra games?
While it's fast-paced action throughout, don't go thinking that you're gonna beat this game in one sitting.
Four unique weapons per character!
Just play it.

I always thought Labor Days was Aesop Rocks' weakest effort though...
I guess good music scares most people.Standout tracks: all of them, these are just really good.03.

I also think Float, Appleseed are better albums than Labor Days (Music for Earthworms is pretty good too)... Bazooka Tooth is a way DIFFERENT, which is good, ... with production mostly from Aesop himself, it is interesting tenfold... this is where Hip-Hop should be... Who ever said Hip-Hop is dead is stupid...

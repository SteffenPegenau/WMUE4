And outlaw Outkast, Lupe, Mos Def, Common, and Talib while your at it!How dare an accomplished rapper try to break the mold of what popular rap can be and make uplifting songs like Beach Chair!!
Trash Jay when he gets thoughtful!
Bump some thoughtful music like "Na Na NaNa Na" or "Air Force Ones"!
YES!
Don't buy anything unless it's GANSTA!
But then again I'm white.
"Oh, this aint like his old stuff".
What do I know about sarcasm?Make it rain!!
Then they can all be like Curtis and say how much they love smokin' and drinkin' when they don't even do it!
Great idea!!
Or just bump 808s and Heartbreak and try not to feel like a retard....
So they're supposed to all rap about the same things regardless of the life they live at the time right?
Really?
That way they can keep the hip hop culture in the NWA days and never move the culture on to anything else!
Keep it real like Game's back and forth bi-polar self!

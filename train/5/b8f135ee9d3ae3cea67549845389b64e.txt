WOW WOW WOW WOW!
HE DESERVED TO WIN THE OSCAR!
I FOUND IT TO BE VERY POWERFUL AND IT MADE ME TEAR-UP A LITTLE AT THE END!!
AND SO DID ANNETTE!
IT WAS A SUPERB FILM WITH FANTASTIC THEMATIC ELEMENTS THAT MADE IT STAND OUT ABOVE THE REST OF THE NOMINEES AT THE OSCARS!!
SHE WAS GREAT AND I FELT FOR HER AS HER HUSBAND WAS FANTACISING ABOUT AN 18 YEAR OLD GIRL!
I LOVED THIS FILM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
COULD THERE BE A GREATER DRAMA THAN THIS?!
I LOVED IT!

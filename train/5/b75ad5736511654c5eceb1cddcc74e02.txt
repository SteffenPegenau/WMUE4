The movie was mainly about football team.
This is what made the team so good.
In this country their was a school that had to be torn down and the black kids that went to this school had to move to another school that had only whites.
The team won the championship game and the boy that got in the car accident died like five or ten years later.
They were also undefeated.
How Denzel Washington was so hard on the team.
They had to learn how to get alone with each others.
They had the best football team.
They were very good.
One of the boys on the team got in a car accident and he was paralized from the waist down.
I really love it.In this movie it talked about a racism country.
This was the only school that had a mixture of whites and blacks.
He didn't get to play in the championship game so the team won specificatly for him.
This movie is so good.
The more the team won the games the more the parents started to get alone with each other.

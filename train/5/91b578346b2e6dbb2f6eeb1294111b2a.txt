A favorite bedtime story for both kids (now 4 and 2).
Wheels go click.
Gently toss this way and that.
Clickety-Clack!"
Fantastic book!
Large pages (hardback book is 9x11 inches) with bright and colorful illustrations.
The rhyme and flow of the words is soothing and easy to read.
It's very entertaining even as an adult to see what each character is doing as the story progresses.

Wheels go clack.
Glide across a plain so flat.
A sample page: "Cars sway on the wooden track.
There is SO MUCH to see on each page.
Clickety-Clack!
We bought this because my then-2 year old son loved trains, but our daughter is now that age and she loves the story just as much, even without a train fascination.

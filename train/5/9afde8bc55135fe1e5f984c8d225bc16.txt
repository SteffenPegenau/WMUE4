In this economy I dont have alot of money to spend on this.
I have my desktop with a new Belkin N router and on the other side of my home we have a home office.
Everything I researched was so expensive.
I have windows vista and XP and it worked on both.
Give it a try as you have nothing to lose.
I even called Cablevision to get a second Modem and they wanted $50 a month.
My signal went from "very low" to "Excellent" within minutes.
I have a large home about 5000 sq.
I did not have to use the enclosed hardware ,luckily, as there is none in a netbook.
Our netbook was getting a "very low" signal.
ft.
This was so affordable for $30.00.
I am glad I did.
A repeater would cost a few hundred dollars.
I hooked this up and it immediately installed.

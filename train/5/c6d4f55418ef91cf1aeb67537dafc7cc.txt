I thought to myself.. there must be a reason it's on sale.
If you are the slightest fan of his, make sure you pick this up and add it to your collection.
I saw this video on sale at a local store before it was available on Amazon.com...
If anything he's gotten better with age.
Why so cheap!?
The man is SMMMMoooooooth!
Watch how he handles the jealous boyfriend in the audience.
He's really incredible...
I'm sure you won't regret it.
I still enjoy putting it on as I work around the house and find I sit down and watch certain cuts over and over again.
I only regret not buying it sooner!
And he does it without making anybody angry.
It not only shows smokey being personal with the audience, but you get a sense of the man behind the great song library.
After purchasing it and watching it numerous times, I still cannot answer that question.
This is a fabulous DVD.
(Did you know he wrote ALL those songs?)

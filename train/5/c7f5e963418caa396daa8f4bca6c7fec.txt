Tracing or projecting is frowned upon so she begins by explaining her dot to dot method of drawing.
Of all the hundreds of art books I have, this is my favorite.
.
This is a no-nonsense, informative reference for painters of all levels.
After reading her book, I discovered that Mrs. Weaver teaches not only in Florida, but around the country and around the world.
She ends the book with many step by step demos.
Mrs. Weaver is a direct painter who chooses a limited palette and her paintings are bold, strong, and colorful.
Her delightful personality is reflected in this book.
Pat Weaver has a delightful painting style and is an extraordinary teacher.
She then goes into color theory and picking a palette.
.
She is not one to condone the "tricks" of watercolor.
and possible.
She believes that learning to draw is essential .
I have been fortunate enough to have taken some of her watercolor workshops.

Salinger has really hit the nail on the head with this timeless classic.
I couldn't put the book down.
She was right.
He finds faults in almost everyone he talks about.If they aren't Phony they are boring.
Recently, my wife recommened the book to me.
At one point, you realize that he's just as phony as everyone else.There are points where you feel for Holden and other times you hate him.
The book follows Holden on a three day journey through New York.
He shares his cynical and often negitive views on life,family and "so-called" friends.
It is one of the best novels I've read in a long time.
obviously there hardly is one.
Salinger's masterpiece follows the misadventures of 16 year old Holden Caulfield.
What makes this book work is it's study of the human condition.
The brilliance of the book is not the plot.
" The Catcher in the Rye' wasn't a book that I had the chance to read in high school.
She said it would be something I would really enjoy.
But it doesn't matter.

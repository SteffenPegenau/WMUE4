I love it.
Xmas came and so did my gift.
Well stiched, no defects.
This clip won't be coming off any time soon.
Comes out smoothly.
The leather is lined with a flannel material.
It swivels, with stops vertical and horizontal, which is very important.
The belt clip is solid, backed up and stiched in.
No feeling whatsoever of losing it or it popping out or slipping off no matter what.
You can insert phone into case in any direction, face in, out, up, down.
It feels good in the hand and even elegant.
Acess to all buttons, speakers, jacks.
This is a VERY well made product.
The iphone fits its case snuggly.
It slides in to the holster firmly.

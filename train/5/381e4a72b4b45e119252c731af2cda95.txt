I paid a dear price for mine, but it was worth, adding to my collection of rare and very special music!
This deserves nothing less than 5 stars!
SOS Band, I don't want nobody else,nobody but you!!
I promise.
If anyone with this album has ignored this song, please pay attention.
My favourite song in the entire album.
that is one of their best songs, and it quickly earned my respect.
Those Guys can sing, Jason Bryant can sing!
You will love it.
Unfortunately, this Album, particularly on CD is almost impossible to come by.
Get it if you can!
I did not pay much attention to the other songs, but suddenly realised, that I also liked the song "Just The Way You Like It", and especially how the ending led into the beginning of "Weekend Girl".
!
I remember, i would come from school, and the first thing I would do was play "Weekend Girl".
This was my first SOS Album to come across.
Soon the other songs were favourable, and mostly "I Don't Want Nobody Else".

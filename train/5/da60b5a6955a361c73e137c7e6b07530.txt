no one would buy sex from a pube ridden hooker.
before reading this book my clothes were riddled with pubes and peppered with semen.
i found it amongst old condoms and other useless things.
i began to develop rashes and callused scaly skin.
my.
cotton shirts that i once loved felt like wool to my sensitive skin.
not only was by apartment a mess of pube harassed shirts but my skin was beginning to resemble scales.
life.
but then, one day i had my awakening.
i was pathetic.
my clothes would just sit in the corner of my room - abandoned I left them in this horrifying, tangled, sticky, mass of has-been t-shirts and seer sucker shorts.
betty, girl, this book has changed.
i found myself lost - wondering aimlessly through the city streets.
i couldn't look at myself in the mirror.
i turned to drugs and prostitution to try to get the pubes draped upon my body off my mind, but no.
i am human again.
now, i don't look like an animal when i put on a t-shirt.

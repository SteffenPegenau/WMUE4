blending , grating, etc.. .
It's so powerful; for a reasonable price as well.
I dare any food processor to do what this can do.
I have done so many things with this.
I would recommend this to all over alot of the other processors.
The storage unit is nice for those four blades that you use in the dial .
You don't have to leave it out hanging like you do on alotta things.
You can put the spindle and dough blade in there too.
It's just a wonderful food prep center.
such as the thick slice blade thin slice.
I have ground beef in this, and less fat as well.
A great feature is the cord storage thing.
I have used this to slice cucumbers.
Saves alot of time in slicing .
etc.
IT has saved me money as well.

And what about that cute song mom and kids sing?
At first I thought it was the stupidist thing I'd ever seen.
Jane Powell sings beautifully.
Oh, and get this; urban, divorced, career mom, dresses well, has three cute kids, and gets a nice man!
And wait!
If you didn't get it, watch it again!
Even the housekeeper has it.
This is 1948!
A family!
Speaking of which, the music is great.
How great is that?
The DOCTOR says to the kids (of single mom), "It's difficult to raise children right, and your mother had done it right."
Later, believe it or not, there's a harmonica concerto.
Now I love it.
They all have it.
There's more!
Also, get this, for an immediately post-war movie -- they don't finish by moving OUT of the city -- they stay in it!
There is even the odd little twist that the nice man, though sexy, I guess, for his time, is SHORTER than the lovely Irene Dunne, but it's not a big deal!
This movie is odd but wonderful.
Then I watched it again.

Also, it is a high quality device.
This is because it does not require you to use their software and drivers.
This device is a very good non-professional capture device.
The quality hardware is the reason this device is so expensive.
If you do, you will end up throwing the cheap one away.
I use cyberlink Power Director.
THIS ONLY APPLIES IF YOU HAVE A 6 PIN FIREWIRE (1394) PORT ON YOUR COMPUTER.
If you have a 4 pin firewire port, you will need a 4 pin to 6 pin cable.
It seems a bit pricey but it is definately worth it.
All operating systems have some kind of capture software bundled with them.
Three cheers for Canopus!!
There are several reasons to like it.
It is compatable with whatever operating system you have.
Another reason to like it is you do not need a external power device.
The cheap ones rarely work right.
Don't waste any money with cheaper devices.
If you have no port firewire port whatsoever, you cannot use this device.
None are included, but don't worry.

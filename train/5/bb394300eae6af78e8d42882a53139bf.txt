Its ashame that this cd has great song except one.
But thats just that ONE song.Now we get to the worthy part.
It a top notch cd with the exception for the first song Hexagram.
Common Chino what were you doing when you wrote that!!
I want to give this cd 4 and a 1/2 stars.
This is a great cd!
I recomend this cd along with evrey other deftones release.
By far the worst song on the album.
Also this song will hurt your ears, not in a good way, the music does not go together.
I mean I cannot stand Hexagram.
The beginning starts of very disturbing and meaningless.
This is a good cd with lots of extras like pictures and stuff.
What the hell is that song about???
!
The last six songs on the album are killer!
Album ends great (last six).
Apart for Hexagram the whole song list is absoutly amazing.
But since i cant ill give it 5.
Evreysong is a keeper.
Its just Chino yelling like a nut.

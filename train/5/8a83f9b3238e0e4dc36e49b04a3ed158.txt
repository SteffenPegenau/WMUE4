My pain on a scale of 1-10 was a 10.
I researched the net to try to find an explaination of why this was happening and what I could do.
I now have the knowledge of what lies beneath this pain that is 100% real.
A colleage shared the idea of this book with me.
I went to the chiropractor and had the electrodes, massage therapy, adjustments, acupuncture nothing helped.
Dr Sarno I thank you for relieving me of my excrutiating pain and allowing me to return to a normal life.
I came down with a bad bout of sciatica last fall of 2007.
The self talk explained in the book was what really worked for me.
I was in excrutiating pain.
I went to the PC DR and was prescribed steriods and an MRI.
I tried everything.
Pain started in my buttocks and radiated down to my knee cap.
My pain subsided in a matter of weeks.
I went home watched the DVD and then read the book.
I could not sit, lay down, or sleep.
The MRI showed a slipped disk on my left side note my pain was on the right.

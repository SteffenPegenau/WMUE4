I first read this book when I was a teenager .
yes, they had sex in the 1950's!
And yet, the themes in this book are enduring .
I am so thrilled to be able to access it again now that it is back in print.
.
I loved it then and I still love it now.The Cheerleader is an honest portrayal of high school life in the 1950's including school dances, first romances, coursework pressures, and sex .
Much of the book's charm is how accurately it captures the essence of the 50's with the sock hops, soda bars, and letterman sweaters.
as so many high school activities tend to be.
.
.
many moons ago.
.
friendships, loyalties, first loves, and remaining true to one's self.Many of the book's events are superficial on the surface .
.
But underlying high school drama are important lessons to be learned.I look forward to sharing this classic book with my own daughters.

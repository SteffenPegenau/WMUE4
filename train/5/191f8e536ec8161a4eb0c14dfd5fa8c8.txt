It is no doubt a game that has its disturbing moments.
The storyline was well told and laid out.
I don't think I haven't flinched this much playing a game since Manhunt 1!
I also liked the hint system when you were stumped on what to do or where to go next.
The style of the game was very creepy and unique.
The levels were beautiful and eerie at the same time.
The atmosphere was unlike any game I have played.
I guess you have to be intrigued by this sort of game to consider it great.
I think I will give Bioshock 2 a shot!
I have heard of all the other great series on Xbox, but this one slipped by me.
There was a variety of ways to defeat your enemies.
This was a trippy game through and through.
I really appreciated all the save points in this game.
Being able to upgrade weapons and plasmids made for interesting battles.
Some enemies will come out of nowhere because they are blended so well in the detailed yet twisted scenery.

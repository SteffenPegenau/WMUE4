A heart for orphans and widows.
It's obvious what need to happen.
A heart for my wife and sons.
This book has shown me how to pursue God, show others to pursue Him and to never settle for man's tradition over The Manifested Jesus Christ.
Look at all the other reviews.
This facts and history in this book shook every thing to pieces in my faith except the thing that holds all things together...My Foundation...
Thanks Frank.
Th Living Christ needs His rightful place in our midst.
Why do so many local bodies of believers look crippled spiritually?
His complete headship.
Look at the book.
The Risen Christ!
A new believer as of 2000 I am.
They are not crippled, they just think we are a small business and those concepts will apply to us.
So many people have so many gifts and we accept the way we do it on Sunday and it has no New Testament basis.
Look at God's word!
A heart for The Living God.
Christ The Revolutionary wants His bride to himself.

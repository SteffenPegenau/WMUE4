Great content.
On a skating scale I give it a 9.9 !!!
(.01 deduction for not having a photo of G&G on the front or back covers.)
:o) LOL!
Great photos.
The photos are fabulous!
There also is a whole chapter on Scott...the "Father" of the show.
This book was not very expensive in my opinion.
Around $20.00, and WELL worth it.
!
Great read.
Hienz Kluetmeir is a genius with the camera, and many of his famous shots are in the book.
It is a VERY good behind-the-scenes look at how this incredible show got started, how it is put together, how difficult the training, and organization is, and how close all of the skaters and crew are.
There is a WHOLE entire chapter devoted to Gordeeva and Grinkov, and many photos of them, as well as Katia solo, and some of Dasha too.
It really IS a big family.

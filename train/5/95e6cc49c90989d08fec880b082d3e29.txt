It is soo sad, but the message(s) it's trying to get across are very well made clear.
My description isn't as long or deep as everybody else's, but here it is.
!
It has wonderful music.
If you want to see a good movie that's really worth seeing, then watch Dancer in the Dark.
Bjork is the best!
Watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well produced, unbelievably well acted.
I can understand not liking how it is depressing, but anybody would have to admit that it is a very very very good movie.
This movie is so inspiring.
People were crying from the very beginning of the movie.
Watch it if you are ready to think you will die crying.
Her music is so touching.
I think for somebody to not like it, they have to be crazy.
When she sings "I've Seen it All" I could feel the whole movie audience lapse into sadness.

Please get this CD and th first one as well!
they don't write their songs!
They have fabulous songs!
That's a GOOD thing.
Whoever said that their Nsync w/ guitars- do you really think Nsync could write such great songs as Emotionless or Moving On- oh wait!
Peace out!
and they don't play instruments!
I love GC!
GC is pop-punk, which I guess means that it has some punk influence, and also catchy beats.
Thay are POP!
And also, before the GC craze, the pop fanatics would have said- "punk?
I love Riot Girl, Wondering, Bloody Valentine- well everything!This CD rox!
ew!"
So does Good Charlotte!
but is it really such a bad thing that GC is mainstream?

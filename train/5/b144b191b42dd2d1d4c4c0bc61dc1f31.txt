Nothing Else Remains02.
Thankfully Poisonblack is picking up where Sentenced left off.
Pain Becomes Me09.
Great guitar riffs, leads and raspy, yet melodic vocals.
Very highly recommended.Tracklist:01.
Love Controlled Despair11.
Never Enough10.
I liked their debut, but this is a huge step forward.
This disc is for those of us who like the Finnish goth metal style, but without those annoying femme falsetto vocals and the pretty boy emo-image.
The Darkest Lie04.
This new Poisonblack album does have a lot in common with Sentenced's last cd.
The Living Dead
Mostly due to Ville Laihiala taking over vocals, but also because the music sounds a lot more like the Northernmost Suiciders than, lets say, HIM.
Rush05.
Raivotar07.
All the songs on this disc are great, but Soul in Flames and The Darkest Lie would have to be my picks for the best.
Nail06.
Hollow Be My Name03.
Soul in Flames08.

I am so thankful for this story.
I have tried book after book to help my 4 year old daughter get over the fear of monsters in her room.
I still can't get over the confidence it helped my daughter gain.
We have had the book a week and my daughter hasn't not cried or complained that their are monsters in her room since.
I am really shocked.
He wants to borrow it to share with his class.
I can't believe it.
My seven year old son even thought the story was funny and entertaining.
She carries it with her everywhere.
She loves the story and says it is her favorite book.
Very empowering for children.
This book is an unbelievable tool.
I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone but especially for children with nightime fears.
It looked cute and sounded helpful.
I decided to give Maggie and the Monster a try.
What a delightful story that shows the child with a little encouragement from mom, she can solve her own problems and feel good about it in the end.

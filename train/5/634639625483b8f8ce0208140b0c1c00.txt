I ordered this perch for our Timneh African Grey.
After several more days of avoiding that side of the cage totally, she ventured onto the perch.
After sitting it outside of her cage for a few days, I dared to add it to her cage.
It is a light pink color.
Don't bite.
This is great!
My only complaint is that the color is well, reminiscent of something that is usually delivered in a plain brown wrapper, if you know what I mean.
It looks like that.
And, there is food on the end if she tries hard enough!
And discovered that it did not eat parrots.
In fact, that crazy human left a rope to shred on it!
Yeah.
And, beads!
It cleans up easily, is easy to remove and replace, and the foraging thing at the end is a good way to get your bird started with foraging.
Wow!
"She really does seem to enjoy it.
Or, that is what I assume she would say if she could say more than " I'm a bad bird.

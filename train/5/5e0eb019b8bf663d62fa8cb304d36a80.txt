This has been typically Diana, hasn't it, a record for your mom.
I don't care much for many of her earlier albums, I find them too easy.
This is GREAT musicmanship (is this an english word?).
The Girls in the Other Room is, as I see it, is her first no-compromising album so far!
I've been listening to Diana Krall for a couple of years now.
What else do I like?
No strings, just bass, gitar and Diana.
Diana performs with a feeling for the music that is both unique and admireable.
This one I really enjoy.
Her best so far!!
She has been somewhat overhyped.
Miles, Mingus, Monk, and not to forget Polly Jean!!
I bought the CD "Love Scene" some while ago.
She is clever, but a bit too slick and easy.
I bought another record for my mom, it had string arrangements, but seemed descent.
And now: Diana Krall.

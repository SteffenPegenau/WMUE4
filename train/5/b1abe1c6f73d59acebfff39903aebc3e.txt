Usually Sony is irrationally expensive, but not this case.Pros:1) High quality bass.
Just bought 2 of these for gifting.I always buy quality stuff even if it is expensive.
Saw these first time at a colleague's desk, tried them in the extremely noisy lab and was impressed by the quality of sound.
When I heard the price I was blown away.
I usually listen on my notebook.
I have owned these for a year now.
I actually have to keep most of the cable folded.Cons:1) After a long stretch (3 to 4 hours) of use my ears ache a bit.
After all, ears weren't built for the headphones!
It still looks new.3) Long enough cable.
I am a bass lover, but I enjoy only the smooth bass.
:)
I have owned my set for a year now in a messy lab.
For that price you hardly get such quality sound.
This one is prefect for my taste.2) Sturdy build.
That's normal I believe.

You won't be disappointed.
Just close your eyes and you'll be able to hear everything she's thinking when she's singing.
In her first single " Through the rain" she sounds much like the rain.
Mariah Carey is the most talented singer.
Her vocals are strong.
Her more up beat songs are mediocre compared to all the ballads on here.
Just try this album out.
She Put alot of effort into this Album and you can hear it.
But no matter, it's still one of the most beautiful songs i've ever heard.
Shes Amazing.
Bringin' On The Heartache is really beautiful.
She is also one of the most hardworking artist.
She is one of the most successful women in the music business.
But it does sound as if shes holding back her vocals a little bit.
She sounds just wonderful.

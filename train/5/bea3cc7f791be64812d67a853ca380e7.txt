i bought the bronze package on steam and have been playing counter-strike source for about a month.
forget far cry.
i cannot wait.
i jus hope it can live up to its expectaions.
as of next tuesday hl2 will be available to play.
forget doom3.
hl2 is going to set the precident for video game technology for years to come.
i KNOW this problem will not be a problem while playing the single player hl2.
this game promises soo much.
really though i think it will surpass anything that has ever been done in the gaming industry.
everyday is a countdown for me and i am ticking off the seconds.
i have to say...cs:s is ok. the graphics and physics are great...but the source engine just doesnt run all that great on an online server.
HELL YEAH!
ok guys, brothers at arms.
the time has come.

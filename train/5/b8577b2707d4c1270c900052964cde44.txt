:)
I LOVE, I LOVE, I LOVE this album!
BUY!
The majority of the songs are sentimental, but in a light way that makes you more contemplative than sad.
Jewel sings with feeling.
I've never heard Jewel before this.
It doesn't matter if you're starving on the streets, as long as you can bring a discman and this album with you!
Other favourites are Standing Still, This Way, Serve the Ego...ah, to heck with it!
'Do You Want To Play' stands out because it sounds happier and louder than the rest, and is also one of my favourites.
BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!
The only song I don't like is Track 3!
My dad heard her on the radio and recommended her.
My teenage dangersense told me that it would be [bad] but boy was I wrong!
BUY!
"This Way" is something else, and I've never heard anything like it before (I usually listen to anything between Britney-pop to Creed to Vivaldi).

I was a bit worried that it wouldn't perform as it did in the videos online but I was proven wrong real fast!
My nosey neighbor had no clue I was working outside until he saw me!!
The tiller tore into the ground with ease and I had perfect planting soil in no time.
And it is quiet as stated.
Had the tiller outside within an hour!
Then I realized I didn't put on the kick stand yet but that was easy too and the kick stand is a great asset!!
weight allows even me to use and I have a bad back.
Took me about 20 minutes to put together.
It's 20lb.
I do think they should include the Tine Detangler with the tiller.
I purchased this with the hope of eliminating the neighborhood kid I had taking 6 hours to plant 4 plants @ $10.00/hr.
I received the tiller and watched the dvd (a must) and put it together - not hard to do if you watch the dvd.
No more neighborhood kid ripping me off!
I do it myself with my mantis tiller!!
He wanted $15!!
I highly recommend this product.

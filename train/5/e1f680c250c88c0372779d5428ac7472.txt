I personally have this one: [...]
But the role of Gérard is also key in this play.
If I had to choose, I would be difficult.I defenetely recommend to download the Callas aria of la mamma morta of 1955.
Milnes as Gérard as well.
Not all of the discs have the same quality.
Domingo, very young (the recording is from 1976) sounds superb.
This is not an easy-to-find version, I don't understand why, but I was very surprised to find it through Amazon.
Renatta Scotto also.
It's unbeatable.
This is one of those.
Becarful the versions.
Well, this is, with out doubt, one of the best versions of this opera.
It's an ADD recording.I Have another version, with Chailly conducting, and Pavarotti, Caballé and Nucci.
Opera lovers want an excellent Andrea Chénier, but also a superb Maddalena, to hear and hear again the magnificent La mamma morta.
This is another excellent version.
There are some operas in which the opera lovers look for the best.

Useful organization features.Cons: Voice activation is annoying sometime.
Records in MP3 format.
So if this is going to be an issue for you, get one that will record continuously.
Very easy to download.
Decent microphone.
I use this almost every day.
(I used rechargeable).
I have hundreds of hours of recording with it.
When the voice activation software can't detect sound, it stops recording, so you get this awful, jerky, runs all together recording and the software just can't deal with it.
There are no instructions on how to turn it off.
Batteries last long.
I have not filled it up.
I am a writer.
Tons of space.
I have used others and they are decent.Pros: Easy interface.
As such, I'm forced to transcribe my self which turns into hours instead of minutes.
The only complaint I have on this is that I use voice recognition to quickly transcribe my mp3 to text.

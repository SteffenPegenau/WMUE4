This album is on par with Jerky Boys 2.
You'll love it!!
Frank calls up a camp to complain that other kids have been picking on his son.
It's so funny!!!
He's says the other kids have been taking dumps in Mikey's (Frank's son's) laundry bag and have been "jagging" Mikey with a baseball bat.
"TV Repair" is also great.
Although Frank can't remember the name of the business, he does recall that some swill was dripping out of the back of the truck.
He wants to complain about a truck driver that backed up over his legs several times.
It's absolutely hilarious.
"Angry Camper's Dad" is riotous.
"1-800-How's My Driving" is quite possibly the funniest Jerky Boys clip ever.
Anyway, while he's on the phone Pico is trying to fix the set.
Frank Rizzo calls up one of those 1-800 numbers listed on the back of trucks.
You'll probably fall down from laughing when you hear that clip.
!
Pico almost gets electrocuted.
Kissel calls up a department store to complain about a TV he just bought there.

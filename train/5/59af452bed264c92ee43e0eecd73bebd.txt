I popped the CD into my CD player and never turned back.
Every song is a highlight, including "Silence" with guest singer Sarah McLachlan.
Enigma is the closest thing I can relate Delerium to, but they do sound different from one anorher.
What a beautiful album.
The lush female vocals and musical arrangements are extrodinary.
Delerium's "Karma" was an accident for me.
"Karma" is the album to get.
This album is not filled with standard pop fare.
It has chants/ethnic intruments/trip hop dance grooves and electronica elements.
I'm not joking.
There are a few instrumentals, and they are just as good as the vocalized songs.I have to be up front with you.
It has pop elements, but is designed more like a new "world" age album.
"Semantic Spaces" and "Poem" are okay, but "Karma" is the best.
I bought the wrong album back in 1997 at a Virgin Megastore thinking it was someone else.
Every track takes you somewhere.

Who we really are,what we think,why we act the way we do.
Dear Readers,I am a graduate of this book as well as a former client of the Author.I was at my very end, when we crossed paths.
By that I mean no one likes to face things.
Truth is, it was there all along.
That's not what this is.
At the end is that Peace and Happiness you longed for.
You aren't doing it alone.
Let God do his perfect work my friends.
My horrific past had finally caught up with me.
But you won't know that till you get YOUR healing.
This book is an incredible healing tool.
I too was afraid to trust yet another "self help" book.
This has a way.
The techniques can be hard and painful.
Those who are looking for hope, look here.
As for the negative comment I saw on here, running will get you nowhere.
Face the pain, face the shame, face the fear.
I was broken and out of all hope.
My best to you all.Kim Wohlert
With a vengence!

It is very clean and light and easy to use.
We have 2 dogs and 3 cats.
It shipped within a couple of days and was easy to "put together" and I used it right away.
The price was all right as well in my opinion.
the attachments are good too, we have carpet on the stairs and I have no problems with this one.
I have not had ANY problems with it.
I've had this for about one month and use it about 3 times a week.
My dogs shed a lot right now and we also have a lot of foot traffice so to speak.
It works great, the bags, although small, are long lasting,I have not had to change mine yet.
I have no complaints at all about this machine and can only recommend it.
And a 2 year old daughter.
The vacuum works great.
I love my new Electrolux.
Mind you, the "turbo" brush is not much of a turbo, most times I just use the regular floor piece, on the carpet setting.
We have hw floors and a large rug in the living room, bedrm is carpet.

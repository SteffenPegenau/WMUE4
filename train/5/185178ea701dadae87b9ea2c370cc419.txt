This is my sixth digital camera over the past five years.
Is it the best pocket sized digital camera?
No.
The LCD and the optics are recessed (protected).
For under $350, I think it is.
It's easy to hold.It's easy.
It also displays photos without delay.
The body is all metal.
The controls are minimal and smartly laid out.
Exposure and color are accurate.
Turn it on - the lens is ready in less than a second!It's solid.
No fancy bells and whistles.The image quality is surprising.
Although I use a professional digital camera for special events, I wanted a pocket size camera for convenience.It' fast!
Let me tell you - the autofocus speed is faster than most other point and shoot cameras.
Pictures are sharp and clear.Is it the ultimate digital camera?

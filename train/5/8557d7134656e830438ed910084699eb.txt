You'll get hooked!Rated Teen for strong violence and brutality.
You recieve pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, grenades, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, and many more.The graphics are nicely done.
Even the replay value is high!Jimmy Patterson is sent into enemy territory to find a special plane that could determine the fate of WWII.
You travel through mine shafts.
It gives you the feel of being in World War II.
You travel the streets of Germany.This game's weapons are great.
It was way better than the last one (Allied Assault).
The environments are very well done.
Medal of Honor : Frontline had to be one of the best first person shooters ever made.
Trust me!
You go to parties.
You storm the beaches of Normandy.
Nothing compares to it.
You play as Jimmy and go to many places.
Everything was great.
It was very realistic.I loved the game.
It is a must buy!

Well, that's bogus!
Everything you read out there tells you that you need not spend lots of money on HDMI cables or switch boxes and that a digital signal is all or nothing - sorta.
I can start enjoying my home theater.
I tried cheap hdmi cables and a cheap switcher I got from Walmart.
Job done - as advertised!
My run is 16 feet from the switcher and 4 feet to the switcher from the sources.
May not be your home theater set up and therefore may not be your fix or maybe it could have been fixed another way cheaper.
I have a 720P projector with a DVI-I input connected to a cheap Magnavox Blu-ray player and a Dish Network over the air DVR all via HDMI.
Thank you Belkin.
Time is money.
BUT it was my fix & I am done.
The fix?
No more devices not 'handshaking' and no more digital 'sparklies'.Yes folks, the answer was to spend a little more money for quality.
I had digital drop off problems.
Belkin Pure AV Silver HDMI cables and Belkin Pure AV 3 to 1 switcher.

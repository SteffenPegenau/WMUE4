i'm sure this wont be the last album from mest!!!
Mest do get better and better as they go on!!!
GREAT ALBUM!!
one more thing, why the hell do the japanese get a bonus track and we don't?!!!
they dont understand it anyway, so what is the point??!
IF YOU DON'T BUY IT, YOU ARE A MORON!!!!!
Mest deserve to be famous because they are so damn good!!
i hope they carry on getting better and better as they go on!!
!
like the TRANSPLANTS for example!
i still prefer tonys voice, but jeremiahs best work is on PHOTOGRAPHS!!
there are so many boring bands out there that are famous and they don't deserve it!!!
travis is a good drummer, but tim couldn't sing to save his life!!!
CURSED is the best song jeremiah has ever written!!
they are amazing!!!
I totally agree with the MELISSA/AKA/MEL with this.

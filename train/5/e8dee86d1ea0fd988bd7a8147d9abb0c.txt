These were originally on Black Lion both on lp and on disc.
Get this set.
!Get it while you can and it is not an mp3.
On lp, all this music was on three lp's.
I got it in England when i was a student there.
I have the reissues too.
The recordings quality on the original Black Lion recordings is astounding for the time.
Volume three was hard to get.
Many of Dexter Gordon's albums on Steeplechse recorded decades later do not sound as good as these.
Ben is playing with a modern bebop rhythm section that is really on.
The first two volumes were readily available here at budget prices.Then these discs were reissued.
How real is that?
It sounded so real and like I was there that I literally ducked to avoid being hit.
The sound was remastered and is fabulous.
I would listen to this music on headphones and there is a moment when it sounds like the bartender was throwing a glass liquor bottle in the trash.

"A woman drew her long black hair out tight/And fiddled whisper music on those strings/And bats with baby faces in the violet light/Whistled and beat their wings."
Dayadhvam.
Datta.
And the piano frame.
Damyata.
Shantih shantih shantih...
Yearning love music, fire-driven, clairvoyant, liquid.
Coltrane's harp chills, mesmerizes; modal piano poundings usher band into a breathless ether of passionate jazz.
I'm telling you the truth, lady.
This isn't lily wedding music.
Last night I made sweet love while listening to this: saxes, flutes, bass, and harp.
Eros meets Caliope, Caliope meets Telemachus in the vortex of desire.
Alice is a muse and her song fills the room.
Unreal.
It's its own terrain plane, gaspingly transcendent.
Think "The Waste Land"; this is the soundtrack.
Flickering candle songs, purple smoke and lace.
Echo craving.
Grace.

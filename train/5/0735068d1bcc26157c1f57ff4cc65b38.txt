Well, in the future we'll probably get DVD's with more.
This is, without any doubt, the best film made since, well, probably Seven.
If you like "no brainers", if that's what really gets you going then this is probably not for you.
Then you should love it.
But now, the DVD.
I'll keep this short.
But the thing is, if you love the film you've already got it.
Probably.
And for those who aren't quite sure, well.
And I sympathise.
I'm not going to explain plot or anything about the film other than... WATCH IT!
But if you like things a little different.
But what we'll never get is such a complete, perfect package.
If you like movies that make you think.
And if you hate it, all I can say is try watching it again.
NOW!
Then... WATCH IT AGAIN!

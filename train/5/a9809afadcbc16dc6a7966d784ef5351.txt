Frannie meets a new friend Celeste , who is black.
Frannie looks up upon her.
It had a great message.
She is 13 (like me!)
She has three best friends.
The main character is Frannie Driscoll.
We had to write our own review too!This book has excitement, racism, a ghost story, and even a luau!
I absolutely loved this book.
Frannie sets a good example for the rest of her friends.That's what I love about this book.
I know I did.Oh, by the way, the starplace is an old rocket ship slide that was apart of a playground that was taken down for haunted purposes.Thanks for reading my review!McKenzie Lambert....
Well I think you'll enjoy this book.
Frannie shows tolerance and shows that it doesn't hurt to have a black friend.
Kelly, who loves horses, Margot, who thinks she's French, and Nancy, who acts like a mom.
I was reading it for a school book report.
In this book there are mean examples of racism and since it's set in the 60's, no one thinks it's wrong.
Other people look down upon her.

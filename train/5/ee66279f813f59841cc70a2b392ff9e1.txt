One Of Us (8/10)9.
With dancefloor covers of Abba and Agnetha songs.
This is one of their only ballads on the cd(besides "One Of Us") which features dance tracks.
Take A Chance On Me (9/10)6.
Angel Eyes (10/10)3.
The bright spot on this cd by far, was "Wrap Your Arms Around Me," a cover of an Abba solo song originally performed by Agnetha.
I've owned this cd for over 5 years now and "Wrap Your Srms Around Me," never gets old.Other selection that make this cd worth buying are, "Angel Eyes," "The Winner Takes It All," "Eagle," and "The Day Before You Came.
Knowing Me Knowing You (8/10)8.
The Winner Takes It All (10/10)10.

The Day Before You Came (10/10)7.
Wrap Your Arms Around Me (10/10)
Summer Night City (9/10)2.

Firepaw is alot like Harry, they want to prove themselves and are adventurous.
Grawpaw is just like Ron, they like to joke around and are almost always thinking about thier stomachs.
Ravenpaw is just like Hermione they are cautious and are clever and quick.
This is for sure a book thay I would read over.
Everybodyshould read this book.
Tigerclaw is like Snape, they are cruel and dark.
I actually have some charecter comparisons.
Bluestar is like Dumbledore they are both witty and fair.
This book kept me interested with all of the action.
The book was very discriptive.
Cat lovers will love this book but just awarning there are cats that die!
In fact i just bought it two days ago and i have read it 1 1/2 time.
This is a great book.
Will keep Harry Potter fans at bay while they wait fir the new book.It is very similer to Harry Potter just without the magic and with cats.
Lionheart is like McGonagell.

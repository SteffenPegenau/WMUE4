I just saw Whitesnake 3 weeks ago and they ROCKED!
I have bootleg concerts recorded within the past few months that look professional compared to this, but the technology in 2011 affords us that.
This is a great concert.
No digital cameras.
This is a piece of rock history.
Most of my favorite bands from the 80's never video taped anything, so for this to exist in any form is a huge plus for me.
C'mon, people!
My iPod and my Sony Cyber-shot digital photo camera record better video than what existed in 1990.
I personally love it and enjoyed watching it.
As in video tape.
Too soon these DVDs will be our only salvation in a world of boring, cookie-cutter, flavor-of-the-week rock music.
These great, real rock bands aren't going to be around forever.
A great band.
T A P E D !!!
No 2011 technology.
This was TAPED 21 years ago.
Get over the quality and enjoy the DVD for what it is - a place in time we'll never get back to.
A great DVD to own.

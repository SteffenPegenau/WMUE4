Sour grapes?
We get it, okay?And if you doubt that it's the same person making each one of these 1-star reviews...look at how they use the same phrasing and terminology over and over...accusing fantasia of being a "duck" (huh?
Hmmm.
Makes you wonder.Fantasia was and is the American Idol of 2004.
)...and being "squeaky"...and using the "yeah, yeah, yeah's".Could it be obsessive compulsive disorder?
Let it go.
Simon knew it...Paula Knew it....Randy knew it.
You'll feel better.
And America knew it.Get over it already, Mr. or Mrs. Squeaky-Duck Reviewer.
For someone to take this much time and energy to convince everyone that they don't like Fantasia...is just a tad...obsessive.
Whoever this person is...it is blatantly obvious there is something not-at-all right about this person.
She deserved to win...because she was the best.
And so will we.
Alcohol?
A head injury?

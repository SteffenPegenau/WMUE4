The Rookies3.
Its well worth the price and then some.
I grew up watching these shows, and there is not a cop show today that can hold a candle to these shows.
Swat5.
Let me tell you, I LOVE this dvd.
Starsky and Hutch4.
I just hope they realease more Police Woman and Starsky and Hutch on dvd.
Get it....
Police WomanI love all these shows, but I espacially love Police Woman and Starsky and Hutch.
Charlies Angels2.
I have been waiting for these shows to be released on dvd format for a long time.
You get the first episodes of 5 classic 70's cop shows.1.
This is a great dvd of classic tv, when tv was entertaining, not all this reality crap that is on now.
I have some Charlie's Angels on dvd, and Starsky and Hutch on VHS from Columbia House, but I have missed watching Police Woman in over 25 years.
I had a serious crush on Angie Dickinson back in the day.

Thank you for reading this review.
On a positive note, the company responsible for the book, will not handle orders for the second book.
The review that claims the book is mostly made up of cheesy line art is a joke.
If you can speak from nothing but ignorance of the subject, please don't speak at all.
This book is filled with new and old art, spanning the various incarnations of the Transformers.
So hopefully, they won't be screwing anybody else over.
To the person who directed their review at the company, don't take it out on the book please.
Other that that, perfection.
For the most part the art is fantastic.
I find it to be quite excellent.
Back in April I believe.
Personally, I only found one dissapointing illustration in the whole book.
Looking foward to part two.
I find it unfortunate this book has received such poor reviews thus far.
I haven't received mine either.
I too ordered a copy.
I simply bought one from Amazon.

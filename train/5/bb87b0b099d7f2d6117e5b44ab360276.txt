Like movies are supposed to be.
If you're a fan of the PREDATOR and ALIEN movies, than you will love this!
Well this one is everything the first one should've been.
What happened to the good old days when people enjoyed movies for what they're for, fun.
Now everybody just looks for ways to cut them down and "criticize".
It has the brutality and feel of the originals.
If you like blood, guts, action, amazing visuals, predator, alien, and being entertained, this movie rules.
Amazing!
The first AVP was a bit of a let down for one simple fact, it was rated PG-13.
Bottom line, it's entertaining.
Don't listen to all the bad reviews.
Everyone's a crittic these days, geese.
A movie isn't really supposed to teach you a lesson or make you "smarter", it's supposed to take you out of the stressfull world we live in for a couple hours.
How the hell are you gonna do a versus of the two most brutal and best sci-fi series in the world, and make it PG-13??!!
Anyway, enough of that.

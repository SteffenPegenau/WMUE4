This was the first chapter boo kI could actually sit through.
You dont have to buy it you could just go to a friends and borrow it or the library.
Listen to me here, if you havent read this book yet read it.
Whereever you get it dont base it off of the bad reviews because many people like it.
How could anybod y not like this I have read it over 50 times and have lost it only 100!
It is not the books or authors fault that everyone makes fun of it!
And, also, BYE!!!
!
Not Twights fault!
The love between the characters is totally awe worthy!
It is not like the whole world hates it.Remember this is a good book!
I may have been onl in fourth grade when I read this but seriously all those one stars!
How could no one like this book how!?
And that is only because of the movie!
the movie was dumb, sure, but the book is the best thing ever!!!

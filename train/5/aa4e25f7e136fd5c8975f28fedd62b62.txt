I'd never heard of it.
Everyone should leave Tommy alone now and let him write another book.
This is a really good book--especially for a U.P.
kid who I watched almost flunk out of high school!
He gave a moving talk and read from Chasing the (Aral) Sea.
Little Tommy Bissell (what we call him here) has written a lot that we in the U.P.
I have known and loved Bissells.
But now I have.
Good people.
The Upper Peninsula Bissells are not, however, related to the Lower Michigan Bissells of vacuum cleaner fame.
I feel smarter.
That's a service.
He came and spoke in his home town and we went out to see him.
have not always been happy with, but we're proud of him.
I guess Tommy has always been good at making enemies, the "brainy little know it all" that he is!!

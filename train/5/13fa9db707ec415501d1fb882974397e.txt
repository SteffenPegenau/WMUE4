I am just very happy they are putting all the sets on DVD.
If you enjoy detective series, this is one of the best out there.

I am a fan of police shows, and the change to the British countryside and culture has a nice feel to it.
The stories, acting, directing, sets, and scenery are great.
All the sets are available in the UK, but haven't been released as Region 1 in the US.
I do wish they put them in seasons rather than sets, because you end up buying sets that you aren't sure what season they were.
We were all sorely disappointed when they did not continue to air them.
I highly recommend this series.
The set is the slim case type.
I just ordered sets 9 and 10 for my mom's birthday.
Each set contains four mysteries.
I had already bought several sets on DVD for my mother when they ceased televising them.
The DVD quality is first class and they have excellent replayability.
My wife, mother, and I followed these when they aired on a couple cable networks.

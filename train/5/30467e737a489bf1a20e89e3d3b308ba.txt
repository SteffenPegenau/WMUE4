.
It's easy, fast and does exactly what it says it will.
I've owned one of these for 2 years now, and I love it!
I bought this one for my son who's leaving home soon.
How often do you find that today?
Don't.
It's the fastest brew in my house, besides being a darn good cup of Joe.
Just go the extra little bit of money for the actual made-to-fit filters.
.
and it's good!
I love the versatility - I prefer a strong brew, but others may prefer something a bit more liquid.
Just a sidenote - it says that you can make the filters out of coffee filters cut to measure.
They're worth it!
When I need to get out of the house - now - I can actually get my coffee from start to finish in less than 2 minutes .
With this wonderful press, you can definitely have it your way!

... Trust me: just buy it, read it, and make everyone else in your band read it, too!
... Yeah, it's a BIG book with a lot of legal jargon and business mumbo-jumbo.
... You will NEVER regret it - NEVER!
... Read this book now - NOW!
... "Listen-Up, Spuds!"
- The Aeolian Kid
...
... Yeah, it's kind of COSTLY.
You WILL get a number of laughs out of this book, too.
- as DEVO and Neil Young would say - and heed this advice: DON'T Put It Off !!!
...
Ignore it at your own peril!
... TOO BAD!
Besides, Donald Passman writes like a real pro and makes it interesting and fun to read.
... Yeah, it's a HARDCOVER.
- before you get in so deep into the deep water in the deep end of the pool, and don't know what happened, how to deal with it, or what you can do to get out of it without having to hire a lawyer for THOUSANDS of dollars to save you from economic ruin!
... Read it NOW, before it's too late!
It's THAT good... YOWZA!

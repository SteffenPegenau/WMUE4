Ok .
.
.
.
.
keeps things very interesting .
it has some gruesomeness to it so it you have a weak stomach it may not be your cup of tea .
it started out a bit slow .
I will admit .
what's cool is if you know these writers well, you can distinguish which parts of the book are primarily written by which author and I love that .
.
.
.
but once it got rolling I'm having a hard time putting it down, even at work - great plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat .
.
it's one of those books that just sucks you in and is a total page turner .
mixing reality with supernatural .
just like The Talisman was too .

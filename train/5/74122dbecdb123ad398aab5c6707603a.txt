I sue this one for the main course, and the shallow 6-quart for desert and bread.
The legs on the botton and lip on the lid allow you to place charcoals under and over for outdoor cooking.
The iron is smooth (no sharp, bumpy finish like cheaper ovens).
We also use it for frying and browning (bacon, ground meat, etc.
What else can I say.
Note that this is the deep version of the 12" oven.
Perfect for camping.
Anything you can cook in the oven at home can be cooked in a dutch oven.
If you take care of it, this dutch oven will last generations.
We also have a 6 quart (shallow) version.
I would recommend this one, as you have more room to play with.
The lid is reversible and can act as a small skillet as well.
Pot Roast, lasagna, corn bread, cakes, cobblers, chili.
I have a 10" that I use for keeping things warm.
Plus it's made in the USA!

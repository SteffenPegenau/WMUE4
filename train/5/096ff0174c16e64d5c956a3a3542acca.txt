I was like this is really good, its got some good beats and some good ryhmes.
You got to get use to it, its something new.
I was so hyped about this album.
Watch the tv as music video after video comes out, and then you'll like it.
After I listened through the cd.
A lot better than the first cd.
Won't stop, can't stop.
And as much as you don't want to admit it(haters) his ryhmes are a lot better.
Something hot.
When I finally bought it I was very dissapointed.
I was expecting something really hot.
Even though he does rap slow on some of the tracks, they are still good.
And if you think you shouldn't get this cd, u previewed it and are like this is going to be a waste.
I knew this was going to be one of the best.
But I was to blind to see it.
And before you hate this cd, Listen threw it several times.
Then the second time I listened to it, I'm like this is extremely good.
Like Bad Boy said "this is a cd that will go down in history".
FOREVER.

It is the first Madonna CD that I ever owned!
ENJOY!!!!
Nonetheless, this CD rocks.
I know you'll like it.
I recommend it to everyone.
!
I knew it would be a huge hit the second I listened to it.
It's so good.
I really like teh songs MUSIC, RUNAWAY LOVER, and DON'T TELL ME.
It goes into more of a slow more depressing mood than the very upbeat Ray Of Light CD.
Runaway Lover is just a great song.
This is such a great CD.
The rest of the CD is really good, too!
And Don't Tell Me is awesome.
Music is a fun dancy tune.
It's better than AMERICAN LIFE, but not as good as RAY OF LIGHT.

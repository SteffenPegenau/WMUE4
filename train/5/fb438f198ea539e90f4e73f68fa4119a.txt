If there's one thing I've learned from this movie, it's this:"Life is like a box of chocolates.
You never know what you're gonna get."
But it is so much more than that.
When it's over, you immediately want to watch it again.
I wouldn't be surprised if the idea of the film didn't interest people.
Put simply, I was blown away.
A guy on at a bus stop tells people about his life.
I never thought I could get into it.
Actually, I'm prepared to say that this is the single greatest performance by an actor I've seen (and I've seen some good ones!).
For a long time, Forrest Gump was just 'that movie my parents like.'
It's that good.
Out of all the Tom Hanks films I've seen, this one is by far the greatest.
But one day we watched it at school.
Forrest Gump, although long, is never boring.
There is always something, whether it be humorous or heart-breaking, going on.

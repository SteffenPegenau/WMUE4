Why be upset over a relationship with a girl?.
Love Is on my ankle.
Actually last week I went and got my first tattoo.
Cause if you move right?
It is the highest point.
But the pain is real and this movie protrays that.
This line from the movie has been in my head since I watched it.
This is an excellent movie for anyone who has every experience heartbreak with their lesbian lover.
It is the point of why we are here.
U fall."
U fall.
This is an awsome movie for anyone who wants to have a good cry.
"Love Is.
It just is and nothing you can say can make it go away.
And when your up there looking down your there forever.
Like how I first felt.
It makes the pain not look silly or unimportant.

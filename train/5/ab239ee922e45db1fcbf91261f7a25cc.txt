I disagree when they say that they are trying to be the Back Street Boys.
Joey has got the bodd.
He also has a (to die for) smile.
He's 100% all guy!
I love this song.
He called and requested this song for me.
Chris, (skunk man), is trying to be himself.
Think about that for a while.
While the other guys are trying to do the style thing, with the baggy pants and stuff, he choses to be himself.
Justin has the kind of voice that tuches your life, he knows how to get your atention, and he KNOWS girls by the millions.
J.C. is sweet.
They are Rare, and ginuine.
If they are trying to be anyone, it's the New Kids On The Block.
I can see it in his style and in his face.
The New Kids where, "All That!"
It reminds me of my boy friend.
Lance is as plane as it gets.
I can see it in his eyes and in his moves.

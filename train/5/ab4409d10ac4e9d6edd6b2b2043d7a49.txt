That's "Sloop John B", by Brian Wilson!
Buy it now!
As I started to listen...
Don't like 60's music?
Ever feel guilty flipping to the oldies station in the car?
These guys are having some fun without poking fun.
My new favorite album, hands down.You'll know every song on here.
Me First, that's what!
WAIT!
Like both?
No more.
Have fun too.
You will.
I've listened all the way through five times, and I'm ready for another five.
Needless to say I bought it.
You'll absoultely LOVE this album.I was at my local books-and-music store (yes, I shop in person and online) browsing computer books when I found my feet tapping and my head doing a serious 4-4 beat along to some song I'd never heard of with a seriously rockin' intro.
You will.
Don't like Punk?
What Gives?
This stuff really rocks.

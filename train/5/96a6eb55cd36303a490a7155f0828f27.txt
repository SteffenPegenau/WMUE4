How?
So the dream is already, in many ways, dead.
The space programs that were developing the next generation of spaceships, reusable rockets, have been brought to a halt by the current President.
We WERE better off going back to the Moon because, no matter how you slice it, we HAVE to to explore the rest of space.
It would be a pit stop to Mars, Venus, deep space.
Oh well, dream on.
You land, refuel, grab a soft drink, a sandwich, and launch off into space.
Without an American space station, or space shuttle, or Moon base?
Mining the Moon would seem like a wonderful idea.
Really?
NASA has been told it is going to Mars.
The Moon can become, basically, a gas station.
Free energy.
What?
Hydrogen, oxygen, water, all trapped on the Moon, ready for us to come and take it!
This DVD shows how it could be done, how we could mine it, what can be done with the material found there!The problem is the DVD is from 2009 and, sad to say, is outdated.

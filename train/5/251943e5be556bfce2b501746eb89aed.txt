Yes it is awsome wiht them.
it is more acurate with the .20 but they are slower.
The only problem is that on my gun you have to push the clip in a littttlle bit further so it is fully in there and it will cock.
Just keep adjusting it untill you find the right place.
So if you are worried that it wont be good with .12 then dont be casue it is great.
This is on the end away from you.
!
On mine one end of the hop up aduster thing is on the 3rd big notch and the ohter end is on the 4th big notch.
The clip is cool and it loads completly into the gun.
It shoots awsomley acurate and far.
Now one of my first questions was is it good with .12 bbs?
And they arent that more acurate.
All together this gun is awsome!!!!!!!
It is on the left side of the barrel about halfway down.
but it isnt hard to do at all.The acuracy is great but you have to adjust the hop up a little bit.
This gun is so awsome.

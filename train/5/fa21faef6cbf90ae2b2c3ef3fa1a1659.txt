And I am thrilled.
Sometimes I shudder at the interpretations (at times a bit too classical for me), but an adult can always explain the stories.
And I have bought a handful of children's Bible literature so when I read a review for this book I thought, great!
But my little boy (8) saw it and asked me to read it.
and was ready to send it back.
And he just loves it!!
He asks for more, always more... even though he has tons of other books on his shelves.
I told myself, "another flop!"
The stories are very simply put and illustrated, exactly like a child needs.
I bought this book after several attempts to get my children interested in the Bible.
This book has an amazing calming effect on kids, and it seems to fill a need they have.
When the book arrived my heart fell.
I always look for metaphysical interpretations for children, but am not sure they exist.
Amazing!
I think it is a perfect first approach to the Bible.

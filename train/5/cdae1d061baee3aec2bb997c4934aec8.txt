I couldn't put The Hot Box down.
It's that damn good.
It is a must have for all ZANIACS!!
!
Thank you so much Zane once again, for being a beautiful black woman, and giving us some of the greatest books!!
I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.
Thanks soooooo damn much for bringing some excitement in my life.
YOU DID GIRL!!
Didn't even know you had a new book until I walked into my local Wal-Mart, who never has anything.
For all of those reading this, if you haven't gotten it GET IT NOW!!
I read it in 16 hours.
When I saw Zane is bold letters I knew I had hit the jackpot!
WOW!!
Our girl has brought drama, suspense, love, confusion-all to this book.
I couldn't wait to get to the next work, page, paragraph, chapter!

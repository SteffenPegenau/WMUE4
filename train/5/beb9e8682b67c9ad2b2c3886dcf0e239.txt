There are 5 episodes with commentaries!
Jerry Supiran could use some more pep in his voice when commenting.
over TV DVDs will only have commentaries on 1 episode.
Hopefully this will be corrected in Seasons 2, 3, and 4.Marla Pennington's comments are very sweet.
(First season so far.
I will say, Dick Christie's voice level is not loud on the commentaries.
Eventually, the robot develops human feelings.
If anything good came out of syndication, this is the show!
Usually, if there are commentaries on episodes.
This beauty of a gem is finally available on DVD!
It was a unique story of a family that invents a robot to be their daughter.
The legendary Edie McClurg is funny as ever.Buy this set now and you will not be disappointed.
)You probably already know about the show so let me tell you about he extras.

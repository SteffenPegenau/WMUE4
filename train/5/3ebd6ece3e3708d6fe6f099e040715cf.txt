(the Black Faced Vervet!
Two field guides and a novel.
This guide is worth it's weight.
It's all important.
)The explanations and observations really enriched our animal viewing encounters.
Based on others reviews I chose the full colour photo guide by Withers and this one; the Estes.
Very much like a text book but, much more interesting.
Wishes for future edition would be the inclusion of the social behavior of the Ostrich as they are such a large and obvious member of the Savannah.
My ten year old was so glad to learn so much about her favorite monkeys.
When you see an Eland bull lower it's horns the Estes explains why.
Easy to read and understand the symbols and charts.
We took only three books with us.
When you see a group of elephants and they are all male the Estes tells you why.
Just returned from two weeks of safari in Tanzania.
It's not small.

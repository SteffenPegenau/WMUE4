It won't take 30 minutes to get to a neighborhood or a lot or downtown anymore.
I got this for christmas.
Here's a hint for all of u with a slow sims 2 or sims 2 pets game.
but i strongly suggest buy more ram.
Buy more ram.
we did and it helped a lot.
more like 1..if that long even.
anyways this is a great expansion.
this game takes up a lot of memory.
when an old cat moved in to a lot she died in a few hours sim time.
it made me wanna cry.
and it was sad cuz her son was sitting by her grave all the time.
and the pets are adorable.
anyways this game is great.
buy.

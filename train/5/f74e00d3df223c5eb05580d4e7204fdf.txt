You will be blessed by this book.
But, I still had many whys.
But, God is good- it is not a coincidence you are wondering if this book can help you.
My husband took his life.
(We were married for 3 years but, because of jobs and needing to sell a house - we lived in different states.)
Mr. Cox will give you the tools and God's word on it.
I have been asking why.
Then gave me a way to heal my hurts and doubts.
I got some answers going thru papers after he died.
But, you have to make that choice.
I wasn't 100% convienced he was in heaven.
It can help you move beyond the grief and dispair.
This book answered a lot of whys for me & assured me my husband is in heaven.
If you need a book to help you thru a suicide- this is the best one I read.
I recommend it highly and I am sorry for your loss.

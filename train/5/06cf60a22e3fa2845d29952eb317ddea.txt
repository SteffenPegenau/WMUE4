Fliegler's writing is unpretentious.
In this digital crazy world, it is refreshing to read about those who spend a life's effort trying to create a totally subjective, analog product that cannot be graphed, charted, or placed into another database.
You do not need to be a musician nut to enjoy it.
That "sound."
Not for money or power, but for the passionate pursuit of an elusive goal.
It's nice to read about people dedicated to their jobs.
It reveals just how important that "sound" was to the history of Rock, as the Rock groups, themselves.
Yet, not an easy task.
It's that simple.
He has a pure love of the amplifier's role in Rock & Roll.
Ritchie Fliegler cuts right to the heart of Rock & Rock.
I highly recommend this book.
He describes the efforts of many to capture that sound.
When that "sound" is heard---the amplifier's designer knows he's onto something very good.
This helps to emphasize the luck and persistence needed by these amplifier designers.

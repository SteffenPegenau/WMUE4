"What were those judges thinking anyway?
Both of these songs are wonderful!
I can't wait to hear more from him and I'll certainly buy his CD when it comes out.
I love the harp in the background on "Bridge Over Troubled Water."
Clay has a style that is all his own.
Clay's range is remarkable.
For an "untrained" voice, Clay is amazing!
Even if you've never heard this man sing, I highly recommend this CD because his voice is so fantastic!
Way to GO Clay!
I seldom buy single CD's but this one is well worth the price.
He'll be selling CD's and singing on Broadway!
His voice allows him to sing in any genre!
He puts so much emotion into the songs he sings.
Because all 3 of them said they didn't like this song.
I thought it was the perfect song for the occasion and for Clay's wonderful voice.
As a home viewer, I must have heard it much better than they did.
But my favorite one is "This Is the Night!

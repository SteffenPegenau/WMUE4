I had given up.
Thanks Webber.
I am a bbq failure and have been for years.
I've bought more bbqs than I can count.
What a brilliant piece of engineering.
Yes, you can fit a lot of food on it and it all cooks perfectly no matter where it is on the grill.
I thought I was too stupid to bbq.Tonight I used the Baby Q for the first time and it made me look like Bobby Flay on my first try out.
You rock and rule the bbq kingdom.
And, it came off of my grill.
It made the most perfectly cooked, grill marked, juicy hamburgers I ever tasted anywhere.
The flame comes up when the juices drip off but does not set the whole thing on fire.
My hat is off to you.
I've waited my whole life for this one.
Easy assembly and obvious quality construction.
I am blown away.The smokey flavor, the searing, the speed and ease of use is the best.

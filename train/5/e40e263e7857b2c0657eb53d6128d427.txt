But That's what's so great about this movie, just let your self get lost in one of the coolest cult horror/comedies ever!!!
Everything about it!
the acting godawful!The humor is darker than a shadow!
Aaaaaaw geez, where do I begin?
This is the perfect movie to put on at a party to make people either puke from the gore, or just puke from laughing so hard!
You'll find yourself watching this one over and over and over just because it's so ridiculously violent & funny.
!
The gore is over the top and unnecessary!
What other movie features a man who falls off a mountain then explodes once his body hits the ground, and here's the funny part about it.....15 minutes later we come back to him and he's still alive!
The violence is pointless and blunt!
Bad Taste just kicks so much [rear] its insane!
No it doesn't.
(they are extremely thick).
Does it make any sense at all?
But he blew up didn't he?
Yes he did.
And you also get a kick out of the accents too!

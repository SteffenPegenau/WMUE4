This is fantastic.
I've had extensive body work; massages, chiropractor, yoga, physical therapy.

In the beginning you may feel discomfort, but once you relax into it, it's incredible.
I've even noticed my jackets and clothes fit better.
I haven't measured myself but based on my clothes I would swear I grew at least an inch.
I now use it at least 15 minutes a day.
You need to slowly adjust your body, find your comfort zones.
I'm aware for others with more serious problems it may not help but for the average person it truly helps.
I just love my Spine Worx!!
My spine feels better than it has in 20 years!!!
However, this is amazing how something so simple has been so effective (for me).
I also sleep better and am more relaxed, yet energized thoughout the day, no more afternoon naps needed.
I almost gave up after the first 3 times because I did feel a little sore but I'm SO GLAD I didn't.
All it took was some time and minor adjustments.

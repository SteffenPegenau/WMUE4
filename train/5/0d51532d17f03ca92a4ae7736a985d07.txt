Most authors make their characters perfect, but Ella has real thoughts.
I love it!
But I still love this book.
It has such a wonderful ending!
Char sounds like the type of rare guy who acts like a human-being and is the girl's ideal prince.
Ella Enchanted is my most favorite book ever.
Because of this I'm looking forward to the movie Ever After, though I hoped that they'd base the movie after Ella Enchanted.
Goodness, I'm talking nonsense.
I love it!
I love it!
I love it!
I love it!
Ella is such a wonderful person, kind, nice, spunky, and very real.
I cry every time I read this book, I don't know why.
My god, I love it!
You can't every put it down.
Their loss.

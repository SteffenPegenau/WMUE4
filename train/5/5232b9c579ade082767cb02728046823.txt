If you plan to unglue, please don't use this product.
It gives me so much fun, just using it for virtually every broken object in my house.
In the meantime, let me see if there's something else I need to glue.
I've experimented with glues, and I mean all kinds of glues.
OMG.
Then came home and followed the instructions.
it glues everything.
Please, be careful with this product around children.
I've used it on brick, on wood, on metal, on plastic, on my screen.
And takes only two hours to dry.
Be careful.
I must confess I was a bit hesitant, thinking about past experiences with other glues.
Do not fool around with it.
I have to warn you.
This is a bonding glue.
This thing can glue eyes together and it will take Dr. Jesus to have them open.
Then went to Walmart and purchased the Gorilla Glue to fix the brick that chipped off my steps.

YES!
Rarely are we moved, in a live groove experience way, by recorded material and if you loved the first two productions from these blues rock gods, this will hit the spot.
Is this TOTALLY ECLIPSED by the pure tallent of the band, and the amazing things they're doing?
Is the sound quality excellent?
Does this album have more soul and feel than ANYTHING else I've experienced lately?

You should buy the CD because the music KICKS!
It's punk/ska, perhaps punk-pop, but it is GOOOD!
I listen to this CD every day.
This CD has something for everything.
So, buy the CD, and all the people like me will be happy and shut up about it.
Also good to scream at the top of your lungs while running through deserted hallways.
Wow.
Whooo!
The songs are so fun and catchy.
It tasty.
What an AWESOME CD!
I am Lday O, off nerr VA!

If you are thinking about buying this CD, i have to things two say to you: Why didn't you have it before, and GET IT GET IT GET IT!
I mean, I always knew Joel Madden was dead sexy, but that's NOT the reason why you should buy the CD.

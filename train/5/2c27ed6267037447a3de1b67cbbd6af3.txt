Oh, how naiive I was.
The best part of the doc.
I originally saw this doc.
Kurt Cobain turned me onto lots of music, including Daniel.
At first I thought it was terrible, just another artist that pretentious people enjoy.
The whole story is almost mythological, really.
is how well Daniel managed to record his life over the years using tape recorders, cameras etc.
I first heard Daniel Johnston a few years ago when I was in high school.
And what a life he has had.
THANKS AMAZON!
Now I can watch it in the comfort of my own home.
He puts all the pain, ugliness, and humor of his life into his art.
in a theater and I must say, it is equally parts hilarious, moving, and tragic.
This documentary will show you why Daniel Johnston is one of the most important songwriters/artists alive today.
The filmmakers must have wet their pants when Daniel handed that stuff over.
I mean, he recorded EVERYTHING.

it is like 4x's bigger than it looked in the picture!!
i am so glad i ordered it!
plus you can rearrange the bottom with dividers also!
it comes with 12 dividers!
OMG i looooove it!!!!
it is very sturdy and is HUGE!!
but thats mostley it.
the only thing i would like to change is that it is VERY hard to get the dividers in the second row.
i am going to be adding a picture soon!
it looks and probably is one of the proffesional ones and i am soooooo glad i spent the money on it becuase it was sooooo worth it!!!
thats alot.
oh well i still love it!
but it took a while to get here.
and i am soooo glad i got it!!!
i overall like it!

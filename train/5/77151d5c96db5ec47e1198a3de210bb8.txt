I am glad I did!
I normally wear socks as my feet will sweat in these without them!
I wear a 9 1/2 shoe size and took the recommendations of a few postings here and ordered a half size up (10).
wear them everywhere!
Even in the rain!
Well I don't normally write reviews but thought I would "pay it forward" as the reviews posted for this item helped me in my decision.
Cozy, Cozy, Cozy!
They fit perfect with or without socks.
To the store, friends house, etc.
!
Nice durable sole.
These are awesome slippers!
Would definitely recommend these slippers!
I wear them to check the mail and walk my dog around our (large) apartment complex.
Very cozy inner lining.
I had put them on and we left and did not realize til we got to the theater I was still wearing my new slippers.
First day I got them ended up unknowingly wearing them to the movies with my daughter.
Best pair I've owned thus far!

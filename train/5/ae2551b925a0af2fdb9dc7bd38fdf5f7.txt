But, you really can't beat it for the price.
Great bang for the buck!
Bought it to replace the one I've had for the last 23 years.
Good wide base for stability in transport.I have to say the shipping was a little more than expected.
Glad I bought it.
Good instructions too.
When the motor quit's turning... you're done!
Easy to use.
Hard to beat Amazon's service whether it is coming from them or a second party.
If you've never made home made ice cream, they take you through it step by step.
And, as usual, it arrived sooner than they suggested it would.
What can I say...?
Love it!
Can't go wrong with this one.
Not real loud.
Makes great ice cream!

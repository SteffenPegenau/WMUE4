the engine is the same, but quicker.
so problem solved.
if you're new to the tony hawk world, give it a shot.
the reverts make for great combo potential.
also the create a skater/move list editor is a lot better.
theres a lot of music that isn't too good.
the one thing that i'd have to say needs work is the soundtrack.
once you get a hang of it the game is great.
you unlock special slots instead of earning money.
so you have to play a bit to be accustomed to it.
that was a pain in thps2 and fixed now.
but thats just my own prefrence.
however, you can tell the game what to play and what to skip.
if you were a fan of the first two, go for this.
this way you can use any trick you want.
the same goes for your stats and boards.

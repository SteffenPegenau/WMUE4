One of such books was "Conversations With God : An Uncommon Dialogue".
Then it happened.
However, I agreed to read the book but never asked again.
I had been reading a lot of books and articles which either dismissed the reality of hell or at best, rationalised it.
Then I lived in London, UK.
Prior to this, I never discussed my 'convictions' about the 'figurative' nature of hell with her, because she is a Christian.
This book was brought to my attention by a divine miracle.
The effect?
Awesome!
As if by divine appointment, she persisted.
Thank the Lord Jesus for this book and for my friend, Joy, whom God used, I was otherwise a sure candidate for hell fire.
Seemingly out of the blues, a friend of mine called me to say that she just bought a book which I just had to read.
It was the end of 1999.
I then took the book and read it.
In fact, I was already sold, intellectually, on the idea that hell did not exist.

I wish the executors of Jim and Pamela Morrison's estates would let their fans see it.
Pam loved Jim.
They were meant for each other and I like to think of them together forever in the 'ether' as Ray has phrased it.
One day maybe.
As well as other footage.
Anyway one thing is very clear to me.
It's that simple.
I have to add that I would love to see that footage of Pam and Jim cavorting in a Moroccan (if memory serves) cemetery.
Heaven I mean.
Jim loved Pam.
I bought this book as a Doors fan.
:)
I would have enjoyed it anyhow.
These two star-crossed 'Cosmic Mates' are among the most intriguing Rock couples of those long ago 1960's.
I was left wanting more and I hope she writes another one.
She mentions in the book that she had received so much information-too much to include in the book.
Patricia Butler adds some interesting previously unknown details about Pamela and Jim Morrison-especially Pam.
Peace and Love.

So i just bought this cage for my pitbull.
plenty of room.
This thing is huge.
Compared the one we were borrowing anyway.
or if you have 2 small yappers then this is good too!
So, if your dog is about or under 3 ft tall sitting up, then get this cage.
WE were borrowing a crate and had to give it back.
Now any other company that says the cage is that size is nuts.
She can stand up and not hit her head.
The only thing i will say is the pan for the bottom seems a little cheap but who am i to complain.
So i found this one.
Shes full grown and is crate trained.
My dogs happy and confortable.
Paid 55 dollars for it and that includes shipping.
I got the one that is 36".
Lets put it this way, a grown adult could get inside and sit fine.
This thing is tall and roomy.

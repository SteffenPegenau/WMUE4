I've owned Amnesiac for over a year and a half now.
I bought it just for Pyramid Song; I had no idea how many other unbelievable tracks were on this superb album:1.
Amnesiac is one of the best albums they've ever made in my opinion; I reccomend buying it if you haven't already; give it time, give it a chance.
There's not really much to say that's already been said by a lot of other people.
Morning Bell/Amnesiac - 9/108.

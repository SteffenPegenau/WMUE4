Here is a track listing:1.
CAN'T WAIT!
This CD deserves to be #1 ALL over the world, and hopefully it will be released in the U.S. Jan. '07 as planned (it was originally set for an August 29th release, but then it was postponed because of failed radio play).
Take Me Away7.
Wait9.
I'm Not Missing You3.
Beautiful AwakeningAnd there is an enhanced video of her single supposedly, all the more reason to order this CD, I couldn't wait until Jan. '07 for it so I ordered my copy last week and its on its way to me as I write this.
Babygirl8.
Save Me6.
The first single "I'm Not Missing You" is one of the best songs I have heard in the past 3 or 4 years and it deserved to be recognized as being so (at least in my opinion it did).
Is It Me10.
Easy To Luv You5.

Don't Ask Me To Stay11.

So Simple2.

You get right to moving and you do move!
It starts with standing horse stance arm moves.
What I like is the way they don't talk for hours before you are actually doing anything.
The yoga is different than a lot of other DVDs I've done and because of that, I am never bored with it.
No matter how down I feel, I am up when I am finished!
I am not normally a fan of yoga but raviana has got me hooked!
Overall this feels very cardio like their other workouts.
Like I said, this isn't like the traditional yoga where you are holding poses.
Over time it feels like this workout is actually changing my cells and brain matter.
I now have a few of their programs and Transformer is a favorite.
Ravi & Ana bring such warm and fun energy to their DVDs that you want to do the workouts over and over again.
It also has some ab work and all the other workout must haves.
I actually sweated doing this.
You are moving and breathing.
LOL, but it's true!

5 minutes total installation.Placed in front of my fireplace, on the brick ledge.
The gas logs also cost $ 20 per month for the pilot light, whether I used it or not.
They do foul the air.
Very strong heat.
Flame looks real.
I can't believe how real it looks.
Set the tabs for remote control and heat.
No wonder the reviews are so good.
Wheel adjusts heat.
A stunner.
Lift it out of the carton and plug it in.
It overheats one room, and the others are colder.
This provides the supplemental heat I need on raw days.
Sure the gas logs put out more heat, but who needs that?
I forgot to push the tab to heat, so I only got the flame effect at first.
Take the remote out of the box, open the battery compartment, and pull out the plastic tab.Look at the back of the stove.
At this price, if I have to replace it yearly, I'll be happy.I was using ventless gas logs.

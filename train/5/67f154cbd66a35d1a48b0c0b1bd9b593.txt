It traps the odor and does an effective job.
I have been using this for years with my cat, Ricky.
Most of the time, I see the price hovering around $99... so when the price drops, you need to snag it!In regards to knock-offs...
So, six trays will last quite a while.
I went back to Fresh Step Crystals/ScoopFree litter trays and will not buy an off-brand again.I hope this review helps you make your decision.
That brand did not trap the odor and the litter smell was gross.
Great price, so I bought it.
Thank you!
One tray refill lasts about 3 weeks with him.
When it drops, I buy it.
I keep this item in my cart at all times and monitor the price.
The tray only lasted two weeks.
I tried twice another brand.
For example, on May 11, 2010 it was $85.43... which is $14.24 per tray.
I really like this product a lot.

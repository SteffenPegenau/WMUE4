strong.
she took some pictures, but not as often as i do.
id like to be able to take pictures as we ride, but with both hands on the handlebars, im not really able to do so.
we go on motorcycle trips over the place and i drive.
enter this camera strap.
nothing really to this strap.
always ready to take pics, and no danger of dropping it on the highway @ 75 mph.
thats all.
= keep it simple, stupid.i bought my girl a camera awhile ago.
K.I.S.S.
its simple.
buy one.
we just got back from a 2000 mile trip and she got some amazing shots.
i got it for her so she could have her new camera around her neck while we were riding.
put it on the camera and forget about it.

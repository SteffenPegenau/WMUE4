Ace of spades & Overkill, done just so right.
It's motorhead.
Fast Eddie among others.
Lemmy, Phil & mikkey are very electric during these songs.
That aside I like the hell out of this DVD.
The first 20 songs are prettys much the usual set list, God save the queen, You better run & broken, the exceptions.
Lighting is very good as bomber set hovers feet above band.
Accompanied by the bomber (HE 111), from thier early tours.
It's put out on a german label, will play on any machine.
There is never a bad Motorhead song, only poorly produced ones
The last, Overkill, has guest guitarists.
with surround sound, it's the next best thing to being there.
Watch on large screen tv.
These songs not recorded @ same venue as previous 20. they were shot @ european outdoor festival.
If your a true motorheadbanger, this is for you.
The last three are well worth the wait.
Bomber.
Twenty five alive, dvd.
Brian May appears also, to this day I've no idea why.

Ill be damned if he didn't look like Michael Corleone-(Godfather)!
A genius born and bred in this city!
He is talented beyond comprehension.
Loved this!
Funny Bright!
"Danny Hoch "is known all over NY.
Bless you Dan keep going-we are proud.
Also the dream sequences in the cornfield and the one with (Fat joe Dr. Dre, Danny Hoch) and what appeared to be (Mafia Traitor) Al Pacino's* own son.
But if this becomes a cult classic which is what I predict.
He should continue this into Whiteboyz 2.
Keep it going Dan.
That kid-( Eric Rivas) will blow up son!
As a matter of fact it was first film I loved Snoop Dogg in-that scene in jail was hilarious!
Smoking movie!
PS: see one of his shows live-He is mesmerizing!

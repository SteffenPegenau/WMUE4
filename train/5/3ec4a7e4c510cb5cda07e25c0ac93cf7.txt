Incredible.
Those songs were made for her to sing!
BUY IT!
Her phrasing is impeccable.
I wish I could tell her how much I have enjoyed this CD.
That voice!
Oh Ella!
Don't hesitate to buy this- you'll listen to it the rest of your life.
She is the stuff dreams are made of.
So effortless for you.
This is my all time favorite CD.
How did you do it Ella?
I just cannot express how amazing this Songbook is.
Cole Porter's lyrics pour out of her so perfectly.
I listen to all kinds of music and cannot go a day without hearing Ella sing Cole Porter.

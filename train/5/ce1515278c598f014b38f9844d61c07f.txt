I also recommend "A Little Romance" Starring Diane Lane.
At his lowest point the sweet Angel appears.
I Fell in LOVE with this movie!
If you like cute feel good movies this is for you!
This is a wonderful movie!
!
I just picked it up and thought ok I'll buy it.
I was at a store that sells discounted movies(sorry Amazon)!
If you want a good ole'feel good movie to watch on a rainy day,this is a great one!
I think this was her only film:( It starts off with Don Gregorio,a hopeless alcoholic janitor.
I just love the little actress Connie Carol.
This is a keeper also!!ENJOY!
Then he has the Devil& an Angel on his journey.
She was just a teen when she acted in the movie.
It's an older movie for sure, but It does not matter.

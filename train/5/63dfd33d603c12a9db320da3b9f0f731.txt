So I installed it!
Then started my game!
So that sucked!
They are soo cute!
I am addicted to this game!
Well if ur like me u get a ton of downloads off the internet like furniture and houses and everything!
So of corse I went out and bought this the day it came out!
So that was the only down side to it!
So I recommend this to anyone but watch out if u download stuff off the sims2.com or any other site!
!
I had alot of stuff too!
but the the stuff it gives u to make ur kids room is awesome!
Ok I love the sims 2 ALOT!
I have twins a boy and a girl and they both have different rooms with both girlie or boyish stuff!
Well it seems to wipe them from your collection of stuff!

That will drag his voice down.
American Idol production people, please leave out the background vocals and do something with the instrumentations.
I'm going to buy the single just to listen to it then I will come back to review it.
It makes no sense, however, Ruben is better without background vocals.
So, I can hear the whole cd.
Pleeeeeeeasee!
So, when his cd comes out.
I truly agree that the choir in Clay's song "Bridge over Troubled Water" should have been left out too.
My mom bought this cd, I was listening to this cd on Sunday at 1:20P.M.
Leave out the background vocals!
I love this cd, but I do not like the background vocals, they should've left him singing it alone without the background vocals.
Ruben, Clay, Kelly, and Tamyra Gray are all talented if Tamyra Gray had her cd out, it would be worth to buy.Buy this CD!!!!!
!
That's what I was expecting to hear at the end of the song.
I couldn't hear Clay's voice when they were singing.

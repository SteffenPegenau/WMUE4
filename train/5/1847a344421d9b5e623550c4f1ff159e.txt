Great toy, hope it lasts for a long time!
I bought this gym at Walmart (cheapest I found).
Overall...I am happy with this product.
I found the assembly easy.
As mentioned in a previous review, I used a heavy rubber mallet to pound stubborn pieces together.
I currently have it separated into two pieces (no tunnel connecting).
!
I only did this because I think I got two of the same pieces for the tunnel.
So she has a playhouse with a door and a climber with 2 slides.
I am currently awaiting a return email from Little Tikes on how to handle this.
Hopefully they will just send me the right piece.
My daughter is 14 months going on 3 years.
She's a daredevil and a heck of a climber already.
This gym is a hassle to haul home...you need a truck.
So far it's a hit.
In all, I had it together by myself in less than 45min.

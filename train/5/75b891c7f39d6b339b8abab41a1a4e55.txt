I only wish I had known about it sooner.
I just throw in my Diva cup.
It takes some practice inserting, but once you've got that down you are good to go.
As far as I am concerned, the menstrual cup is the only way to go.
I completely forget it is even there.
When I go on vacation I don't have to pack a suitcase full of disposable stuff.
The Diva cup keeps you clean and comfortable and free.
My period is no longer a big deal.
You can also boil it to make sure it is all clean at the end of each cycle.
I recommend it to everyone.
It is not associated with toxic shock syndrome which is a huge plus.
It has saved me so much money and hassle over the years because it is reusable.
Do yourself a favor and start using it now.
It has completely changed my life.
You can wear it for up to 12 hours with no problems whatsoever.
It is much more sanitary than a pad and much safer/more comfortable/longer lasting/cleaner than a tampon.

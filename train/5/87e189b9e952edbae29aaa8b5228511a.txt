Elegant, poignant, powerful.
Thank you, Melissa, for a remarkable work of true honesty, transparency, and insight.
Captivating.
An awesome CD.
The pain is real as is the commitment to her own survival.However, this album does not fall into the easy trap of bitterness, pointless anger, self-hatred or blaming others.
It so beautifully captures the pain of a breakup and the move toward healing.
And there is another side.
Compelling.
Superbly moving.
Melissa finds herself and reclaims her right to passion and love in "I Want To Be In Love".
Lyrically enthralling.
"Heal Me" is an incredible anthem, a statement of hope and promise.I'm a therapist, and I have used songs from this album with my clients, especially those going through marital changes or healing from sexual abuse.
You inspire me.
This applies though, not just to a relationship problem, but any healing journey.
It searches through the wreckage and slogs through pain to get to the other side.

Good stuff, this.
waxing philosophic?
HRSA and Drop gives me goosebumps, and Breakfast after 10, my introduction to them, is very solid.
serious?
Track 2,(Independantly Happy) however, i love.
(And, if you are, fear not, someone else will probably buy it from you.)
Just damn good, and solid- hell, that's the whole album.
Still not too sure what to make of the opening track: comic?
Check these guys out, chances are you won't be dissappointed.
That's the best word i can figure for that one.
all of the above?
The whole album is worth listening to--go ahead and just leave in the cd player for a long while.
Desparation creates a unique sense of humour.
The lyrics tend to be more melancholy than not, if that's your bag, great; the music, however, regardless, is certainly worth noting.
I only recently stumbled rather unwittingly into this band, and well, whaddayaknow, i like this.

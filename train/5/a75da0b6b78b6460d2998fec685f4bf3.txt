I'm an 8.5 women's size street shoe, and this fits me PERFECTLY!
Rainbow is such a great company!!!!
No hassle at all!
They replaced them!
If you have ANY problems with them contact Rainbow.
I do recommend you know your size first.
I've had three pairs.
Also, the womens' sizes are a bit narrower and my foot spilled over the sandal.
My daughter had a pair that was getting really worn out after a few years of wear.
I personally prefer the wide straps.
I can't say enough!
I am hard on shoes especially if I love them.
I've worn flip flop sandals for years and never come across a brand as good as these!
The men's is a bit wider.
How cool is that???
My husband wears them.
I first had the women's fine straps and they wore out a little more quickly.
This last pair I got was a men's small.
They are soooo helpful and courteous!

Her long, red hair goes perfectly with the sea-green of her outfit.
Maybe a little at the end, but what I'm really looking to do is to SHUT EVERYBODY UP.
The zebra print is a perfect accessory!!
YOU CAN'T ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING WORTHWHILE!
!
!Back to the doll: I love her!!
SHUT UP!
NO ONE CARES.
I have seen you people on every item that I review, and I'm ashamed I have to say this in a review where you're supposed to talk about the doll, but someone has to stop you.
SHUT UP ALREADY!!!
I like myscene and bratz, but I don't bash them or say anything to people that do bash them.
I love it all!!
I think the skirt has a little ballerina effect, don't you?
What are you trying to do??????
I know you people are going to bash me cause of this or whatever, but this "war" is interfering with people ACCUALLY trying to find out about the stupid doll!

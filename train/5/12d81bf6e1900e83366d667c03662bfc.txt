Tak is a phenom.Michael Rhode's bass playing is not to be missed.
What a pairing.
New material.
This guy has taste, touch and class.
Loved The Larry Carlton/Steve Lukather DVD.But sometimes, even with great artists, one DVD may still be enough to get the main idea of what they have to offer/say.
If I had to choose though, this DVD is tops.
Larry and a four piece horn section.
Perfect.
Doesn't seem to be the case with Larry.This DVD is absolutely phenomenal.
But don't choose.Please don't peg me as a Larry freak, I just love great concert DVDs.
This is not Larry and an up and coming shredder.
Who put these guys together?
Again, not more of the same.
Great drumming and keyboard, John Ferraro & Billy Steinway.If you have some Larry Carlton, this is "NOT" more of the same.Great, great material....and new.Also, Larry's Saphire Blues Band DVD is not to be missed either.
Tak is one of the best guitarist you'll ever see.

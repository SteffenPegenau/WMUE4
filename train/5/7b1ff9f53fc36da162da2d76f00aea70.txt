You know how some books are difficult to read aloud?
I literally have this book memorized.
This book never gets old.
TIMES.
I could recite it right now without missing a word because I've read it SO.
It was my favorite book as a kid, and when my mother-in-law gave me a copy that belonged to my husband when he was a boy, I was thrilled.
You know how the rhymes aren't quite right, and the meter is off?

Truly a classic!

to my kids.
It can be read aloud with ease.
MANY.
My kids love it, and so do I.
Plus, the story is truly entertaining for an imaginative child.

Listen to Tempus Fugit completely and you will see.
I highly recommend this CD to anyone.
Virgil must be a Yes fan because he remixes parts we know so well while maintaining the beautiful parts in Awaken, and the riffs that have made Yes legendary.
And the tribute "No Clowns" which is actually an overview of all of Yes' kicking songs, is excellent.
Great!
It is Yes music but Virgil respectfully interplays all the parts while maintaining his own artist fervor.
First, to enjoy this Remix album you must be a diehard Yes fan or very much into a Moby dance remix style.
You have a new fan!!
Every song is a familiar surprise!!
!My best to Virgil!!!
Bass riffs in "Heart of the Sunrise" are well preserved and remixed.
Bravo Virgil!
!
I know Yes music so well that it is refreshing to hear my favorite group's songs redone with grace and integrity.
The piano in Awaken is somehow just as beautiful as the original.

Nobody.
Who can play that jungle beat like Brad?
"Anything" rules!
Who else can play guitar like Kevin?
Everyone must bow to them becuase they are just so awesome.
I go to every concert of theirs I can because they kick @ss!
Who can rock out on bass like Arion?
Third Eye Blind= THE BEST F'N BAND IN THE WORLD!
Everyone get Blue!
Not one person.

And who can sing, liven the crowd, and write wicked cool lyrics like Stephan?

Not a soul!

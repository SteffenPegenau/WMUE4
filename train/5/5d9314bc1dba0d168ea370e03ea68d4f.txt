This book really helps you understand the scales and the relationships between them.
I like how Troy starts simple by starting with the Minor Pentatonic scales and building from there.
It is nice that he also give the scales in different case to help contrast them.
With this book I really get it now.
I have seen a lot of books on scales.
This one is hands down the best.
Oh and the explanation on modes is brilliant.
Wow, I have been playing guitar for over 25 years.
This book is great as a reference book or as a method book.
I can not say enough for this book.
This book Rocks!
Troy is a very good teacher.
This little $5.95 book has more info on scales than any of the books that cost 3 times that amount.
The only critisism I can give is that I wish it would relate the chords to the scales better or at least give the basic chords that go along with each scale.
I never was able to really grasp the concept even after having two different guitar teachers try to explain them.

Av went on to better things such as Frank Sintra.
Frank's love for Ava pushed him over the edge he even tried to end his life over this lady.
Its a juicey book from stard to finsh.
Honest.
!
Wow what a good job Lee did on this one.
I have read this book 2 times and will read it again and again!!
At least he was a real man.
Ava had the life Ave travled the world got to shag lots sexy men.
Hes ugly and small.
Ava knew how to party she wasn't spending her life in her room watching the episodes of the golden girls like someone I knew.
In some ways you have to pat Ava on the back she got her cherry poped by Andy Ronney how horrible that must be for the girl.
Ava Gardner fans you won't get bored form reading this book.
Peace Out!!
He really went out his way to make a touching book about Ava.

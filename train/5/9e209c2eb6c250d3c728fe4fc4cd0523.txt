I did get a few phone calls from back home (Savannah) asking me if I had anything to do with this film inasmuch as I am known for having the gift, myself.
If you saw Midnight In The Garden, you are already aware of the 'other' presence there of magic, obeah and other supernatural events.
Enjoyable movie to watch on a rainy weekend night.
I really like this guy enormously.
Ms. Blanchett shines as the gal with the gift.
This movie was made in Savannah, Ga.
He gives 1000 percent in every performance.
But I did very much enjoy watching the film and understanding how difficult it is to be special in a small city.
I won't give the ending away but you will be surprised.
Seeing Katie Holmes topless was rather a shock, but this was before Tom came on the scene.
While the story is very over the top, all of the people depicted are right on.
Nope.
Greg Kinnear gives a low-key, endearing but really honest performance.
Not a thing.
Ribisi is just incredible in this film.

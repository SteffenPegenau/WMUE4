I felt for these girls and in the process found myself falling in love with their characters.
We can all use a good friend like Lisa and Celeste in our lives.
This was hands down the best book I have read in years.
Only very few of us are lucky enough to truly capture it.
With each chapter reeling me in I couldn't put it down.
It has truly changed a part of me.
I laughed, I cried(sometimes at the same time).
I would reccommend it to any one contemplating the purchase.
These girls were gifted and way ahead of their time.
It really made me re-examine my entire adolescence.
This book truly consumed me!
It pains me, that they felt the need to travel down the roads they did, but then again that's apart of life we often have to lose ourselves in order to be found.
They shared a bond that ran deeper than blood itself.
Never before in my life has a book had the ability to move me in such a way.From the very begining I had an idea of what to expect.
BUY IT!

If anyone makes a mistake as final answer, you can let it go, or use the following "wrong answer" track.
Please!
Get this CD.
The sounds are still great!
Come on!
It has all 74 amazing tracks from the television (or should I say "tellie") show!
I personally like the lifeline sounds the best, but hey, you're taking advice from a 12 year old.
The UK version is just as awesome!
Will you get it?
Just keep on talking!
I know, you all want the US version and blah blah blah.
2 bonus tracks remixed from the show's Theme.
With currency printed on the track listing, who cares?
You've heard Regis Philbin (or Chris Tarrant) from the show, but now YOU'RE hosting.
You call the shots.
What do you say?

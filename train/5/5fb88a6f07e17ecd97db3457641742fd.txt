I wish there was a discount for buying more than one set because I would have for our second home!
I'll need to research how to do this.Anyway, the quality of the Classic set (as this is one of the higher rated models compare to other Wusthof models) is superb!
I had my eye on a larger knife set but kept putting it off due to the money.
I'm not sure how I can exchange just 1 knife out of the set.
The knives cut whole watermelons & butternut squash like butter!
They handle extrenely well and have a great sturdy grip.
I think I damaged the point in doing so.
These are a keepsake which can be passed down in your family!
I absolutely love them!
After much research, I bought a couple of Wusthof Classic knives last year.
I can't survive with returning the entire set and wait for a replacement.
It is worth every penny and the storage unit is a must!
I couldn't see spending that much money for knives.
Well, I was wrong!
You can't leave the knives in your dishrack to dry.

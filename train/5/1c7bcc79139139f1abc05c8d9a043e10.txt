This toy is perfect.
I used a clicker to get our litter-mate shelie puppies (2x8 months) to fetch.
I bought it at 7 months once they had fetch with balls.
creates havoc in our house thanks to this toy.
yet this tough, but pliable canvas construction gives enough when they chew that it has not torn.
5 stars because I can't go higher.
Oh - and these dogs eat everything!!!!
They picked it up at about 4 months.
Simply perfect.
"Fetch" or "where is it?"
Buy it.
I alternate between this toy and "Chuck-it" hard rubber balls to play with them.
Before I bought this and the Chuck It ball, they would great me at the door with tail wags and dances after work.
Let me put it this way.
Now, when I come home after work, they bark once or twice and do not come to me, but instead go to the back door to go outside and play fetch.

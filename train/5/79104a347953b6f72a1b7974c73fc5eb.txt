This movie is really impressive.
I had never even heard of Farscape until this miniseries was released.
In fact, I didn't even have a satellite dish during the show's run.
I understood the whole thing.
I was hooked.
But it's really not that important.
It's a least worth a rental to the uninitiated sci-fi fan.
But when I sat up late one night, around eleven, I caught an encore of PART ONE of THE PEACEKEEPER WARS.
I liked it anyway.
A couple parts might be inappropriate for younger viewers.
I never saw one episode.
Oh, I'm sure the richness and the love for the characters would be stronger had I seen the previous episodes.
I was dissapointed with a few coy remarks.
The plot is really detailed, but you'll get into it if you open your mind.
Other than that, it's good, fun entertainment.
Give it a try.

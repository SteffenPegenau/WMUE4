I think it's awesome and everyone should definately get it!
So i don't get why there were so many people that didn't like it!
it's acapella and it sounds amazing!
this cd is amazing!!
And she did a really great job of it!
Keep that amazing music coming!
i love it!
:)i was really dissapointed with all the negative reviews i read about this album!
she just keeps getting better and better!Sure this one is different from her other 2, but isn't that what makes it so great??
you can't keep doing the same thing forever.. it'll get boring after a while.
:)There are soo many fantastic songs on here.. the voice inside, love is my witness, dizzy, double agent..etc.. And inside the tornado is really cool!
I have all her albums and they are so good!!
I would love to hear more like that!
!Amanda you rock!!
So i think it's awesome that she wanted to try out something new!
It's not bad at all!

They all look great.As far as too much DNR and people looking waxy.
Well, they have a ton of make up caked on there faces.
I still see facial detail, clothing, etc.Also, people commented on things being out of focus, not sharp.
Well worth the money.
The motion picture has never looked so good.
People need to know the differance.
A HUGE step up from the dvd set that I also own.
This is the oldest of the films and I am very impressed with how good it looks.
I think the cameras used have a very short focus length.
This has nothing to do with the restoration, it was how it was filmed originally.Over all I am VERY happy with this set and it is a GREAT deal!
I think these movies look GREAT on Blu ray.
I've watched all 6 movies and the bonus disc.
These are not the youngest of actors in these movies.
This is a review from someone who actually owns this set.
So if someone is not the focus of a scene, they are not in focus.

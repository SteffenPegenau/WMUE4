This album is really spectacular.
Jimmy excels on Angel Eyes and Somebody to Watch over Me.
They were the only guests that showed up.
GET THE ALBUM!
!
The tiny man with a voice to shame Gabriel's trumpet sent shivers down my spine.
(He appears on Magic and Loss by Reed).
I didn't catch his name at the time and always wondered who he was.
"Sycamore Trees" is the best Jimmy Scott I have EVER heard.
Innocent and pure and able to tear your serenity to shreds.
Then I finally watched the Twin Peaks series on video.
What can I say?
His voice absolutely has to be heard to be believed.
I first saw him during the L.A. riots on the Aresenio Hall show singing backup for Lou Reed.
For any Scott fan who does not own "Twin Peaks -- Fire Walk With Me" YOU MUST BUY IT!!!

If you are looking for action and adventure I would suggest this game ages 8 & up.
I love this game and I'm not even a fan!
I LUV THIS GAME!
I don't even have the game!
such as springs robots sand lava etc.
U have about 13 levels and bosses in each.
Nuckles is my favorite because he can swim climb and glide!
I defently give this Game 5 stars!
I couldn't play a better a better game!
Each level has 2 acts.
I just played with it with my friend and I fell in love with it!
Amy is the weakest but she is still good.
Each level has tons of obstacles that can help you and hurt you.
When I see people who doesn't like it I think whats up with them!
Sonic can slide on rails.
She can only run at normal speed while the others have super powers so they have extra speed but she can jump really high.
Tails can fly.

Easier to hold, has some extra buttstock length.
Don't get me wrong.
Otherwise, it is too tight and the round will not feed or eject properly.
not sure why others say its nice.
This is so much better when comparing to the wood or wood laminate stocks.
It is lighter.
The Monte Carlo stock is nice.
Recoil is better, the checkered pattern is nice for grip, and things are in the right places.
The cheek rest is a joke.
sits better.
It will do, but only because it comes built into the mold.
I bought 2 and had to modify the heck out of both of them.
I give it 5 stars because it is a day and night difference.
Not a ton of work to do to update the rifle about 60 years.
With a lot of grinding and sanding it fit great.

Incidently, he was able to fix the wheel on the old one, so now we've got a spare.
My father (who will be 105 next week) started using this model a few years ago.
I'm going to donate it to a local charity thrift store.
It was quickly apparent that this was not going to work for him.
The "feel" was flimsy and he couldn't carry a glass of water to his chair in the floppy basket.
All they had were ones with small wheels and a "floppy" basket.
We got this model from Walgreens.
It's perfect.
Then a wheel snapped off.
He insisted he could fix it, but I went to Walgreens to buy one he could use until then.
Highly recommended.
The flimsy one?
(And the price wasn't that much more than the flimsy one.)
He really used it, as he still has projects he works on out in his shop, so he went back and forth frequently.
I got on-line and found this -- an apparent match to the older one.
Sturdy, big wheels, wire basket.

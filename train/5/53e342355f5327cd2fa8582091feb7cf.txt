It is incredible to think of Greek armies in the monsoons of the tropics!
There are downsides, though.
I would have preferred to have more, and in greater detail.
In the first episode we are in Greece; in the last episode we have reached India.
Just a brief sweep of the landscape would have been enough.
I would have preferred more panoramic views.
It is rather dissatifying to see the place of the Battle of Issus, without having time to actually look at the place.
My favourite episode is number 3, where the landscape gets more and more alien as time goes on.
They still remember Alexander's conquest!
One of my favourite parts is where Michael Wood is talking to nomad horsemen in Central Asia.
Also, the amount of detail is uneven.
Michael Wood's documentary is astounding.
What a journey.
Only two battles were covered in any depth.
It would have been more exciting to the viewer.

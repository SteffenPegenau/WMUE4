It's too short.
This album is great.
I think there could've been a few more songs included on the album.
I like Lil' Kim alot more though.
Nonetheless, Ill Na Na is a classic!
I first discovered her in the "touch me tease me" video by Case.
But Foxy's almost just as good too which she proves in this album.
This album is one of my favorite rap albums!
I thought she was so cool!
Best songs are "Get Me Home," "If I Could," "Rock The Bells," and "No One's Gonna" don't hesitate to get this album if you don't already own it!!
!
She's an intelligent lady and one hell of a rapper.
I love foxy brown.
she doesn't disappoint!
But it could've been better if there weren't so many guest rappers.

Now the actual cleaning solution doesn't get the job done with ANY extractor in my opinion.
Recently, my cat became deathly ill.
I don't recommend this to you, because it will make your warranty invalid.
My dog comes in from the back yard on rainy days and tracks mud inside the house.
The carpet takes a beating and I can wait a week and then spot clean.
I used an entire tank and it took some time, but the end result was VERY satisfactory.
However, I think adding a tablespoon of detergent (LIQUID!!)
My carpet is brand new and I was worried.
and hot water works VERY well.
I discovered some really bad excretions that must have sat over a month behind a sofa in a room I rarely enter.
Anything over a tablespoon or two will cause a sudsy overflow and clog the system.
I have had this item for a little over a month.
I prefer to add a little liquid laundry detergent.
That's a light weight job.
This extractor got it right out.

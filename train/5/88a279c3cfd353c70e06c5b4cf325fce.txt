Out of all my pendulum books this is gonna be my favorite!
It is all that and more!
!
Other than that miniscule problem...
I think their introduction said it best.
The overall design of the charts are visually inspiring and beautiful!
But, of course, that doesn't mean that you couldn't benefit from researching that in other pendulum books."
My only small complaint is I wish when these designers design pendulum books with charts they would plan to make them spiral bound so they lay flat.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE WORKING WITH IT!!!
The instructions are brief and to the point.
Instead of long-winded explanations, you'll get precise visual commentaries.
"This book supplies practical material that makes working with the pendulum easier.
It's not the purpose of this book to enter deeply into the philosophy of swinging the pendulum, nor to explore the energies that are behind it.
The best charts I've ever seen in a pendulum book!
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!!

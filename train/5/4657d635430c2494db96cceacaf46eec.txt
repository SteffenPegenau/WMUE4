I purchased mine at the Sony Outlet store.
I have been waiting for 6-9 months for prices to drop.They finally did.
$499.00 at Amazon.
This is a dying or dead technology and it is a shame.
I hooked up the DVR with optical audio to the Sony system.All worked very well and the sound is amazing.
Surround sound adds so much to a HDTV.
It is outstanding.
Assembly of the speakers took a little time but once completethe system filled my room with sound.
This takes a little time but worth the wait.
If you get this system a great place to buy SACDs is Amazon.com.
I have tried DVD, HDTV, and CDs and all sounded great.
Try Saving private Ryanin surround sound.
Try a SACD audio disk and the sound is absolutely incredible.
At $499.00 this is a great value.
One big surprise is SACD.
All and all a great system.
I have 55" WEGA HD Sony TV and COXDVR.
The loading of the DVD is slow.
It has a 5 CD holder and they are stacked so like an elevator it has to go up and down as you change disks.

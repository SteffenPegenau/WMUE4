I love her OOPS I DID IT AGAIN CD.
I just love the songs, Stronger, Lucky, One Kiss From You, Don't let me be the last to know, when your eyes say it, and where are you now.
And I still am today!
Anyways, back to the CD.
And Britney is a great singer, I found that out and I also found that she has great dance moves by watching her pepsi commercial(s).
I've only been a fan of Britney since Baby One More Time, 99.
Except for her fans are the only ones who like her.
I'm trying to get into other singers' music, cos I'm tired of hearing the same Celine music everyday.
:-) hehe.
I don't see why ppl have to be so mean to Britney!!
So... if you like good POP music, then I suggest you buy Britney's release of Oops..!
Even my mom, doesn't like her cos of the way she dresses,bla bla doesn't matter to me, I like the way she dresses.
Although nobody likes her at my school, and hardly no one else in this world.
She has 3 pepsi commercials...!
I Did It Again.
Like ME!

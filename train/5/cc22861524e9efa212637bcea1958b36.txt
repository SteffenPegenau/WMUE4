Lorgin too.
I liked this book.
Because what would have happened if the stone was in the wrong hands?
It was different and if it is like Star Track, more power to the author because I never cared for those movies.
The stone and everything after that.
The sex scenes sizzle.
The book is about his magical journey.
The whole book is the magical quest, an FYI to those who missed that.
Ya, Deana was a dunce at times, but I thought overall she made a good character.
It is a fun adventure to new places and all kinds of "people"
It is him in the tunnel, when he came out and why.
It is an interesting adventure that's for sure.
I liked the journey that we were brought on.
I would reccomend this book.
The different worlds the author creates and the alien life forms.
Those who read the book will know what I mean.

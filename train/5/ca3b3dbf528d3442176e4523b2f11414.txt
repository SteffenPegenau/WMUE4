Ill let you find out what they are.
This game is amazing.
When i played the demo it was amazing.
What i think the best part about TimeShift is the online multiplayer.
The storyline may be a bit confusing but you can try to do it or go online and find a walkthrough.
You can have 2-16 players in a game.
Its what you would expect from a next generation game.
I knew i had to have the game.
I would definitly suggest adding this game to your cart.
You can freeze time, rewind time, or slow it down for about 3-4 seconds.
Then the graphics are great as well.
I recommend this game for xbox 360 or play station 3 either one is sick-nasty.
The first person shooter is unbelivable in this game.
The possibilities are endless in multiplayer.
Im still finding new stuff in it.
The guns are amazing.
I think that this is the second best game for xbox 360 besides Halo 3.

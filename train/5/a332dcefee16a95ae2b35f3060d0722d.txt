We both agree that it was an outstanding novel.
I enjoyed it so much I bought three copies, for my friends and mother.
I believe that the friendship Pat, Gayle and Marcus had was one in which if everyone had or experienced, this world would be a better place.
It was so had to put the book down.
TTS was recommended to me by my good friend Rod.
I appreciated all three characters.
I found it to be Excellent writing (An Outstanding Story).
I enjoyed reading Tryin to Sleep.
If the second book is anything like TTS, I know it will also be a best seller.
Tryin to Sleep is a novel that felt very real.
I look forward to and can't wait to read it.
I'm sure you ladies are writing your next book as we speak.
In closing I would like to say, This is one of the best books I've read thus far.
Congratulations on an Excellent book.
Do you think there could be a sequel?

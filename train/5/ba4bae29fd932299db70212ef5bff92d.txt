I so wish the songs were longer.
Surreal = bizarre or dreamlike.Get your boots on, strap in and take off on a Violet Journey with the amazing Orianthi.
After seeing her shred a PRS on the 2009 Grammys as Carrie Underwood's lead axe I knew there was something special about this girl.
.
.
.let's say woman.
Catch her on YouTube performing with Santana and other great guitarists.
.
outstanding is one adjective I can think of.
I'm sure others are as well.
I enjoy every song on this CD.
I am highly anticipating her US debut in 2009.
phenomenal is the other.
Violet Journey encapsulates a few months in 2005 of Orianthi off in her own little world recording this Aussie debut.

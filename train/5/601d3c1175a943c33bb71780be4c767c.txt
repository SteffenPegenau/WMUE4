Cotillion is my favorite of many favorites.
and I find my collection is musty smelling and the bindings decaying.

My college roommate introduced me to Goergette Heyer in the last semester of my senior year.
So, so I can share them with my granddaughters (the ones I hope to have years from now), I will be building my collection of Georgettes in hardback as I can.
That was 30 years ago and I collected all her Regencies in paperback and reread them all every few years.
Now I have a fourteen year old daughter to whom I am introducing these most witty and well written of books.
.Thank you, Amazon.com., for making that a possiblity for me.
Georgette is great.

I still remember when I got to the point I was rooting for Freddy.
.and somehow I managed to graduate anyway.
.and feeling guilty about it becasue he was NOT the proper hero of a Regency book.

I want to use it all the time.
Also I chose the cheapest shipping method (free with housewares purchase) and it arrived in about 2 days all my items together.
I do not have a lot of time for myself.
My dentist recomended this one.
I really wanted one that spinned.
I just couldn't get myself to pay that much for it.
I did have them cleaned the day this arrived.
I got it out when it arrived and have loved it.
I bought this with a gift certificate my company gave me.
The first try doesn't hurt like the other reviews would have you think it just tickles.
(a plus with the free shipping) I have checked around and the 2 pack replacement heads are cheaper online than at a store.
I had been wanting an electric toothbrush for over a year.
I will make the time because my teeth feel so clean when I am finished.
I have a teenager and a two year old.
If you have been thinking about one look at all the reviews this is the only brush that consistantly gets a 5 star.

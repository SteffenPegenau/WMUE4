Seering rockers ("Rocks Off, All Down The Line); Gospel-tinged ("Shine A Light"); R&B ("Tumblin' Dice).
And of course the signature Keith with "Happy".
All the myths are lived through this one release.
This album defines the cliche' "sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll".
Stones at their best.
A-Z, dirty rock music the way God planned it.
A completely honest album.
Highly, highly underrated album.
Great acoustic country campfire numbers ("Sweet Virginia", "Torn & Frayed").
Overdubs at the kitchen table.
Sounds like a bunch of friends got together and turned on the tape recorder.
18 beautiful tracks.
People talking in the background.
Recorded in the basement of Keith Richards' house in France, it has a shoddy production and care-free arrangements.
Just as it was intended.

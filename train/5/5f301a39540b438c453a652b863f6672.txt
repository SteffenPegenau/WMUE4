It's so much more of a better deal, too.
Boozer, Kirilenko, Arroyo, and Harpring are going to bring a title to Utah.
If you buy this game you will not be dissapointed.Jazz #1
Streetball, tournaments, 21, and 24/7 mode are all classic.
This game has NBA Live 2005 beat by a mile.
Walton is awesome.
Bill Walton is the analyst and he does a great job.
I couldn't put the controller down.
All the rosters are current as well, so I can beat up on the competition with my Utah Jazz.
The graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is even better.
Anyway, this game is non stop fun.
This game has everything you could want in a basketball game.
Ben Wallace is on the cover, a good sign that this game was going to be something special.
And it's only $15!
Man, ESPN NBA 2K5 is an awesome game!

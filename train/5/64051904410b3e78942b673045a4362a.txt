I purchased this keyboard when it first came out so many years ago.
Having also been an instructor I introduced many students to this keyboard.
I have been working in the field for 35 years and have gone through many versions of keyboards.
Old and tired eyes like mine find it much harder to use.
I also prefer to use low lighting in my office.
Usually this is determined in the first 15 mins of using it.
The lighter color is much easier to use.
I do not know why everything is done in black these days.
I have found either people love it or hate it.
My wrists have greatly appreciated it.I truly miss the white (ish) colored devices.
I have gone through about 4 of these keyboards over the years.
I wish they would bring that back like these.
As mentioned either you love it or hate it.
I use it both at work and at home, and at my friends if I can talk them into it.
This design has been the best for me.

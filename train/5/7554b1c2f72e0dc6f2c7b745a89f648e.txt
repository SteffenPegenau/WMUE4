Each song is too great for words to do it justice.
The music was just perfect, and I went right out and got Black Holes and Revelations and Absolution.
The lyrics on the album are some of the most lush and romantic ever sang.
Then, forget it, Absolution is my favorite Muse album.
I was expecting the usual opening band crapfest, and instead got MUSE!
I discovered Muse when they opened for My Chemical Romance in Nashville in April 2007.
Then Sing for Absolution became my favorite song.
Then Stockholm Syndrome.
Then it was Small Print.
Honestly, this is one of the best.
I dare you!
Just get it and listen for yourself.
How blessed am I?
Just TRY to get Time is Running Out out of your brain!
Initially, I liked BHaR the better of the two, but Time is Running Out just stuck in my brain.

Mia Thermopolis was nothing untill she found out she was a princess.
Not only that but she has a big crush on the most popular guy in school.
Really the only reason her crush asked her out was to get some publicity.
Of course Mia says yes.
Nothing could be worse for Princess Mia.
When the reporters show up her crush ends up kissing Mia infront of everyone and Mia is hummiliated.
How will she deal with it all being a tall flat chested unpopular girl in the 9th grade who is failing algebra.
Her mom also starts going out with her teacher.
He asks her to the dance.
It may be a small country but thats still a whole country.
Then a bunch of reporters start taking pictures of the princess.
That is Princess of a whole country.
Her grandmother is nothing but a witch who thinks Mia should act like a princess.
He is tall dark and hansom.
She has never kissed anyone.

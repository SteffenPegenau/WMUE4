Yes, I am a fan of Limp Bizkit and KoRn.
But if you're smart, you'll give it a listen.
If you like complaining, you'll complain about this album.
It's still a rockin' album, and that is all that needs to be said.
And most importantly, yes, I LOVE THIS ALBUM!
You'll say that they've changed.
Evolve, stay fresh, and most of all not get boring.
And that is, yes, I am a sellout.
And yes, I bought it at a MAJOR CHAIN record store!
This is the first "emo" album I've ever bought.
Sure, it's not innovative musically, and yes, it's unbelievably catchy.
If you like music, you'll like this album.
And the Get Up Kids are far from boring.
So what?
but, I feel I must comment on something more important.
I'll agree, because that's what a band is supposed to do.
Now, I know what you maladjusted, ready-to-turn-on-your-band- as-soon-as-some- "trendy" -kid-likes-them morons will say: This isn't half as good as (insert early to mid '90s release here).

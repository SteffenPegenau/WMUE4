There was always something to look forward to and you always wanted to know where it would lead.
.Its a classic (like LOTR), and for good reason (it was very inventive), so treat yourself to it.
.
Heck there were even good lessons in this book.
then it was great.

I would have to say this is a great series started with a fantastic book.
Not many stories do that, and sometimes the ones that do don't do it realistically.The story was really good as well.
whatever you want to call it (boring prose?).
Read them to find out, as I don't want to spoil ANYTHING.
They learn lessons in life and are changed by it, and you can especially see this in reading the later books.
The writing was great in my opinion, sometime Ursula went off on tangents that I found incredibly boring, but when she stuck to her story and didn't try to do.
Its great!
.
I love the characters in this book; they are so interesting and different that you'll find yourself really drawn to them.

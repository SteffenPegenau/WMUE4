WOW!!!
Maybe my Faith is not big enough.... Can theirs be?
I was almost sure not so!
But?
Noah Standing Bear and Anne Lundstrom don't seem to have a prayer of making it over so many obstacles in their way but can they do it?
Read it so you will find the joy and happiness Ms. Warren brings into our hearts and makes them sing.
I loved Susan May Warren's first DEEP HAVEN,1 HAPPILY EVER AFTER but now?
As well as the influence God plays in this romantic novel?
the second of the series DEEP HAVEN,2?
TYING THE KNOT?
Loved it!
These characters are just as sweet and intriguing.
How do you do it, Ms. Warren?
I can't wait for DEEP HAVEN,3 to come out!
Thank you Ms. Warren for writing once again a page turner for us!

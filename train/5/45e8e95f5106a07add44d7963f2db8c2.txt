Look what it has to offer.
Take a look at the complete tracklisting.
Over 30 rare songs, and new songs.The best by far is "We've Had Enough".
I mean, this "Coldjustice" reviewer comes on everyday, either to add to a review, or post a new one.
Also, what's sad is that people come on to mark reviews as "not helpful".Another example: On the first page or so, they came back to add to a review in response to another fan.
The fans outnumber the sad haters.
There are more rare songs, than repackaged songs.
How sad.This album on the other hand, is not a rip off.
If their life is based on bashing a legend, then how low can they get?Obviously, they have nothing else to do.
So, we minus well ignore them.
"Fall Again" was promoted by VH1, as it is a beautiful slow song.
This review was helpful.
Its not a complitation repackaged again.
Isn't it funny how sometimes...people don't have a life.
And remember: THIS REVIEW WAS HELPFUL.

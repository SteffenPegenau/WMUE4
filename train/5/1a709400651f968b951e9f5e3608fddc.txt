Twenty plus years ago I read Clarence's column in M&F.
I'll pass on to you what he said to me "Get Ripped."
But realize that Clarence, like all writers, except me for now, only has so much gas in his tank.
Years later I had all that he had written.
One of the books I bought directly from him was autographed by Clarence.
It was so impressing and inspirational I bought this book.
Then I finally became a vice-president, no time for serious working out, etc.
His last couple of works lack the meat of his earlier works, but so what.
Amazon has done it again!
These are the best available, bar none.
His books went in garage sales and such.
Now that I've retired it's time for me again.
I've given them a well deserved five star rating.
After a few hundred dollars and many new ideas, I wondered if Clarence Bass books might just be available used or what ever.
They're all here, and new, no less.

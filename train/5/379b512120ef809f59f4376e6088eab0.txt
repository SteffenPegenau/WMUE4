I once owned a gas blower which did fine for a couple years.
I'll own a Toro Super Blower the rest of my life if they continue building it.
Plus you have a vacuum to clean leaves out of your shrubs!
5 STARS!!!
!
Used it another year or so and the engine froze up.
Garbage.
I'll never own another gas blower after buying this Toro Super Blower.
Low speed helps control gathering while high speed is super strong.
The knock on electric blowers is having to deal with the extension cord, but I'd rather have that to deal with than the mixing of the fuel and hard starting problems associated with gas blowers.
I questioned some of the changes to this model at first, but after using it for the past couple years, I love it!
Great product!!!
Had to have it repaired.
I had owned the prior model which was fantastic, lasted for years and years.
(I tried to change it from the 3 stars and couldn't)The Toro Super Blower is a super product.
Then the hard starting began.

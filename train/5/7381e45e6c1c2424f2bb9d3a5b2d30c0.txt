Stanely is so cute.
I don't have the DVD but if Ravens in it then i totally recomend it.
Also Chelsea is soooooooooo hilarious.
Sorry got a bit carried away.
also the one with......Oh there is no time to say them all, it would take a million years!
I think That's so Raven is the best show in the history of television and anyone who says it's not is totally stupid!Who cares if Ravens dad is a producer or whatever.
!
I think the whole cast and crew are amazin and i thank them for bringing me television joy!
My favourite episodes are:the one where all the pupils are trying to impress someone they think is from undercover superstar and everyone is singing.
I loved Chelseas song the best!
THATS SO RAVEN TOTALLY ROCKS!!!
Also the episode with little Stanely handcuffs Raven to him and they both sing in the Chill Grill!
"all alone in the hallways as always, just the stairwell the lockers and me".
Raven got that part cos she's the best actress EVER!
So is Eddie.

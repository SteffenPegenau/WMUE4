HOTTIE!!
Zombieland is tied with this one!
In this movie Achilles actually chops off the statue of Apollo's head... but..yeah.
When he filmed this I FREAKED out!
Brad Pitt plays a demi-god in this movie!
He is shirtless for like half of the movie!!
When I heard he was 40!!!
It actually inspired the names of 2 of my pets.
Yeah well, its really a good movie for teenage girls (Brad Pitt) and teenage guys (all the fighting).
Achilles and Apollo.
=) Just another reason to love it!
I LOVE action and ESPECIALLY Greek war movies.
!
This movie is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITES.
Once again one of my favorites!!

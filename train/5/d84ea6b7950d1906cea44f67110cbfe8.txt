I cried at the ending of this Season.
I have always loved the ALIAS Television series.
Arguments between lovers are so real and the times where you see then together are done really well.
I hadn't seen anything yet!
Jealousy goes between both when "Pretend" love is given for missions.
It ends with a tear-jerker to me.
The story of Michael(Dupuis) and Nikita(Wilson) is amazing.
I was attached to it.
I watched the series for threee days staraight becuase it kept me hooked.
Purchasing this is not a waste of money.
I had always wanted to see a series where two of the main characters have fallen in love and have fought and not told one another.
When I purchsed La Femme Nikita and watched it, not only was Roy Dupuis hot, but the story of the section and Nikita's life was awesome.
I have now watched it so much I have fallen in love with this series.
People get shot and injured.
(Watching it right now actually.)

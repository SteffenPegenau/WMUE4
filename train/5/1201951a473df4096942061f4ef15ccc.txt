Now.
I'm sure to most he's the guitarist for the Boss who wasn't in the Sopranos or the Underground garage.
Buy this, download, borrow a copy from somebody.
Though I've never been a Pirate's dad or hung out with Amita Pallenberg, so I know I ain't really that guy.
I'm from the Maryland suburbs of DC so Nils is a local hero (whom sadly I have never seen live, I don't get out that much).
Today.
The Back It Up omission shocked me.
The best Nils, though is the live Night After Night double LP.
And since my first name is Keith, I've always thought, I'd never take your fun away guy, who gave me way too much.
Nils is truly a master guitarist and created some great stright ahead rock songs.
Soon.
Just get it .
Grfin and Nils' solo work are top notch rock, and it's too bad he's a niche artist/sideman.
It is indeed his signature song.
Not even sure that ever came out on CD (and too lazy to check in mid typeism).

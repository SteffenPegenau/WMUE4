So I guess that says it all!
Kinda funny that the guy who produced the likes of Jessica Simpson produced this record, because these guys are the real deal.
sets the mood for great songwriting.
Very well produced!
The new songs people will recognize from the shows.
**Revision** - This has become my favorite album by this band.
sounds really good on headphones.
Vegas rocks it out.
But who could fault a great lyric like that one?
I wasn't crazy about the re-make of Anthem of our Discovery, because the last one was picture perfect.
It's full of power and sincerity, and it has grown on me and hasn't left my car in 2 months.
other highlights for me are maria & blue jean.I was originally disappointed by flower in rain being the opener, since it is slow.
"You've Changed" absolutely explodes out of the speakers.
But it is still a great song, so there!Such a Way gets a nice re-do.
very different from the last version, which i also loved.

I pegged out my thermometer in about 5 min.
I plan on making the sauces and using the grill to make really good meals.
I also bought Weber's Big Grill Book.
It was Fantastic.
is that I now plan on really grilling.
It took about 15 min to put together.
******One Month Follow Up******Still love the grill.
The first meal was chicken wings and asparagus.
Tonight we are grilling more asparagus, Portabello Mushrooms, Corn, a few other veggies and Brats!
The cookbook that comes with the grill looks pretty good too.
Not just doing hamburgers, chicken breast and hot dogs.
It started on the first try.
You do need two people to put the Grill on the base.
Cooking out about 4 nights a week.
Had a great July 4th BBQ for 15 people.
Well, as others have said, the packaging was great and set up was a snap.
It gets hot very fast.
I guess the biggest difference in this grill and previous grills (charbroil's, sunbeams etc.)

There are a lot of good dance tracks on here...a few songs with an "I'm a Slave 4 U" vibe, a few songs that sound like her old ones, and a few totally different ones.
13 good tracks n it doesn't even cost a lot.
Personally, I think this has to be one of my favorite albums.
This record is great!
!
I don't know WHY people are putting this album into question...I love it.
Sound like a deal to you?
Why are people dissin Ms.Spears?
Her vocals aren't as strong as they could be but the songs don't really call for high notes.
I mean, she even co-writes a few songs.
This is a milestone in Britney history!
I'm proud of the girl.
It's not all bubble gum pop - it's a whole buncha stuff mixed together.
Maybe it's just because I'm a music lover and I listen to everything, but hey, give Britney some credit.
Well, all I have to say is...GO OUT AND BUY THE ALBUM IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT!!!!!!
Britney isn't Diana Ross...She's Britney and she does her own thing.

I keep saying, I told you, it's Danny Gregory's book.Thank you, man.
Not alone am I sketching every day but I am really happy.
It was never enough.
No.
The Special Thing.
And it is so...my friends and family can't believe the breakthrough and keep asking me what happened.
Now my drawing is better than it's ever been, and that's all I care about (ok, I care about selling it too).
Then my mum sent me Danny's book for my birthday.
That was nearly a month ago.
Then I started sketching every day.
So I took him at his word and just took my pen for a walk.
I was never catching the special thing.
Well, I was, but only ever by accident.
I have fretted all my life about not catching the magic...I run two small illustration businesses and have loads of fine art commissions...so far so good, no?
Danny says it's not the result that matters.
I suspected that drawing as I was always meant to draw would give me that happiness.
Even the kids stopped talking when I began to read it out loud.

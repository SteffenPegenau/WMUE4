I last heard Al back in the 70's.
Then, he was gone!
And I forgot about him.
Radio stations are MAD for having forgotten or snubbed this man!!
If you thought you knew Al Stewart, BUY THIS ALBUM!!
You will LOVE it!
The musical pictures he paints are Picasso's and Van Gogh's -- classic and yet modern.
He sounds EXACTLY the same as he did 35 years ago!
!
Last week, I saw him perform live at a small guitar store in Santa Monica, California.
His music is nothing short of genius, his lyrics, politically savvy or just plain lush.
If you've never heard of him, BUY THIS ALBUM!
MY GOD, the man is a musical genius!!
They were on our radio over and over.
Year of the Cat, Time Passages, On the Border.

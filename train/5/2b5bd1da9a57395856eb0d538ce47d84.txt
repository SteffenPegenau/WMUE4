A lot of ground is covered here, in just under two hours.
Luck.
I remember renting this movie in the 80's and being so awestruck by it.
Hope.
It stands the test of time.
Despair.
I have always kept it in mind, but it has only recently been released on DVD.
A beautiful film, a must-see for film enthusiasts...
It is full of the exquisite details that draw you in like a passionate lover against whom you have no control.
Please see it.
Family.
There is a good bit of Italian spoken, but the acting is so lovely, that you don't need to know a word, to understand perfectly all that is happening.
It is all there, and you will not be disappointed.
It is a story of an Italian couple who marry against everyone's wishes, for love.
The acting is top-notch, from the beloved Nonna to little Eddie Luca, who tells the story.
It makes you laugh and cry, and you feel as though you know these characters.
Love.

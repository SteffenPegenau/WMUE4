This is a great movie.
Its hard to do that in any movie especially one where there are so many characters.
It is way better than the second one.
In all I would say that this film is a turn gold standard of Japanese films.
Every character is fully developed and most have back stories.
Its also not 'too artsy'.
Its one of my all time favorites.
Its is so disturbing not because a bunch of friends are forced to kill each other but because of the way everything is handled.
There was one weird moment where the main girl character has a dream.
That's really the only part I didn't understand.
Also the manga gets a little boring at times and is more of a porno than anything else.
The movie has great acting and is never hard to understand.
I prefer this movie over the long winded book which you have to strain yourself to read the violence.
Every violent act is done is a screwed up humorous way.
its perfect.

I wanted TV in my wife's sewing room, but it's next to impossible to get a cable to that room.
Moved both switches to channel 4 it worked like a charm.
Signal goes through 2-3 walls and floor.
We installed DirectTV a couple of weeks ago.
Rotated and couldn't get it to go away.
Then I remembered that there were four channels.
I like the way the remote control works from the local TV, through the receiver/transmitter, to the "mouse" and then to the DirectTV box.
Turned off other wireless devices and got no improvement.
Decided to try this RF-Link product.My transmitter is in the south side of 2nd story house.
I finally broke down and got cable service.
The reveiver is on north side main level.
Same static.
Couldn't be better.
At first, there were statically lines and sound cackle.
I moved from channel 1 to 2.

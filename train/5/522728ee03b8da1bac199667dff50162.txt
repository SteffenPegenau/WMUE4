For over 20 years I have been searching for this album.
P.S.
In those days we had a "mono" phonograph".
Again, a huge thank you, Amazon!!
With the advent of CD's, I was hopeful that I would find it reproduced on CD.
I ordered 2--one for Dad for Christmas and one for me!
We first got the album Christmas of 1965.
The delivery was prompt, and I am listening to it as I write this.
Ray Conniff has a wonderful gift for touching the harts of both young and old, for my grandparents enjoyed Conniff's Christmas music as well.
In Canada, this CD or any Christmas CD by Conniff is not available.
By the time we got a stereo, the album was not available.
Lo and behol, there is was.
I had just turned 10.
So I checked Amazon.com.
My father often said that that so much of Christmas is Conniff's Christmas music.
It was not until I heard this album did I fully appreciate Christmas Carols.
Ray Conniff's "We Wish You A Merry Christmas" holds so many precious memories for my family and me.

It even can record FM broadcasts at a set time.
I use both.
Well worth the money.
The Iriver T10 player is just perfect.
You also have an option to record FM or voice.
I have no complaints about this player.
The T10 comes with a neckstrap and an armstrap.
The sound is awesome even with the supplied earbuds.
I use Shure E2C's which are wonderful.
The player just kicks on at the specified time and records.
Nice feature!I take the T10 to sporting events and listen to the radio broadcast of the game and catch up on other scores.
Hopefully they can expand future models to 2 GB someday.The FM feature is great.
Even when indoors it comes in nice and clear.
The arm strap is nice when jogging.
You don't even have to be there.
It is just what I was looking for in a player.
The FM reception is far better then I expected it to be.
The 1GB storage is nice.
It is a nice investment.

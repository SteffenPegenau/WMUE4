Emmy's right & left!
That is sure different.
CMT wouldn't air that video because of the contents.
Shame on them!
I'm not saying that Miranda Lambert will be other Waylon or Johnny Cash, but you could say she takes one step over the line.
Buy the album, you won't be sorry.
I bought that cd & was very impressed.
Singing and writing songs like "Kerosene", "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend" and "Gunpowder & Lead" reminds me a little of Johnny Cash's "Delia's Gone".
When I saw Miranda Lambert singing "Kerosene" on the Country Music Awards a couple of years ago, I said "Who is that?"
With Ol' Waylon and Johnny Cash gone, there is nothing much out there on the Country radio waves that pleases my ears.
I don't buy too many cd's anymore.
I like something different.
That's another thing that I like about Miranda, she writes most of her own songs.
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is just as good if not better.
Johnny got them back.

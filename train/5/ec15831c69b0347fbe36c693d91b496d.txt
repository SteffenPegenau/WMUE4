And I live in Grants Pass,Oregon , About 50,ooo people, so I guessed right,no trunking devices.
I only installed 10 Frquencys in a 100 channel scanner.
Perfect choice For my needs!!
punched holes in it and put it in a binder.
Do not pick this one for Nascar, It is the 4th from the top rated by Uniden.....
I live in Mountains and hilly country and programing was 10 times easyer than my mp3 player.
!It has way more feauters than I need.
I researched scanners for a week.
I highly recomend this scanner!!!!!
All are very clear!!
I downloaded the manual so it would be letter size.
!
My first scanner was in 1977 and was a crystal 8 channel scanner.This is my second and get ni-mh batterys.
The Bearcat72xlt was a perfect choice.
It was 63 pages long and gave perfect instructions what to do.I also downloaded the frequencys with no problem for my county.

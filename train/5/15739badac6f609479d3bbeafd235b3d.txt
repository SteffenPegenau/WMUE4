In time you will understand, as a 1-star reviewer, that you have made a complete fool of yourself repeatedly by posting lame reviews.
Why can't you?
I'm dealing with her undeniable knack for making hits.
I'm no longer struggling with her ability to trump her critics at the drop of a dime.
I can sit here and write 5-star reviews all day long.
I've come to terms with the fact that she's one of the greatest singers ever.
Thank you.
Haters...the more you hate, the more she's going to sell.
I know you'll love it.
The End.
But until your day of realization, until your brain comes back from vacation, may I suggest an emancipation.
Just risk the temptation.
One day you shall realize the gravity of your error.
But should you not want to play along, and listen to Mariah's beautiful songs.
I'm sorry that Mariah has a great voice and I'm sorry that she made a great album.
I've accepted it.
So just step back and let it go because you're wasting your time.

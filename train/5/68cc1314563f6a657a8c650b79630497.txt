I loved this movie.
On the dvd, tricks of the trade were shown and i couldn't believe how easy some were.
(an axe named OTIS, a lead pipe and a pair of gloves.)
you'll love it
I definately think this was one of the best films i've seen this year.
i didn't understand one reviewer's comments.
(like two flashlights looking like headlights) The plot was fastpaced all the way through and you find yourself not knowing whose side your on.
they said it was good, well done movie yet they gave it 1 star because it might make people go crazy or something.
you can't rate a movie like that, if you like it you like it.
Ok sorry i rambled a bit.
watch this movie.
you know soon enough though.
that jsut doesn't make since-if it's good, it's good, regardless of how some people might react.
it was creepy and a little scary but the main thing was it was a great story and and the filmmaking was superb.
I loved little quirky things about the film like the "magical" weapons dad recieved.

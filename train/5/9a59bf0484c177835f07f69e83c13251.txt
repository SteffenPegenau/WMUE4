Great action.
Rated #2 on my Bond list.
Connery looks great.
A big score by the one and only John Barry.
The best photography of any Bond film.
Has there ever been better underwater action ssequences before?
Play it loud.
Commentary, different themes, documentaries,etc.
That thing has everything!
And it looks beautiful!
Good dubbing.
It's just fun!
Largo-the best villain.
Hopefully this DVD will look as good as the special edition version laser disc.
They went all out on this movie in '65.

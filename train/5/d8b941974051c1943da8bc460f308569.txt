What I disliked: 1) the goat, as the other readers.
If you don't like it, better stay away.And for reference let me put how I value the other books in this serie:1:5+ 2:5+ 3:4 4:1+ 5:3+ 6:5+ 7:3 8:5-Some extra things I liked in this book: 1) no lengthy recaps of the past.
Well, if you read the other books and think he was preaching in those, you'll think the same here.
And it also streightens a few issues of the past books.
One that is way less trivial than the themes used in books 3-6.
2) cool twist at the end.
Once.
Some of the previous books got much invested with that.
:)I see lots of people claim Goodkind is preaching.
(Same stands for the previous books) here she finally does.
Another gem to the collection.
2) Kahlan not using her power.
Then stops at that, wonder why.And what don't really get: we should run out of dark sisters by now, shouldn't we?Paul
For one it picks up a theme that made me lots of thinking anyway.
I liked this book very much.

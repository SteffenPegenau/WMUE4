Why pay more for a personal MD?
And MD (and the Sharp) is superb.
This is an amazing piece of kit at the price.
Put it like this ...
Having a holiday?
Out to lunch?
My advice is that if you don't know about MD, then find out.
I bought this thing more out of curiosity - after I heard it, I bought a Sony minidisc hi-fi for the home, and then I bought a Blaupunkt MD for the car.
What are the marketing people doing?
They just got it right first time (like someone got the Lexus 400 right first time).
Don't trust me, go out and listen to it, trust your ears, and buy one ... now!.
In fact, the whole MD concept is amazing.
If you do, then you would do much worse than to buy the Sharp MDMT15S Portable MiniDisc Player/Recorder.
Frankly, it's stunning.
MD is where it should be at.
Dead?
Who needs CDs?
And the company ain't paying me anything (yet!).
No-one needs tapes.

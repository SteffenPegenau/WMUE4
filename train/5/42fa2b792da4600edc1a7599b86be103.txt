It is so easy to swaddle and actually holds.
I love that the have sewn the "Swaddle process" on the blanket itself for my husband (when i have to run to the store).
Swaddle sacs are great but they can only be used until they are too big.
These will last much longer.
I researched and researched and finally purchased four of these.
That these would work better
The quality is far far better than the four packs you can buy for $14-20 at local stores.
My absolute favorite thing about this (besides the amazing colors) are how big they are.
They will last far longer than the swaddle sacs you can buy.
As an O.C.D.
I decided instead of buying $160-300 crib bedding set for them that comes with nothing you can ACTUALLY use besides a crib sheet.
I am about to order 2 more.
pregnant woman.
Once i opened them i knew right away they were going to be amazing!
They look amazing.

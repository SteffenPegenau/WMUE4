John Grisham has got nothing on this guy.In short, read this book.
I did.
Readers will find it maddeningly moralistic, pompus and self important.
I think so.
If you can make it through to the end, you will be rewarded with edge of your seat, nail biting tension.
Act Three will leave you breathless, and isn't it all the more worthwhile when you've had to work to get to the end?
READ IT!
I've seen the film, loved that, and I was determined to get through the muddy waters of the book.
Thank you, Richard Adams!
This book is considered one of Adams' weaker works.
It was worth it.
Be prepared to hate it.
Do not skip to the end.
It follows the intrepid adventures of two dogs who have escaped from an animal research station in the Lake Country, U.K.But listen - I nearly threw this book across the room a half dozen times when reading it.
The last forty-some pages of this book are pure genius, absolutely riveting narrative.

I think the two albums I've had in the last week were bad before they ever got packed.
Side one was glorious.
I write simply as a heads up about the manufacturing quality of the record its self.
OK, back to Amazon.
So, again, back it goes.
I won't even try to explain what a brilliant and important recording this is.
It sat nicely on the turntable.
With every revolution the needle was shaken side ways.
Side two skipped on the first band.
Not an up and down bump but a side to side one.
The record was the same shape.
Amazon is very sensitive about their shipment of records and developed that swell shipping box.
I'll wait a month and maybe they'll get a new batch.
This is the first bad record I've gotten here so no hard feelings but this is an album I have to have.
The first record was visibly bowed before I cut the shrink wrap.
It would not sit on the turntable.
Record two looked good from the outside.
It works great.
Previous reviews have done that.

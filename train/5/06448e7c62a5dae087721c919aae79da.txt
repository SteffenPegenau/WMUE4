And, it's got a better sound reproduction than the OBCR.
It's definately better than the HORRIBLE Original London Cast CD.
Now, eventhough this CD gets 5 stars, I do have two complaints... the guy who plays Berger cannot sing very well (in my opinion) and where is "Don't Put It Down?"
His rendition of "Where Do I Go?"
This has got to be the best recording of HAIR EVER!!!
All you have to do is give up all desire and BUY THIS CD!!
The ensemble singing is spectacular, the solo songs are great the the orchestrations are fantastic.
John Barrowman does a fantastic job a Claude.
That is a great song.
Both are really great songs.
!
had got to be the best version of that song I've ever heard.
I am greatful for the inclusion of "All You Have To Do," and "Dead End."
The singing on that one is awful.
Basically, if you own the other three Hair CD's, (which I do), then you have to get this version.

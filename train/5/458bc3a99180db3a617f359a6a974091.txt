When I started thinking about getting a DSLR the D40 had just come out.
I take it with my almost everywhere.
I can't wait to get different lenses for it.
I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves Nikon and is thinking about getting a DSLR.
It was very easy to use and the Nikon menu design is great.
I love everything about it.
It takes such great pictures.
I guess you can tell which I liked better.
I had been reviving my interest in photography recently.
I was borrowing friends cameras to get a feel for them and to see if I had any preference for Canon or Nikon.
The D40 was a great size and a great price and I figured since it was my first DSLR it would be plenty for me to handle.
It has become my little baby.
I was so excited when I recieved my camera.
I really like how they lay it out.
I debated on a few of the other models, but they were just too much of a cost for me with everything else that I wanted to buy like extra batteries and SD Cards and cases, etc.

Oui.
and never have I been lost or even disoriented (and I have a terrible sense of direction!)
SUPERB mapbook - the BEST (and I've tried nearly all!)
I won't change so long as this GEM is published!
Info section is basic enough to be helpful but not overwhelming.
Easy to use, small, thin, but SO COMPLETE there's no point to any other map collection.
Pourquoi non?
Need the Monoprix or Prixunic nearest your hotel?
Important phone numbers?
A bank?
Typeface is good and clear (tiny, yes - but that's necessary.)
Major sites/monuments?
It's there.
Bien sur.
Even drugstores and churches are marked, as are major dept stores, boutiques and the like.
Have used for many years (replacing as they fall apart - literally!)
See London's version, too - equally as marvelous.

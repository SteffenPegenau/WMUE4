The Pot(6:24)6.
It's a little bit of a grower too, so if you don't at first like it, keep listening to it and you'll eventually come around.This is definalty a bass and drum masterpiece though.
This CD is just as great as their other albums, people just built up their expectations waaaaaaaaaaaay too high.
Every song is part of a larger picture.10,000 days is a little softer than Lateralus or Aenima, but it's still very good.

True, it does have a few recycled riffs, but even Led Zeppelin ripped themselves off too.The main thing you have to keep in mind when listening to this album is that it is an album.

All I ever hear is "Eminem sucks."
He is very talented.
The chorus totally goes with the song.
He is the best in the game and the best lyricist out there.
This CD is the greatest.
Cleaning out my Closet is also a great song.
So, if you love Eminem, buy this CD and don't forget to download his new song We are Americans.
He didn't rip off an Aerosmith sample.
I think that white rappers are going to be huge within fifty years.
I think they will take over the hip hop community because they are so much better at it, and you can understand what they are saying.
Me being an Eminem fan, I take as much critism at school as he does, but I don't care.
I am such an Eminem fan.
This CD proves it all.
It's the same with Dido's chorus.
He doesn't suck!

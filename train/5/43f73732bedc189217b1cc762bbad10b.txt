But we were desperate.
Totally worth the money!
In fact, they just kept spreading and were so painful she was having trouble walking.
I'm happy to say that she is wart-free, thanks to this product.
Nothing worked.
It was the ONLY thing that worked without having to resort to painful freeze treatments.
And if I'm being honest, I wasn't crazy about the price.
We finally broke down and went to the pediatrician.
My daughter had bad plantars warts all over her feet.
I couldn't find it anywhere.
I looked in every store and made tons of phone calls.
Online seems to be the only place you can get it.
Because of her fear of having them "removed", we tried all kinds of OTC remedies as well as all of the home remedies we've heard about.
Something I've never heard of before.
To my surprise he recommended Occlusal-HP.

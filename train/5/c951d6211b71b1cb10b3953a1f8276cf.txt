Probably It is more interesting and fun.
So children can make their Narnia.
alone.
If any other children are in like this situation, they will cry or find their parents.
Lucy, who is main character, is very strong girl.
This book felt to me specially.
I read this book in class time.
So children learn bravery.Also, children learn curiosity.
If I read it when I was young.
She go to strange world.
Because this book is my first experience that I read foreign language book.I think this book is good for little children.
Because Narnia is new world, In imagination.
I wish to recommend this book to parents who has little children.There is a many other useful thing for child.
Narnia is different from person to person.
but she doesn¡t have anything to fear.
Although main character and main story is same.
For example trust, friendship, bravery and so on.

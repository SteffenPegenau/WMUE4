The Yankees won the pennant.
I am a Yankees fan.
THE DIAMONDBACKS HAVE WON THE WORLD SERIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The miricle in The Bronx was over in a flash...New York0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 8 1Arizona1 3 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 15 22 0Game 6 belonged to the Diamondbacks.
Osama Bin Laden was on everyones deathlist.
After sweepin` the Padres and Braves, wining 4 games to 1 agenst the Mets, the towers colapsed.
Everyone was happy again.
They may have lost this one but this was the best.
Game 7 came down to the 11th inning.
3 remarkable comebacks had happened in games 3,4,and 5 gave the yankees a 3-2 series lead.
"The pitch..BASE HIT FOR GONZALEZ.
Untill the Yankees fans (and Mets fans) calmed down to watch the world series.
"That broke the Yankees streak...this was though the best because even thoughYankees = HistoryDiamondbacks = FutureThe Yankees won the pennant and that was good enough
Sorrow had ridden on the city before this.
New York needed some relief.

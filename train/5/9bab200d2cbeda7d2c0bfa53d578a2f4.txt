Or does it have something to do with the murder of Evan a year ago?
Meg must find out.
Could it be that Ellen is coming to town?
The Surprise Party is probably one of the best books in the whole Fear Street series.
It is funny, scary, suspenseful, and has a great storyline.
Remember, you're in for a scare!!
!
But then Meg receives phone calls telling her to cancel the party or else.
Is it just a prank?
Then the party invitations get cut up.
This book is really fabulous.
Read it sonn or you'll be mad you didn't.
Then comes the note in her locker and then the red paint thats supposed to be blood in her lunch bag.
It is about a girl named Meg that throws a surprise party for Ellen, her old bestfriend, because she is coming to visit.
I am certain that every pre- teen will love this book as much as I did.

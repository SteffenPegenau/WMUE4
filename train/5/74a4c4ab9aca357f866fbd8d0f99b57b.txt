The end of "Long Black Veil" gives me shivers.
Quit complaining and just listen!
Now, about some of the reviews after mine.
Complaints about the "Lovely Ladies"?
Both are outstanding.
Outstanding!
Hearing a DMB song in a new way is always enjoyable - I love hearing the keys and the backup singers on so many songs.
The fickleness of DMB fans simplay amazes me.
This CD belongs in your collection!
My goodness - they have three fantastic voices.
The set was varied and entertaining - I love the fact that there are songs from each album, along with songs that have not been released.
I recently got both the album and video versions of Listener Supported and I am simply amazed by both.
I recommend this CD highly.
I saw Boyd sing John Prine's "Angel From Montgomery" a few years ago and it was fantastic.
Someone complaining about Boyd singing?

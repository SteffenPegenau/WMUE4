Come As You Are7.
Nearly a decade later, her voice, her sound, her swagger has only improved.
Her voice is like a treasure, once you've discover it, you'll never want to forget it.
Talk About Our Love ft. Kanye West
Every song on the album is soulful, some great dance tracks and some really relaxing R&B; slow cuts.
Afrodisiac4.
How I Feel3.
Brandy does not get the credit she deserves, which is why Afrodisiac didn't get alot of radio play and/or press.
Where I Wanna Be ft. T.I.6.
Brandy aka B-Rocka is one of the best female aritist around.
She has always been my favorite R&B; artist since her self-Titled debut album "Brandy" dropped in 1994.

Turn It Up8.
All of her albums (1994's Brandy, 1998's Never say Never, 2002's Full Moon & 2004's Afrodisac) are certified classics in my book, expecially Afrodisiac.
This album should be 2x Platinum if it's not already.My Favorite Tracks:1. Who Is She 2 U?2.

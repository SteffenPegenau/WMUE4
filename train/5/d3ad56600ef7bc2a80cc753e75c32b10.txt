After seeing Michael Ball on a PBS channel where I live, I am now a big fan of his!
I listen to it over and over again.
Yes, it is hard to believe, isn't it.
I had never heard of him before that.
Act, sing any type of song so very well, and make us smile too!
Thumbs up Michael!
I have become a true fan, and am hopeing Michael Ball delights us with a US tour very soon.
I know you will enjoy this CD, and it will leave you wanting more!
Wow, what a voice Michael has!
All of the songs on this CD are so good, and I especially like to hear him sing Gethseme, from the musical, Godspell.
Since first listening to this CD, I have purchased others by him.
I have listened to this CD, and it is wonderful.
He can do it all.
It brings back to mind his great performance at the Royal Albert Hall, and the terrific voice I had heard.
He is truly talented.

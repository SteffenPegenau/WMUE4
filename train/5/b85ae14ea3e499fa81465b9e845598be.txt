You've read the other reviews.
A screen to protect the PSP screen.
I've had too horrible dropping incidents.
Snug, form-fitting rubber.
The PSP travel case saved the PSP.
You can play games with the PSP in the case.
The headphone jack is covered up, so you can't just listen to phones with the PSP in the case.
The PSP was in the case both times.
Most definitely.
Both times the PSP was unharmed.
That's a minor problem.Does it protect the PSP?
The big minus?
Both times the case came open and the PSP came out.
I have not had a single problem due to the drops.Get this is you want to protect your system.
All true.
(That's fairly accurate as to how both incidents played out.)
In fact, I think it's as essential as a charger and Memory Sticks.
It would have been better if the case didn't open, but the way I see it, the case took the brunt of the impact, it opened and the PSP kinda slid out.

Of course.
Unfortunaly for Nina Idi, she is an illegal child.
You can call Nina honest.
Now her life is going to change.
Forever.What I like about Among the Betrayed is that how the author gave Nina great qualities.
(If you delete the part about her fake i.d.
Jason betrays her, and turns her into the Population Police.
However , you can't call Nina normal.
For in her community the third-child in the family is illegal.
In a nightmare you usually get to to wake up.
)Would I give this book a reccomendaion?
Nina is a girl who thinks before she acts.
Or as her real name calls her Elodie Luria.
Like cause and effect.
However for Nina......she is living one.Nina Idi.
It is perfct for any reader who loves action, a little bit of romance,and drama.
Have you ever had a nightmare?
Jason, he is the love of Nina's life.So she thinks.
Your normal average six-teen year old.
Its nothing compared to Nina Idi.

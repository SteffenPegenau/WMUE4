He was so adorable.
This is one romantic suspense that I highly recommend.
The Stanfield's clan was so twisted.
But it made for exciting reading.
I just finished reading this book and I had to slow down because I did not want it to end.
Logan really does sound like a man to die for.
This was a wonderful book.
This was my first time reading Meryl Sawyer and now I must read more.
I loved every minute of it.
Go slow, because you will not want it to end.
I fell in love with little Rafi.
The things he went through during his childhood just broke my heart.
The love between Logan and Kelly was so touching.
Enjoy.
There is absolutely no way you could be disappointed.
I'd love to read more about Logan, Kelly, Pops, and Rafi.
Tears streamed down my eyes several times.

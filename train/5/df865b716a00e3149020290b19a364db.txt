This film works nevermind the time of year.
Chevy Chase is a comedic lovers dream.
You'll also love the teaming of Diane Ladd and Doris Roberts.
All roads in this film lead to fun.
I adore E.G.
Jeremiah Chechik brought me to this film.
Although they don't interact much, they feed off of each other to a great effect.
This film has it all for the funny lover.
The writing is insanely good.
Marshall, his comedic/horror acting was/is grand in "Creepshow".
The direction was fabulous.
Even Beverly D'Angelo is cast well here to compliment Chase.
The cinematography doesn't take from the comedic skill in this film.
His direction in "Diabolique" intrigued me.
The irritating and grotesque Randy Quaid is likeable, yet leavable.
What intrigued me more was the fact that this film, like "Joon", wasn't my kind of film.

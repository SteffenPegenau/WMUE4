look!
the fact that the main character was deaf and dumb really made me feel frustrated at times.
i found myself yelling at the tv "turn around!
the tragic irony of the whole situation made my stomach hurt.
mr vengeance was very disturbing.
its like...korean kevin smith only really really good.
look behind you!".
just writing this review makes me want to watch it right now.
it was very well executed.
they are a series but they arent related.
if you like great movies with twists, turns, and a mess of blood check it out.
he was trying to do good but things went terribly wrong.
it was awesome.
i got old boy first and then i got lady and mr vengeance after the fact.
there are some references in the movies that youll pick up on which is cool.
you have to get old boy, and lady vengenace too.

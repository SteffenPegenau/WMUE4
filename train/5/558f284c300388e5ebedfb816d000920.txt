I thought it was the best one yet.
The three siblings have to go to a hotel to spy there and figure out which one of the two workers there, acting as the same person, is the true person and which one is an imposter.
I never wanted to read the Series of Unfortunate Events.
Along the way they are surprised to find old friends and mostly old enemies.
But then I read the first one, then the second, then the third, ect.
The hotel was the library in this book!
They can't have a break from the job.
This book was sooo interesting, especially since the hotel is organized using the Dewey Desimal System!
So imagine how excited I was when FINALLY the twelvth came out!
I highly recommend this book to any SOUF fan, and for the ones who haven't read the books... Start reading them NOW!
I considered them stupid.
They're awesome!
I was crazy about them.
By the way, did you notice that there's one library in every book?
They even have to sleep at their desk!

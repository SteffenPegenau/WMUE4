and shopping!!
its so girly girl.
OMGOSH!
im a girl but im just saying!
sure you all LOVE it.
give it up!
i love snow boarding and hey i love skirts as much as the next girl but the skirts sre way too short.
this product is for certain girls and you know who you are.
i hate shopping.
it gives kids bad ideas about flirting and boys and clothes that should be worn by sluty rock stars.
anyway, this is a lousy item.
all those girls who love shopping and stupid girly girl things.
all you do is go to school.
like to make a boy!
like hitting on boys and getting GIRLFRIENDS.
make stupid friends and have a boyfriend.
that is way over 13. this item needs coolness.

From French to Japanese, and even English, the vocal songs are mellow and harmonic.
Even the songs without words, which I usually skip when it comes to anime soundtracks, are amazing.
They are quite beautiful.
African, American, Chinese, Japanese, it's all here!
They combine music from practically every race and culture.
^-^
If I had to sum up this CD in one word, it would definately be "masterpiece".
I mean, I have several anime soundtracks, from Blue Seed to Ah!
So, basically, I would definately recommend this CD to anyone who does not want to just waste their money on a CD with one or two good songs.
The songs are magnificent.
Megami-sama, and even Fushigi Yugi.
But, I have to say, this is one of the few CDs that I can listen to all the way through, and still be satisfied.
I bought this CD about a year ago at the local Suncoast, and I was immediately hooked.
Wow.
Even classical and modern are combined.
So buy this CD!
This soundtrack is absolutely fantastic.

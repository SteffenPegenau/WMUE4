This is a must buy!
I can't wait see what else they have in store for us.
But my favorite song in the show is NOTICE ME HORTON.
David Shiner as The Cat in the Hat is no singer.
I loveeee this song!
I especially love the HERE ON WHO song.
Janine LaManna and Kevin Chamerberlain are wonderful as Guertrude and Horton.
It is a lot of fun!
ALL AROUND GREAT RECORDING!
But if you can sell your songs, you'll have everyone on your side!
They play really well off of each other.
I heard this recording before it was released to the public and I have to say that it is wonderful.
His voice is obviousy not as up to par as the rest of the cast.
These characters are so big and they carry such a beautiful poignancy to each song they sing.
There is great harmony on this recording.
But, he provides a sort of energy to the role that it needs.
Rosie O'Donnell is playing the part for a few more days and she is by now mean a beautiful singer.

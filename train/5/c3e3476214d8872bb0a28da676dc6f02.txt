Elfis will go down in history as one of the greatest comedic moments of all time!
On my way home from purchasing "Little Drummer Boys" I first popped in the Comedy CD.
Cudos to you both if your reading this.
I couldn't believe how funny this thing was!
Knowing that most comedy CD's you listen to once, then you loose it in the back of your CD case never to be heard of again.
But this one ladies and Gents, is a definate keeper.
So I decided to stop and buy it.
After listening to disk number two a few times, i popped in the music CD.
I truly cant wait for the next CD my boys!
5 stars our of 5!
Im a new listener to the Mark and Brian radio Program, and not a day goes by where I don't tune in and listen in the morrning.
On my way home from school, i remembered that the CD came out today.
The songs on that are wonderful, sung and performed by many great performers.
I'll be listening!
Hoody~Hoo!

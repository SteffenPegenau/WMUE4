By most of the songs you can tell this is the happiest she's been in her life.
"Love is a sweet thing", "Lets make Love", "Your bringing out the Elvis is me", "That's how love moves", and "What's in it for me".
I purchased Breathe the day it was released.
I really thought nothing could beat the "Faith" album, so if you liked that one then you'll love "Breathe".
And believe me I was not dissapointed.
The Album is fabulous.
I am very happy with it.
All great songs, with great vocals.
Usually I prefer to wait until a few songs have been released, but Faith is an exception.
Some favorite songs so far.
Thank you.
There's not many artists that I will do that for.
Most of the songs are about love and are uplifting.
That always makes for a great album.
I was counting down the days until it was coming out.

Its a really loose and relaxed show like another guy mentioned.
Reason being was that it does have about 5-6 mistakes through the show.
Its really a different show.
No show is perfect.
The sound mix is still as clear as a live show can be.
The setlist is also pretty strong.
Im still trying to dig deeper into it.
I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good show from the band.
Thats what counts to me.
Its not the best Euro show from 2000, but is still a strong performance of a wonderful band having a great time.
The more you listen to it the more that is obvious.
The guys have fun and put on a pretty tight show, except for those few flubs.
A good sound mix.
It may take some time to really dig in to its beauty, but its worth it.
When I first bought this bootleg I thought it was extremely overrated and wasnt that great.

First of all, I want to point out that this game is hard.
Theres nunchucks swords, war hammer.
!EMAG SIHT YUB.
But thats nothin to wine and complain about.
And for the throwing weapons, theres throwing stars and a bow which you can go in to first person and shoot (for all you FPS fans).
It makes the game more challenging.
Besides if you get boggled down by enimes, ITS CALLED THE LEFT TRIGGER!
They feel completly different from each other.
(subliminal messaging)
Bottom line, you'd have to be crazy not to at least rent this game.
The weapons are all different, with different moves for each one.
Think of Prince of Persia mixed with soul caliber.
This game is one of the best games on any system.
Anyway, the graphics are great, the gameplay is great.
it blocks any attack.
Somewhat like that but on crack.

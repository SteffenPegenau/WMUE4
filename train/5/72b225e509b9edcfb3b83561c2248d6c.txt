show.
Anyway, there needs to be a huge protest by the fans of the "Q" to make ALL of his music readily availiable in the U.S. as well as overseas.
!
The title song "Mellow Madness" is the pace song for this album.
Never mind that the Brothers Johnson were introduced on this effort.
This is criminal!
Why isn't this album more available on cd than it is?
I was only maybe 10-12 years of age, but I still had an appreciation for good music when I heard it.
MADNESS !!
So I could never convince either one of them to take a chance on "Q".
"Q" is at his very best for this place in time.
I remember listening to this song as it played on the radio.
The slight interest that they did have in him was when "the theme from Sanford and Son" played on the radio.
My parents love Redd Foxx and this t.v.
It's total madness that we can't get this effort in the U.S.
My parents weren't into Quincy Jones as I was.

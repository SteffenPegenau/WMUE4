She has a half decent one but poor Kero-chan.
(Sorry if I made any grammatical errors or spelling errors.)
OK buy this DVD if you are a Cardcaptors fan, but if you are a Cardcaptor Sakura fan DON'T THINK ABOUT IT!
NELVANA CHANGED IT TOO MUCH!
(Tear drop) OK she now has one of the worse voices EVER!
I can sorta get over Sakura's voice.
He sounds like a New York City cab driver.
IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!
I have never seen the Japanese version of the Firey episode so I don't know how good or horrible it really is.
Ok.
EVEN IF I'M LOOKING FOR THIS DVD DON'T LOOK FOR IT!
The show is great.
Li I can get over too.
I'm giving this too many stars but I just cant do this to one of my favorite episodes.
But Tomoyo.
The cuts and voices are horrific.
JUST DONT BUY IT!
Unless you are a CC fan don't buy this DVD unless you are upsessed with the episodes in English.

I cannot say enough great things about this travel mug.
It fits right in our car cup holders with ease.
If you need a travel mug for your drink, buy this one.. it is worth EVERY penny.
It was amazing.
I bought 2 of these.
I am so happy.
Thermos GOT IT RIGHT!!
Its the one that DOES NOT LEAK.. NOT EVEN A DROP!
This is by far the absolute BEST coffee travel mug I have ever owned.
I mean real HOT!!
On Christmas morning after I opened it up, I poured some pipping hot coffee in it.. Then I got busy and forgot all about it for 3 hours...
I went back took a sip, and it was HOT..
I will buy 2 more and pack them away.Jason in Cornelius Oregon
One for myself, and one for my wife.
I was so happy, I carried it with me all day.

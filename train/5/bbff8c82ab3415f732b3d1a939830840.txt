After the show, popped it in, and was amazed.
Ahhh.
The lead singer, Dan...has one of the best voices, I have ever heard.
And they have amazing musical skills.
I would diffidently consider picking this CD up.
These guys are going to be the next big thing.
One of the best bands ever, in my opinion.
They're lyrics are real and easy to relate to.
There's bonus footage which is hilarious.
Story of the Year.
Absolutely amazing band.
The band name is perfect for the band.
When I went to a Good Charlotte concert, some members of the Story of the Year street team handed out some free demos.
A new edge of Rock music is on this CD.
These guys make great music.

This was truly an urban erotic tale to the T, and it starts at G-Spot.
Its a good read.
I love Noire.
Most of my reading experience with this book, I couldn't put it down.
This definitely wasn't a romance.
Go to AskNoire.com Twitter.com/AskNoire Facebook.com/NoireBlack - Readers make Noire your favorite.
Keep blessing us for what you do.
She's one of my top 10 Authors in the literary world.
So urban readers go get G-Spot, G-Spot2 Pride; the 1st deadly sin, and others under Noire.
I know Noire has many good books under her belt, and this is my second book I read, and will have all in my possession.
Noire, me personally, you are worth 10 stars baby.
This was a very interesting book to read.
I definitely recommend G-Spot, and don't forget G-Spot 2 Pride: the first deadly sin which is told in seven different parts.
At times I would try staying up reading this book as long as I can from having a long day.
Its a must read.

You would not delay.
This set does very well with it.Ok, so now buy it.I am serious.
I can't believe I waited.
The HD picture is nearly perfect.
Just do it, you will not regret it.
Even on low-def signals (digital from DirecTV), it does very well.
Did you buy it yet?
If I sat you down in front of this TV (Samsung HPT5054 50" Plasma HDTV), you would buy one.
No complaints.
Fast action, it's great.
Dark scenes, it's great.
Computer graphic wipes and logos, it's great.
I have it in a very brightly lit living room, it's great.
Most plasma or LCD set struggle with low-def.
You would pull out your iPhone, log into Amazon, and punch in your credit card number.I am serious.It is silly.

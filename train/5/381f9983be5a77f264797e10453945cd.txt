July came around, and I got my score.................After 5 month of consistent review, I got a 1.
I knew every question on that test.
Can you believe that!
Only I knew it wrong.
I finished 30 minutes before the time ran out and felt pretty confident that I aced the exam.
I got the names confused and thought that I was set to study PSYCHOLOGY.
After taking an AP Psychology class, I was looking for a great book to review for the test.
What kind of idiot gets a 1 after reviewing for so many hours.
My advice to you is that if you take this exam, make sure you register for Psychology, and not Physiology.
5 month before the exam, I spent an hour everyday reviewing a chapter.
Turns out I was studying Physiology.
I know right, a 1?
Those two are very different.
When the test day finally came, I breezed through it.
This was an incredible ride.

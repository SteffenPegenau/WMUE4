I couldn't help it- I bought it.
All I knew was that my mom was in love with him.
The lyrics are compelling, and the rythym of the songs makes you want to snap your fingers, clap your hands, and tap your toes.
Father and Daughter is so sweet, and I love that the echoes is his daughter.
I recomend this CD to anyone who likes Simon and Garfunkel (uh-duh) or the Beatles, or even if you don't like either, who cares?
What is that about?
Give it try.
I makes you think, especially me, 'cuz half the stuff he's talking about is totally confusing.
I'd never really heard Paul Simon ('cept for the songs from The Capeman) when I picked up the CD in fye.
And it's really, really good!
Sure Don't Feel Like Love and Outrageous are my favorite songs on the track.
They have the best beat, in my opinion, and the coolest lyrics.
Like, I'm wearing my fathers old coat?
How Can You Live in the Northeast is really, really good.
You may be surprised.

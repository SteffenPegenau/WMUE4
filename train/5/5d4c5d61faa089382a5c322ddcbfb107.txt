SlipKnot are going to explode!!
I have been following them since like Mid 1998.
Watch out, cuz they will be killer!!
BEST BAND EVER!!
There are no words to descriebe how damn amazing SlipKnot is!!!!
There are no band tracks on the album.
Anyone who says they sound like Limp Bizkit is even stupider!
Limp Bizkit is one of the worst bands in the world, they can't touch the talent of SlipKnot!!
You have no Idea how long I have been waiting for their album!!
They signd my album and a small poster I got.
Not a KoRn Clone!!!
!
I got it like on release date, and I wasn't disapointed AT ALL!!
I have seen them live and their is no band that puts more emotion and raw energy in their performance!!
Anyone who says that this band sounds like KoRn is an Idiot!!!
SlipKnot is SLIPKNOT!!
I also met all NINE of them, and they are sooo down to earth and cool!!
NOW THIS IS WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT!!!

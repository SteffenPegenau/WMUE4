We have three young kids and we do not buy bread any more.
Whatever we are in the mood for.
Just depends on our mood!
Thin crust, thick crust.
What a great machine!
This is my first experience with a breadmaker.
We make pizza dough in it now and the taste is fantastic!
This machine is so well designed, just a quality product.
I could not be more pleased!
They top the dough with whatever they prefer, how much of a certain topping they like, and they are having fun eating healthy!
It is so easy to learn to use, the care is simple, I like the programming options.
I will never again buy greasy pizza and feed it to my kids.
I can also program my own cycles if I want to.
I can set it to make bread over night.
So good to know I am feeding my kids preservative free bread and can choose the flour we use, whole wheat, unbleached, white.

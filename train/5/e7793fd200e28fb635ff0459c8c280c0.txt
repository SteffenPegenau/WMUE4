I love it.
I hope if she writes a sequel we will still see Jeremy and Maggie as well as Edward and Pegeen.
And Pegeen and Edward are still romantic.
Oh to have someone like Jeremy.
I will definitely buy any book written by Patricia Cabot.
The way he assumed she would say yes when he first asked her to marry him and she laughed in his face.
He just wouldn't let Maggie go.
I love Jeremy and Maggie.
This sequel to her first book is marvelous.
It was so romantic.
I remember reading in the first book how Maggie was the bane of Jeremy's existence.
I can't wait until Patricia comes out with another book!!!
I hope it's another sequel because I so love seeing Pegeen and Edward again.
Childhood sweethearts.
Now he is taller than her and stronger.
He is so funny.
Pegeen is pregnant again with her seventh child indicating Edward still cannot keep his hands off her as in the first book.
I read this book twice.
How he couldn't retaliate against her because she was a "girl".

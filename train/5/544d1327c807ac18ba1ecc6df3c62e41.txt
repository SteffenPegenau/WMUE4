Get the Jedi Starfighter to challenge it in the astroid field.
It's size makes old Slave 1 a tiny green and gray lump.
The cool thing is that the rotating laser cannons don't slouch down like other LEGO products.
So hurry up and get it where ever.
I also found somthing wrong.
If you don't get it you'll be sorry!!!!!!
It's also very durable.
I dropped it and only 2 pieces came of!
(It also costs you $$$!)
When you look in the back of the ship above where the prison compartment is there is a hole where you can see 1-2 of the mini-figs in the place where Jango and Boba control the ship and if there was a hole when they were flying in space they would die.
I'm also a LEGO CLUB member.
This is a must have for Lego fans.
This is so cool.
I recomend this to everybody who loves lego,Lego Technic,or lego bionicle.
I got this for Christmas.
It took me about 45mins to build.

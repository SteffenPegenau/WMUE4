wasn't sure how to apply the pad but one i aligned it to my shirt, it worked!
so.
like worse than I heard it was going to be!
some are disposable, some washable.
i wore them on my last flying job.
it's so annoying and i can't control it.
see how they work.but this will suffice for now.
I googled sweat help and somehow, many forms of shirt pads came up.
I sweat thruout the day and night and my work shirts are getting the worst of it.
i'm a flight attendant and i'm going thru perimenopause (i know.
underarm yellowing and smell.
some are stick ons, some are snap to bra.
i mean, i sweat still but at least my shirt is saved!it's gonna be costly ultimately buying them all the time or....i'm going to try the washables next.
i bought both.
this is the disposable stick ons.
hope it works for you!
too much information!)
so i have hot flashes all the time!

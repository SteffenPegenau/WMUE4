But i repeat the actual bottom line.
They wanted him to do it again.
He asked me to be sure to put it out on the web.
He's been through the Pegasus treatment, it hadn't worked but had about broken them financially, as well as being very hard on him physically.
He's still something of a luddite.
True story.
He ended up calling Dr. Zhang and going to him.
Hard working carpenter, family man and a good person in his late 50's Likely picked up hep in the military with a blood transfusion, he'll never know.
His blood work indicated he was actually worse than before he did it.So he asks me to buy another book from Amazon about herbs and hep C, and i do, but see this and i bought it for him.
But he's a healthy luddite now.
He's well now.
Actually fealt moved to buy it for him.
This costs a fraction of the Pegasus treatment ahd wasn't hard on him physically.
I bought this book for a buddy who isn't online.
His blood work say's he's got it well under control.

Good sound3.
Here is my chart:Pros"1.
They are the best, ranging from the easy 'Luigi's Raceway' to the hard 'Yoshi Valley' to the super hard 'Rainbow road'.You can pick characters such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, DK, Bowser, Toad, Yoshi, and more.
Each character/racer has they're own characteristics.This game is a must-have for everyone.
Good tracks2.
There are many multiplayer modes, such as Single Race, and Battle.
In every track, you get weapons such as shells, shrinking stuff, slippery bananas, and more.
It is the best racing game EVER.
Graphics are fair.This game is awsome.
In battle mode you are in an arena and you have to defeat your player by hitting him with weapons.The tracks are spectacular.
Wow.
Buy it!
Buy it now, because it is worth all the money.
Mario Kart is the best racer.
Very fun4.
Great musicCons:1.

This is just what i was looking for in a water jug to sit on my counter.
Being square is nice too.
This is perfect!
Did that get men's attention?!
Nothing negative to say about this one!
The lid is nice as well.
I agree with the one person who wrote that it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out.
We have a water filtration system which dispenses very slowly so I keep a reserve out at all times.
I have large hands and it's not a problem at all.
It will fit into a cooler or refrigerator better.
I didn't like the look of my plastic Tupperware and wanted the cleanliness of glass.
Unless you have only one hand, you should have no problem with the hold and twist design.
Hahahahaa!
The handle seems to be a concern for some but I like its sturdy feel being close to the jar.
I am considering buying a second one just like it.
It seals very nicely.
It holds a bit more than a 1/2 gallon.

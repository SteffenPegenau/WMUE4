From there, I went from mildly impressed to extremely impressed.
They 1) have class (I met them once at a show...they were incredibly nice).
There is hope for music!
All these boybands and pop princesses lip sync...E&J do acoustic shows and nail harmonies like nobody else.
Then...one day, I heard "Crazy for this Girl".
Anyways, I strongly suggest this CD.
Evan and Jaron are often accused of being boyband wannabes.
Evan and Jaron are really, truly musicians (which is hard to find nowadays).
All I hear on the radio is that bubblegum crap that everyone likes.
They are a true joy to listen to!
You won't regret it!
2) They are unbelievable live.
I wasn't thoroughly impressed until I heard the piano solo.
I bought their CD and found that all of the songs are unbelievable.
This couldn't be farther from the truth.
3) They write beautiful songs.
These boys are really artists!
These songs are filled with emotion and meaning.

They are noted to be outstanding parents and good employees.
I believe that is what makes them evil.
They are to be pitied.
Their spouse, their children and their parents.
This type of evil surrounds us in everyday life.
What do you do when you have these people in your life?
For they know deep within themselves that they are evil.
They go to extreme lengths to maintain their "image".
Pray.
They are fearful and they are to be feared.
These people will sacrifice anyone for their own gain.
Nothing or no one gets in their way.
They are masters in their disquises.
They appear to be upstanding citizens.
They cause incredible pain in those surrounding them.
These people are everywhere.
You have to have known the evil that is described by Dr. Peck to understand what he has written.
They have no remorse, no conscience and no regrets.
Once known you have to acknowledge it.

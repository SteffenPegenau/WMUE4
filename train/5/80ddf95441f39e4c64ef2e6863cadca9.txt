No disrespect 2 those bands I think they kick a$$ 2.
I am not saying "Godsmack sux and AIC rulz" unlike some reviewers.
Peace out yall.
U know I am just not following all u "rock fans" when u say GODSMACK is sounds like AIC.
So do ur self a favor and buy this c.d.
Their I have said my peace.
Godsmack's album is much more hard core and angry and great 2 listen 2 after u have had a bad day at work.
Not only is the music cool but each song as a differnt texture 2 it and the songs don't sound the same.
is much better than the current "rock" we have been served (LB, KoRn, and Orgy).
Folks that is my intelligent review of the sound qualities of AIC and Godsmack.
Everyone Godsmack doesn't sound like AIC and Godsmack is a much better band.
Good c.d not great.
W/ all the hype on saying they sound like AIC I thought I would buy AIC album and I got DIRT.
This c.d.
But Godsmack BEATS A$$.

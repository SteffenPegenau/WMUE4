How about a hacker from the Matrix?
This book is the core rulebook for Mage the Ascension Second Edition.
Want to play a tough martial artist who can catch bullets?
This is a great book that can stand alone without supplements, unlike its revised edition.
The worlds beyond the Gauntlet and Horizon are also touched on along with sample umbrood.
Every aspect of the game is elaborated on fully or contains enough information for you to come up with the rest of the details.
The book focuses on the Traditions but there is also a good amount of information on the Technocratic Union, Marauders, and Nephandi for you to use.
The book contains everything you need to understand the Mage universe.
There's a Tradition available just for that.
With this book any game is possible.
I have never played a game with so many possibilities.
There are rules for that too.
This is the best game in White Wolf's game universe.
You want to play a fireball-chucking mage?
No problem.

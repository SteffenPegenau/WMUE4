In the end it all makes sense.
I recommend this to anyone who isn't easily turned off by things.
This is an amazing book.
I couldn't stop thinking about it.
The book is one of the best written stories I've ever read.
What I mean is the details of the story are horrible.
Even years later when I explain it to people they think it is messed up.
And I was caught completely by surprise by several events in the book.
I would try to explain to people the details of the story and most people looked at me like I was crazy and asked why I was reading the book.
This story is horrible.
I couldn't put it down.
I HAD to know what happened.
I read this book not knowing a lot about Dean Koontz.
I was so intrigued by what was going on.
But that's part of what made it so good.

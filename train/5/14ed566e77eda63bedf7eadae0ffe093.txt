I can't wait to read Blue's story.
I've read all of Robyn's books and I enjoyed all three of them.
Until next time.
I loved this thrilling suspense, yet dashing love story.
I was hoping that Jax and Coco developed a more permanent relationship.
However, I was sort of dissappointed with the ending.
Coco was full of laughs, and Jax was tempting altoghether.
I like it.
Say like, marriage !!
Adrian and Mr. Thorp got exactly what they deserved.
I loved the way he threw her over his shoulder when his feelings towards her changed.
Caveman!!
Robyn has done it once again.
Keep up the good work!!
Jail time!!.
Nevertheless, it was a good read.
Jax tried to his best to keep Coco at armslength, but Coco broke down his resistance.

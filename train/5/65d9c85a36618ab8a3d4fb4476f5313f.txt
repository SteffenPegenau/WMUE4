I couldn't imagine any better way to continue the story.Alec is shocked when he learns that someone is out to kill his beautiful Stallion!
Alec is devastated.
The guide was murdered during the storm, and only half a container of water is left.
The next day a man comes and claims he owns the Black.
They push to their destination and kill the camel after collecting its liquid.
Only Alec's is left.
How will the group survive?
This book is simply AMAZING!!
It was something close to that, but not how I expected it.
A sandstorm splits the group from their camels.
Mr. Volec, the owner of Sun Raider comes and decides to help Alec.
Find out in The Black Stallion Returns!
The group travel across the desert with a young housekeeper and a guide.
This book was not what I expected.
I expected Alec to enter a race with a horse in a foreign country or something.
They eat camel meat.

Usually an artist will have cheesy songs that are nothing beyond words, acting as if there is emotional output behind those words.
I love Weezer, but this album was River Cuomo's own.
Every track is fantastic.
Its wonderful.
Apologize for Green, not this.
Thank you Rivers.
The only thing I frown upon is Rivers apologizing for it.
And I can relate to so much that he sings about.
You made an album that so many people can relate to.
You can just feel it.
Pinkerton is true to River's feeling.
Every artist has miserable moments in their lives, times when they are down, but the world doesn't usually care.
Ten tracks of PURE emotion.
Rivers Cuomo is America's absolute best unstarstudded artist.
This is fantastic.
River Cuomo was very, very miserable when he created Pinkerton.

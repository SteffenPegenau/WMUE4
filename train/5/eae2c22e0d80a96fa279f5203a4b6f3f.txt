Sounds like a barnyard.
I bought several of these slingshot toys and took them to work.
Great way to torture your coworkers in the neighboring cubicles!
Eventually I took the sound box out of it to investigate if it needed batteries or what.
I tried saudering/welding the wire onto a connector and got it to make sound, then stitched the animal back up and put him back in the ring.
Its a wonder any of them work.
They are a hoot, especially if you get all of them and have them all going at once.
The Chicken never made a sound and I busted my fingernail back to the nubbin the first time I tried shooting it.
It is very cheaply made.
It had a disconnected wire.
Especially on April Fools day when shenanigans are in season.
He is the sturdiest.
The best one of these is the monkey with the cape.
I got a band-aide and went back to trying to get some sound out of it.
OUCH!

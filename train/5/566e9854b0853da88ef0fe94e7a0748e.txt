.maybe I can understand it - CERTAIN people are sore loosers.
.Oh.
I am so glad that Ruben decided to follow his own heart and style.
I can't understand some of the "hate" on this web site when it comes to him branching out instead of the same cookie cutter songs as other artists.

!
The different styles mixed with his smooth voice puts him on the superstar level of Luther Vandross, Samm Cooke and the like.It is obvious to the practiced ear, Ruben placed his heart and soul into his debut CD.

Give the winners of American Idol a pat on the back for the job performed.
Ruben's long awaited album is absolutely wonderful.
.you are supported by the majority because you are a STAR!!!
My advice is "Let it go!"
His professionalism shines through.
Remember, YOU didn't make it and I doubt if any of us writing to this colum could perform half as well as Mr. Studdard.Keep going Ruben.

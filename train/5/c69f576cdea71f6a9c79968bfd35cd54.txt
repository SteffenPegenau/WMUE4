It seems silly, but it is nice to unlock different things and set them up in your basement "Crib".
Great touch.
NFL Fever is slow at best.
This is the single best pick for X-Box for a few simple reasons.
#4 ESPN name brings with it NFL Primetime, a recap of the weeks games in a season mode.
#2, The game-play flows very smoothly.
This includes highlights from computer-simulated games.
Also, while you can have your buds over for some games, sometimes it nice to play at 3 AM with a real person.
Does the Madden roster accuratly reflect the roster of the teams on Week 1 of the NFL season?
Not essential, but a very nice feature.
#1, On-line play.
Stats for each game are presented with Berman's commentary of the game.
#5, The Crib.
#3, The graphics are outstanding, the sound is good, and the game presentation on screen is great.
Replays are given decent commentary, and the camera angles for them are outstanding.
No on-line play also means no roster updates.
Madden does not have it.

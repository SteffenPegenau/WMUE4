It is so much easier to hold.
It came charged and ready to go.
It is so convenient.
If you haven't tried the 6" Display Kindle Wireless Global, Latest Generation Reading Device, you don't know what you are missing.
The screen lighting is perfect in both daylight and nightlight.
It is smaller than a paperback to carry in your purse wherever you go.
Also, the lightness in weight of the device itself is another reason I bought the 6" over the larger unit.
Although, I did buy a clip on light for my night time reading.
Order it and you will love it, too!
I received mine as a Christmas present.
I have already read 4 books from it and have ordered three more.
It goes with me wherever I go and everyone asks me what it is, and of course I sing its praises!
It is easy to order your books online and they are right there on your device in a few seconds.
You don't have to run out to be bookstore anymore!
I love having the ability to enlarge the print as I really need this feature.

So this book is great.
Okay, I just turned thirteen.
My dad is a major Worry Wort.
I don't think boys will like it very much, though...
My sis is eight, and I'll give it to her when I'm done with it.
Hurt very much.
So it's good for every one.
No I'm not saying you have probs, but if for nothing else, It's a funny book.
I highly recomend this for teen girls.
So for my birthday, I get to go to B&N.
This book is just like my dad, only much funnier.
(I'm a book worm) As I'm looking through the teens area, I notice this book.
Ah, what the heck, couldn't hurt to take a peek, Right?
And my dad is pretty funny.
My dad aproves of it as well.
Wrong.
That is to say that I was Laughing so hard, I was sure my sides were going to split.
My mom was busting up and nodding her head at the same time.
I understand why he worrys, though.
The things he talks about in the book ARE important, and it is important to wipe the tears out of your eyes so you could read it.

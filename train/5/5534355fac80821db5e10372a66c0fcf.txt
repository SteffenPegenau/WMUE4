I do not see how anyone could rate this book any lower than a 5 star.
The way he lead you on with Sita's daughter Kalika.
The epiloge was a great way to end it with Seymour.
But the best book MAKES you put it down because it is soo good you can't go on for a bit.
As I young writer you are such an inspiration and I truly could not compare to your work.
Such compelling writing.
You won't regret it.
You have to stop and consider or reread what has happened.
You will never regret reading such a book.
From The Last Vampire to The Last Vampire 6: Creatures of Forever.
Oh book six was so moving.
He could not have come up with a better ending.
My compliments to Christopher Pike.
You have simply got to read his whole series.
My I have to say that a good book you can't put down.
I truly was moved.
The whole shabang of things.
And the ending.
Read the first collector's edition and then read this one.
The surprises around every corner.

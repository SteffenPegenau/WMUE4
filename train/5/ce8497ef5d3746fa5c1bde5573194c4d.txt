The story unfolds when Bruce, the author and narrator starts his learning about Australia and the Aboriginal people through Arkady, a Russian-born Australian with a thorough but not glamorous understanding of the Aboriginals.
This is his Work.
It is a book about all the above in no particular order.
An aboriginal rite of passage tale?
A historical account?
No.
Bruce is searching for himself the true meaning of the Songlines.
No.
No.
No.
Songlines is the story of the Dreaming.
A traveller's log?
By going to Australia, he understands, or does he?
An adventure in Australia?
By listening to Arkady, he learns.

Matty soon finds out that he has a gift, which is to heal.
Matty is in his late teens, but when he was a little boy he moved to Village.
This book is a very good book.
It was about a boy named Matty.
Will Matty make it?
The Messenger by Lois Lowry was an excellent book.
Before Matty posts the sigh up around Forest, Seer, the blind man who had lived with Matty all his life tells Matty to bring his daughter Kira back.
With a touch of his fingers, he can heal anything, except it takes energy out of him.
Forest has been hostile to people, but never to Matty.
I strongly recommend it?
What will happen to him?
Will his gift fail him?
Village had always allowed people to move to Village, but suddently the people of Village voted to close the borders.
He came from a place where he almost starved to death and was abused.
But now that he moved to Village, he has gotten over his past.
But when he enters Forest to deliver the message, he realizes that Forest is more hostile then ever.

Excellent purchase, and she loves using it.
High "Cool" factor in our community.The Kindle is easy to use, handy, convenient, just a fabulous devise.
!
I love it too.
Well, when she goes to the pool to sit and read her Kingle Books, there is hardly a time when someone doesn't come up to her and ask what that thing is.
She explains what it is, and all they can say is "WOW"!!
Funny thing is that, we live in a 55+ community in Florida.
Most never heard of a Kindle.
a good idea since it protects it from getting dirty, and I would think pads it in case of a drop incident.
God Forbid!
Hopefully, my Den will stop receiving bulky books that we need to find a place to stash.I also got her the leather cover for Kindle.
My Wife is an avid reader to the point that the Den is almost exploding with books she's read.
She hinted that she would love a Kindle 2 for her birthday.
Well, I got her one and she couldn't wait to use it.
Easy to read even on a sunny Florida day.

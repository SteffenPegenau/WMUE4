My history didn't start on no boat!!
But that track delivers, especially with the poem at the end.
Rock, blues, hip-hop and trip-hop on one cd, that clocks in just under 60mins and done right;?
He hasn't since train of thought.
E&A, Atmosphere, Necro, need I go on.)
(I.E.
Talib Kweli came through to deliver, which was a good thing.
The album is bangin.
I've always heard all the hype surrounding dis cat, but he usually appears to a lighter hue.
(I.E.
Amp's production is always on point, and they are never afraid to make music out of the box that is actually tight.
Once again, there is nothing to skip.
Amerikka, and Ow Lawd.)
They really are true to their craft and livin out the dream.
What really surprised me was track #12, "Poems 4 post modern decay" with Aesop Rock.

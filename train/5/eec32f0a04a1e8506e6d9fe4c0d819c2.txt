I did cardio all the time!
I sweat more doing this DVD than I did running 2 miles!
I just ordered the dance of the inches hip hop cardio blast, as I love Jennifer Galardi and truly believe in her methods.
I used to be something of a "gym rat".
Well, this DVD has changed that!
I am starting to see definition in my stomach for the first time since I was a teenager!
I worked out up to 5 days a week!
I'm excited about it!
Just keep at it!
I would lose weight, but my stomach never really looked good.
I will keep you posted on how the new one works for me!
Don't be frustrated if you can't get all the way through the DVD the first few times u you do it.
I practically lived on the treadmill and eliptical.
I fully recommend this DVD.
It's more than worth it!

Amazing track.
It would be easier to tell you what songs I am not into than the ones that I do like.
I like all but two songs on this CD.
This CD is not a waste of money.
Can't say enough about this album.
I think that is an amazing song, and I just assumed it would be the best track on the CD.
I figure, if you are going to pay money for a CD then at least most of the songs should be gems.
In fact, it just solidies the fact that the Timbaland/Timberlake combo is a homerun.
It is definitely a classic.
I WAS WRONG.
I am absolutely addicted to "Lovestoned" and it is JT at his best.
I was not a fan of Justified.
I bought FutureSex/LoveSound because of the song "My Love".
Track #2 and the last song on the CD aren't my favorites, but I adore everything else on the CD.
That was not the case with Justified (and it's a good thing I didn't spend my dough on it).
"Chop Me Up" is also great ("Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake").

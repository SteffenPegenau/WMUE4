Action packed, edge of your seat, nail bitter.
With that said, .
As a mom though, .
Okay with modern technology comes Hollywoods ability to make things grosser, and more realistic.
I mean heck its Morgan Freeman.
James was very convincing as the average Joe stuck in meaningless life.

.VEWIER DISCRESSION ADVISED!!!
.
Well, casted, beautifuly filmed, nice storyline.
This movie has no shortage of f bombs and other extremely violent and bloody scenes.
.
Angelina was very convincing assasin, Morgan, .
Very entertaining.
I LOVED this movie.
Not for the young!

I have not found any thing that I cannot cut, rip, or dato.
I have been using my Jet left tilt table saw for about a year now.
The fit and finish were beautiful.
It was worth it.
I spent about three hours putting the saw together.
I filed those down to avoid digging into a piece of priemo wood.
The only snag I hit was that one of the holes on the front fence guide bar did not line up.
Highly recommended.
It is a real work horse!
also the front corners on the cast iron wings were sharp.
I drilled and tapped a new one.
I love it.
One of the best shop investments that I have made.I paid the extra 25.00 for the fed ex delivery.
I primarily keep the combination blade installed for most applications.I would highly recommend this saw to anyone interested.
The saw is quiet and runs exceptionally smooth.I bought the thee pack of freud blades and also the 8" super dato cutter by freud.

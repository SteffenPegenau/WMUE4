90 minutes of fabulous entertainment!
Unlike some people, I never could watch a movie like Fatal Attraction and believe for one minute that Michael Douglas could cheat on Ann Archer and pick a dog like Glen Close to be the "lucky" adultress.
This movie will have you on the edge of you seat!!
Not me!!
Now Ben Cronin cheating on Shiri Appleby and picking Erika Christensen to be the adultress?
I can TOTALLY believe that!!
That woman is a feakin' bombshell!!
You never knew what to expect, and were always totally surprised with whatever she did.
She's also, in my opinion, a great actress.
Erika did a fabulous job!!
Utterly suspensful!!
Would you think that somebody who looks SO angelic could be a devious, murderous psychopath?
Seriously.
I just LOVED this movie!!
!
Ben Cronin also did a fabulous job of playing the unsuspecting jock who life crumbles around him because due to a tawdry one night stand.

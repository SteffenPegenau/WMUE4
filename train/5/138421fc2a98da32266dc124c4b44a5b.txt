It should be framed.
The stills take my breath away.
The artists have given them form and personality.
The story predates the series.
Perhaps they are easier to fight that way.
Dawn muddies the mythology and the back story.
It is a nice prequel with the exception of the addition of Dawn.
The artwork is extraordinary.
The monsters are real in the sense that we all have encountered them.
Bravo!!
The demons are very creative.
Angel in his birthday suit doesn't hurt the eyes either.
I love the use of poetry with the artwork.
However in this case it doesn't matter.

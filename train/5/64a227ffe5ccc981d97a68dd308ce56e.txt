Imagine hearing the unspoken fears and hopes of ordinary people as they make their way through life.
.
.
There are angels over the streets of Berlin.
The dignity of man is found is the simple hum drum existance of bleeding, thinking, loving.
This is what Mr. Wenders captures on the big screen.
Imagine a two hour dream.
Shot in black-and-white for the first hour and a half, but switching to vivid color for the ending .
The good and the bad.
.
.
Make no mistake, this is a masterpiece.
The simple joy of living.
when he finds his angel.
when Damiel, the central angel, falls to live an ordinary life of pain and, finally, bliss .

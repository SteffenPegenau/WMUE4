The legend that is Bon Scott along with Angus and the boys make every other Rock band embarrasingly ordinary .
If you die without hearing this, pray to God that it's playing in heaven coz this is the most phenomenal recording ever produced, trust me.
.
.
Gotta tell you all I'm now 34 and have been an avid DC fan since the age of 10.
.
Buy it, buy it, buy it .
This album is the ultimate in Rock n Roll without exception.
It's raw, mean, smutty, loud and massive.
.
.
.
Oh yeah, one more thing, play it so loud that your ear drums are in danger of bleeding.
.
You will NEVER EVER hear anything like this.
.
It's the best way .

Wake up!
The truth hurts.
This book is a very important counter to all of the liberal smearists out there.
No wonder they hate this book.
At least they report the FACTS.
Quit crying and get used to it.
You will thank me for it.
He points out how hypocritical they all are.
I feel sorry for them that they don't understand the God can save them from their depravity and ignorance.
They make fun of our president when he is leading us in the war on terror.
The people in this book are the REAL problem.
Open your mind, buy this book and learn the REAL problems.
They are protecting our country from terror and protecting us from immoral acts like homosexualism.
You lost the election.
They think that fox news is bad.
They say that religion is destroying the world.
They say that Bush and Chaney are unnecessarily killing people.

And he had some serious guitar chops.
Gary is fatter?Yeah, and?
It's Gary Moore!
I loved his passion,his attitude on guitar, his ferociousness.
In his hard rock heyday there wasn't a guitarist alive I would havetaken over Gary.
Gary isn't a great singer?
When I think of Gary I think guitar, period.
I saw Gary, twice, in his hard rock heyday, my favorite Gary.
Not Blackmore, not Schenker, not Eddie Van Halen, etc.
It's not a question of being better than those guys, I loved how Gary played.
Neither was Hendrix.
He played like the ship was going down.
When people think of Hendrix they think guitar.
OK, so I don't actually own this disc, yet.
Listen to his work with Colosseum II.I love Gary's blues stuff but his hard rock playing does it for me.
I'm sure this disc kicks butt.

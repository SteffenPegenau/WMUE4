Don't drop this one, PICK IT UP!!!
WOW!!
Believe me, that is not all!!
I knew the A-Teens were talented since their beginning and Pop 'Til You Drop has only supported my conclusion: these guys, Sara, Dhani, Marie, and Amit, will blow you away.
You will thank yourself!!
However, the album still carries that rambunctious, happy go lucky feeling to it that makes them what they are.
They sound so much more adult and they have grown up.
It is amazing pop.
Standout tracks include: "Hi and Goodbye," "Closer to Perfection," "School's Out" /f/ Alice Cooper, and "Cross My Heart."
What else is there to say?
!
I am telling you, if you have any doubts about buying this album, forget about them!!
Their vocals are smooth, sleek and tight and their music, if you're craving delicious pop, will be completely satisfy you!
I bought this album on the release date and all I can say is wow!
The A*teens have gone through a total maturation period.

If post-punk/mathrock is you're thang, you're never going to want to take this one out of your stereo.
This album is what rock should be.
Buy this album now - hell buy two in case the first one gets scratched.
even better.
I've had this album for a couple of years now -having been introduced to them through the Hot Snakes.
Interscope was a pack of fools to ever let them go.
.
It is like Coletrain, you can appreciate the mastery from the first listen, but the intricacy can only be understood after hundreds of listens.
It is simply one of the best albums in my collection.
Far better than the Hot Snakes (though I love them dearly).
Mark Trombino is simply one of the finest drummers ever.
It is a true shame that he is now only producing.
.
This album is like In On the Killtaker era Fugazi, but dare I say .
More creative, more on the ragged edge, pure cathartic energy beating your head 'till it is bloody.

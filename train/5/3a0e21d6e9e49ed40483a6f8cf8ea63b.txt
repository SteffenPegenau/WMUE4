the thing i don't like about it is the biography inside is in japanese and i can't read japanese.
the first single off it is "IT'S YOUR DUTY."
this cd gives you the BEST songs from both of the cd's, plus a bonus mix of cartoon heroes,the HAMPENBERG CLUB MIX!
the disc is enhanced and has the videos for CARTOON HEROES AND AROUND THE WORLD.
!
i have been fan of aqua since the start, they are great.
if you buy it you will love it, aqua may not be together any more but they still rock!
this cd is one that i can put in and listen too over and over again.
she sounds great on the new track.
the pics are rare and cool.
i don't know if the cd will be released here in th us, but it will be great.
enjoy!
the cover work and pictures in side are great.
the lyrics to all the songs are printed in the cover.
check this out, september 29th is the release of "PLAY WITH ME" the solo album from aqua's lead vocalist LENE.

LOVE IT !!!!!!
!
I LOVE THIS DVD!!!!
As an inter-disciplinary dancer, this did the trick.
If you are a beginner, take your time.
If you can do this video, you don't really need to purchase much else.
You should have some background or be prepared to study seriously.
It will come.
I don't think I can say enough to really convey my "devotion" to this DVD.
I learned sooo much and I have taken classes at FCBD.
I suggest you get this DVD and skip a lot of the rest.
The warm-ups and techniques were superb.
It provided lots of information and material.
I agree this is not for beginners or those unfamiliar with dance.
The techniques she shows also helped with other belly dance moves I could not get until now.
I felt like I could do almost anything after this.
I love this DVD.
I haven't seen many more DVDs that really cover this amount of material and so thoroughly.

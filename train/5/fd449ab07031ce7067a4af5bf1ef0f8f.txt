This is a very nice watch.
And its heavy.
Like u are wearing a quality watch.
Not too heavy.
This watch is the real deal.
It does it all.
If u r considering it.
But it feels solid.
And the bracelet is well made.
Also its rated to 200m.
Which is amazing in a flight watch.
Take my advice.
That depth is normally reserved for diver watches.
Very smooth chronograph.
It has so many features.
glows very bright too.
The Lum.
I can not believe this much value can be had under $1000.

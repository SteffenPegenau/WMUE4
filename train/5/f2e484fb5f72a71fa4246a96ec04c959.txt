All the reviews I read were good or great!
The pads were over ear, which is THE only way to go if you listen to music more than an hour at a time.
But for the price, you get a good deal on these.
If your still shopping around I'd recommend reviewing my top 5 against anything out there.
Construction was strong and of good quality.
You can buy less expensive cans but don't expect the quality to be the same.

I went with these because of a few reasons.
The frequency response was great (5-40,000 Hz), great lows AND highs.
Newer technologies usually have a better product, (usually).
I did a fair bit of research before buying these cans.
Audio-Technica makes some the best headphones out there.
Good luck.
And you can spend more and get more.

Oh, and look to see when they were released.

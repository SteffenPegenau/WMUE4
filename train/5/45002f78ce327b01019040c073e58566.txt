Like i said before the writter is very detaled.
Roll Of Thunder Hear My Cry is an over all awesome book.
I would suggest that eveyone reads it.
It is a great book for all ages.
It was not confusing at all.
So if you want a great book to read or just to give as a gift,Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry is the perfect book for you or anybody.By: Nica Elisabeth Taylor
He known right from wrong and knows how to behave.
If feels like you are almost there in the book.The book is sad and also very funny.
He is very grown up.
Young or old it dosen't matter.
How people whould treat people meanly or differently because of their race,even tho the slave thing was already over.
The writter explaned everything so beautifuly.
He also knows How to stand up for his rights even tho he is only 6!
The book is a little slow in the begining,but it picks up quickly.
The book kind of gives you a view of what it was like.
My personal favorite character is Little Man.

it took me 1 1/2 hrs.
This zoid is just about the same size of the sheild lyger.
THE 3 ARMORS FOR LYGER IS COMING OUT THIS SUMMER!!
Every1 that said 0 is faster than sheild,was right.I suppose it's because 0 runs on 2 batteries.
What's kewl about dis zoid is...EVERYTHING!!
the only thing that stinks is that it realy doesnt have any main guns like the command wolf or sheild lyger.
It also has adjustable boosters on it's back.
It was between hard and easy for building it.
(YAY)It also has pull out thingis when it does the strike razor claw.
All in all, this zoid rocks!
the armor can come off & he can just run "naked" O that reminds me...
Hey every1!
I cant believe i found a lyger 0!!
!
It has a small gun on it's tail, and on it's stomach.

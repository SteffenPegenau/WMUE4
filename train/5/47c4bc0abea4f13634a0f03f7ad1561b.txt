It was so inspirational to me.
The end of this one was satisfying.
READ IT!!
If I were to suggest any book in the whole world for someone to read it would be this one.
!
I didn't HAVE to know more.
I would love to have it go on but I was satisfied with the end.
I couldn't put this book down.
I have the greatest interest in joining CIA now.
I found that television was no longer interesting to me.
The characters were described so well that I felt as if I knew them.
I have only read 3 of Johansen's books but I would rank this one the best.
This book played out in my mind.
I have always wanted to do spying and such and this totally motivated me.
Johansen's mix of mystery, suspense, action and romance is incredible.

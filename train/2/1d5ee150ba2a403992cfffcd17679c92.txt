Not good.4.
The gate latching system isn't easy to use and honestly hurts my finger as the day wears on.
We were one of the lucky people that this DIDN'T work for.
It really doesn't serve my needs like I wanted since the stair option was out.5.
I have purchased several other gates and never had a problem.1.
If I could do this again, I would buy something else and forget about blocking my stairs (pressure mounted gate with foot pedal or something!
If you buy this, throw out the directions.
Your stair configuration must be PERFECT or this gate will not work.
Honestly, I wish I had sent it back.
First of all, I am not an engineer but am pretty savvy with instructions and installations.
I opted to install it in our hallway versus sending the gate back.
This gate is made of quality material but the hardware sent with it is crap.2.
When my small baby arrives, I will have a hard time juggling him and my toddler while trying to open this gate.
They are COMPLETELY worthless.3.

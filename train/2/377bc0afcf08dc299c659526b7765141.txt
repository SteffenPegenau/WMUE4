I don't remember them talking so much when I saw them.
This isn't one.
It's been years since I saw 'em though and I felt I might get that experience of a live show with "Live Transmissions From Uranus".
They ruined this album by running their mouths way, way too much onstage.
I couldn't have agreed more.
They don't even pull off their jokes, talking over each other and crap.
"Project Infinity", "Is It ... Man or Astroman?
I recall some jokes, but mainly them playing their unique blend of surf rock mixed with elements of new wave and punk, weird sound effects, and of course sound bites of sci-fi B movies.
Weird.
You know, Man or Astro-man?
I've seen this band live a few times and they [...] each time.
", "Destroy All Astromen!".
Damn fine performers.
has some great albums out.
Somebody actually yells from the crowd for them to talk less and play more.

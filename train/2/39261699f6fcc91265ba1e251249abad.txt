But there really is no reason for the problems listed above except for lazyness and greed.
There is really no excuse what so ever for printing this on newsprint paper.
The books are not even up to scholastic publishing quality.
On top of that, the books are physically ultra thin.
My son likes it.
Enjoy.
Shame on the author too.The story is nice.
There are fragment sentences, and sentences so poorly constructed that an educated adult writing for children could not possibly have written this.
While I read this book to my son i verbally edit all the rot out of the book.
Really.
This is my first review.
The first book is a grammatical train wreck.
Shame on you publisher for putting a book on such poor quality paper.
no kidding.
I use to work in the print industry.
Review of the physical product: The paper these small books are printed on is newsprint.
You shouldn't be paying more than 5 dollars for the set of 4 books.

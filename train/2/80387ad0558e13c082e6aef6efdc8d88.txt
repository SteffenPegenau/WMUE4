From the beginning to the end, only one expression on his face.
Often I think B/W is more expressive but in case of Kurosawa, it just make movie dated.
I like his style of exploring chracters and conflict but Throne of blood was just OK.As a movie lover, I prefer B/W.
last scene was the only scene I enjoyed.
Also, I feel his directing is kind of clumsy, pace-wise.
I was disappointed with Seven Samurai too.
How could they do that?
I haven't seen one...
Not well balanced.
Strangely, most of the movies by Kurosawa just didn't click with me.
Please do not throw a stone to me.Also, I didn't like Mifune's acting too.
Widely opened eyes.
Only exception is Yojimbo.
Mifune is cool, too!And is there any real battle scene really?
Check Yojimbo.

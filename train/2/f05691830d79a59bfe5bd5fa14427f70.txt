Money wasted, yes.
He played it one evening and that was it.
But, I'm glad he's back to creating on his own.
He is 9 years old and his friends love them, too.
They make up all kinds of stories.
My son LOVES Imaginext building sets.
Why did I let Fisher Price come up with his story lines and adventures when he was doing it on his own?
I also regret that Imaginext made a video to go with the toy.
Luckily, I think he found the software to be boring.
They are using their imaginations instead of playing video games.
My son begged for this software and I gave in.
That is what is SO great about Imaginext--finally a toy that will cause even older kids to leave the computer and video games.
Let the kids make up the stories!
Even the older siblings of these friends.
Within a few hours I regretted my decision.

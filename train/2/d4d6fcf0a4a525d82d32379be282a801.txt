Just Can't Get Enough is a story, I guess, about the creator of the Chippendale's, and his struggles with the man that took the show on the road.
This movie is so not good.
The creator has that man killed, why, nobody knows.
Their bodies are okay, but come on, that hair, and those mustaches?
Well.
Why?
And we get to see one piece of male equipment.
There are holes in it bigger than J.P. Pitoc's hair.
Who cares about this dreadful story anyway.
He can't take the competition.
The guy running the touring show was making his company a lot of money.
Well, no, the guys are dancing in the 1980's, and their hair is awful, and costumes are tacky.
And it's tiny.
Then 3 strippers break off from the Chippendales, and the creator wants them killed.
Good grief.
So with a movie like this, with no plot, shouldn't we at least see what we expect to see, some manhood?

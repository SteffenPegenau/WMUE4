.Tell Me, Tell Me.
I barely ever hear any of Lance, Joey or Chris.
I excpected a new sound for n'sync.
.
All of the songs are the same as the last cd!
Most of them were ballads (which I am not a huge fan of.)
I understand JC and Justin are the lead singers, but this is just my opinion.
.
The other boys need to step up front and sing a little more.
.
Maybe some more R&B; less OOH BABY more good music.
JC and Justin do most of the singing.
I only liked a few songs.
This cd was very dissapointing.
.BabyGirlfriendDo your thingInstead I recommend Justified by Justin Timberlake.
Recommended favorites are.

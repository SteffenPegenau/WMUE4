When I received this book as a gift, I was so happy and grateful.
Definitely not.
Will it put me off reading Allende?
Perhaps because Allende was trying to stay true to this historical character rather than letting her imagination take her where it wanted to go.
I'm sorry to say it about one of my favorite author's work.
Besides, she's entitled to a dud or two.
She's done it so many times before, she can do it again.
I read half way through the book hoping for it to get interesting.
I was so disappointed.
I wish her editors would have been honest with her and stated the truth.
I finally had to abandon it and picked up another book to read instead.
But it never did.
I couldn't wait to start reading this one.
Others, evidenced by the other comments posted, loved this book.
This book is just plain boring.
I have read many of Isabel Allende's books from House of Spirits, Daughter of Fortune, Tales of Eva Luna and others.
And who knows.
Maybe it was just me.

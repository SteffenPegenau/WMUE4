This book went beyond erotic.
What is really lame is that she accepts it as someone just told her that they had a cold.
I really thought this book was dumb.
Just one touch with Stephan and she sees his past.
Our heroine Ann Van Helsing is psychic.
I do not consider rape erotic in the least.
After reading the other books, I wanted to finish it up with Stephan's story.
She sees the cruelty of Asharti.
He did not seem to feel so guilty in The Hunger.
How does she know so much about the town since she does not mingle with the people?
Raping someone does not make them a warrior.
She sees his love for Beatrix.
Ann for being so alone and isolated seemed up on her sexual techniques and even sociable.
Ann even realizes that he is a vampire.
Susan Squires has some sick fantasies.
It was sick!
However, in this book, he seemed weak.
It needed more character development and oh yeah, a plot!
She sees the Daughters committing horrible sexual acts.

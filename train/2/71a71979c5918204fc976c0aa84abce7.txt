These may not be worth the $45.00+ for them.
What are you people thinking?
You can't prove it by this set.
I've seen bootlegs better than these.
Extremely dark.
These have to be the worst professional transferes I have ever seen.
Lucas / Spielberg are suppose to be the best in the market.
I love these movies but what happened to the contrast / color?
The stills on the covers are better then the movies.
I've done better transferes with my home movies.
Very Very Bad!!!!!
I played them on two different TV/DVD player combos cause I thought I had a problem.
This bothers me that someone of this talent would allow this to hit the street in this condition.
Is this a ploy to force people to buy the new remastered/redigitized/recolored deluxe set in 2 years?
Didn't anyone proof these when you got done?
Hold off buying this set until you have seen them and judge them for yourself.
I can't believe it took this long to get this garbage out.

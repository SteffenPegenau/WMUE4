Mine takes around 9.
I should have the maximum time, shouldn't I?
Mine added 4.5.
They said the charge time listed is not valid.
They said the video time will vary.
BUT keep in mind my figures above.
their answer is that times will vary.
Hmmm.
Hmmm.I may return mine.
I ran the video as a test, and did not touch the ipod except to start the movie again.
Not sure.
The iboost package says it will add 7 hours for video.
The instructions say it will fully charge in 4.5 hours.
It is nice in that is fits well (on my 5G), is compact and rechargable.
I called them.

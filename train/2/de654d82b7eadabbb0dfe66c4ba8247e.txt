Woman [gets mad] at the way the man behaves, man is confused why woman is acting so [strange].
Man is even more confused.
Repeat for several thousand pages to complete series.
The characters always have the same interaction with one another.
Why?
I read through book 4, but had to give it up.
All of the elements were there, great alternative world, facinating creatures, arcane powers and a battle between hideous evil and flawed good.So, what was the matter?
Woman runs to older woman for advice.
Older woman describes birds+bees and all is well again.
Woman gets in a huff and throws a hissy fit.
Always.
Sometimes the genders are reversed, etc.This was all fine for part of the first novel, but eventually you want them to just move on.
An excellent series with one big flaw.
Typical interaction involves a man, a woman and an older woman that the younger one can confide in.
It's especially jarring when a older woman behaves like a teenager in this formula.

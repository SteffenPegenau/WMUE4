I guess I answered my own question.
$$ spent on effects and sets.
Let it rest in peace!
I don't understand.
Why is the leader doing an "Aw shucks ma'am"/Marshall Dillon impression?
Pushed along by hopelessly cliched dialogue.
Recycled garbage at that.
Big name folks involved.
The sullen misunderstood teenager plot line has been done to death.
But the story is garbage.
You've begun with an interesting premise.
To them it's new stuff.
Who is the target market?
OMG, this is almost un-watchable.
There is no chemistry between the husband and wife.
How sad.
Okay... Well, I'm going to watch a Firefly episode to cleanse my pallet.
The target market are kids who are too young to recognize the cliches.

The lack of effort all of a sudden is easliy noticable.
It is no longer a fold out gate box.
Cosby Show deserves better than this.
I like to sleep with the TV set on a timer at night.
You can't do that when they remove the entire option like they did with this season.
That is a very bad decision if you ask me.
They wen't "cheap" on us.
It's 3 mini thin DVD cases in a slip case.
First, no funny bloopers on the last disc like seasons past.
Your collection will not be uniform.
Every TV show DVD should have that.
So despite this being a great show.
This season they have changed a couple of things.
Not that that's bad, but I hate it when they do that when earlier seasons were different.
Second, you can no longer select a "PLAY ALL" option.
Lastly, they changed the type of case.
And I'll play an entire TV show disc.

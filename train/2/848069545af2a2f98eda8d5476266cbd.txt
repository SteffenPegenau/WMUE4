But as he got a little older, he always seemed at a loss with what to do with his feet.
But his feet are dragging the ground.
(There's nowhere to rest them.)
Wish I had gotten something else.
Now he can reach the pedals (age 2), but hasn't mastered them yet.
.
It is very cute, and we always get compliments on it, but is not nearly as functional.
maybe it's just me, but we have had some issues with it.
This item is ok .
Secondly, the canopy and cup holder are useless, and our bike doesn't steer particularly straight, even though we have tried to correct this.
It was ok at first (age 1), because my son couldn't reach the pedals, and his feet just kind of dangled.
He would try to rest them on the pedals, and inevitably jam them with his foot.
.
I guess I can raise the seat up, but this still won't solve his dangling problem.
My sister's son is same age as mine, and she has the same problems.

I HATE THIS GAME.
Also it does not have any of the good things like in Sim City 3000.
!actully i can't tell you what to do so i guess this has changed your mind on wasting 40$ and alot of frustration.
First of all i do not recommend buying this game.
Remember Dont buy Sim City 4 buy Sim City 3000

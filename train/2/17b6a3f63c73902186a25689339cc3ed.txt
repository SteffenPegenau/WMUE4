I will now tell you why i don't like it.
But it was one of the most boring half hours of my life!
Well, thanks for reading.
But it's not even 3D!
It's just a 2D game where all you do is walk left and right.
As I mentioned earlier, I'm not big on creepy games.
I won't tell you any more of the plot.
Bye!
If you are, I guess you might like it.
As you can probobly tell, it's about some alien creature that's a slave in a factory called ReptuFarms or something.
Most animals in Oddworld (the would where Abe, the mane charecter lives) are extinced.
But, if these things don't bother you, i guess you might like it, though it's kind of old stile gaming.
And the controlls are REALLY hard to remember!
OK.
The factory makes meat out of animals.
So i just played it for like a half hour.
And I'm not big on creepy games like this.

I have never seriously cut myself until I started using these knives.
These knives LOOK fantastic on my counter.
They are not sharp at all.
I am definitely replacing these as soon as I move.
I was wrong.
My family has always used this brand of knives so I figured I couldn't go wrong.
However, the knives themselves are just awful.
They look sleek and modern.
I have worked as a professional chef and have worked with the head chef of one of the best restaurants in the country so I do know what I'm doing and have good knife skills.Secondly, these knives rust!
I guess no matter what brand the saying you get what you pay for is true.
I do not put them through the dishwasher, I carefully dry them, and they still rusted.
What kind of good knives rust?
The steak knives are very useful as letter openers though...
I was being very careful so I don't know what happened there.
I reach for the knives I've bought separately every time I can.

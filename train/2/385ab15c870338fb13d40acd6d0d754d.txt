There was so much promise to it.
James Marsden stars as a kid who's family moves to Cradle Bay.
This is an okay film that doesn't exactly make you think you wasted your time.
Where was I?.
Think of it as "The Stepford Students".
It could of been so much better.
But, if all else fails, there's Katie Holmes.
He soon realizes the good students at school, called the Blue Ribbons, are not what they seem.
James Marsden is too much of a jock to feel that he would be much of an outsider.
Bestill my beating heart.
It's always nice to see Bill Sadler too.
Sorry.
Sweet, lovely, adorable Katie.
The cast is all pretty decent, especially Nick Stahl.
It seems like there was more there than the final product we got to see.
This teen thriller could of been something interesting.
I've heard rumors that it was butchered in the editing room and studio people toyed with it.
I believe it.

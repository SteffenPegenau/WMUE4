Jedger Hoover likes rabbit code names.
I got bored.
Brilliant.
I got frustrated.
700 pages of short sentences, short words.
Short sentences, short words.
Only the kharacter of Jedger Hoover comes through krystal klear like the voice of Satan.
Keep a notebook to keep your rabbits straight.
All the konspiracies of the 60s wrapped up in one big novel.
I skipped pages.
Lots of n-word.
Wooden characters.
You'll get the idea.
Read a 700 page outline.
Lots of Klan killing, krusading, and konspiracies.
Worth the read for only that.
Ellroy writes quick and short.

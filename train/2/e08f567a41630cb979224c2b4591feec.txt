Why must things beep?!
And then there is the setup routine.
This thing has *microscopic* on/off buttons...on the back!
Why not print the instructions right on both units?
You turn it on.
I have to go find the printed instructions every time.
It wakes the neighbors.
What do you do with a digital thermometer every time you use it?
Mine stopped taking the temperature after only four uses.
Unbelievable.
It is really clumsy as a replacement for the simple "pen" style ones for use in the kitchen.
And the beep....oh, the beep.
If you buy one just remember: you only have 30 days to get a full refund.
And not in 2pt font!
I'm beginning to lose faith in Amazon reviews as this thing has quite a few good ones, but I found it to be really badly designed.
It syncs up, shows the temp, and then sits there and the temp never changes.

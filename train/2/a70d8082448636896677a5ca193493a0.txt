Nothing.
The dayglow sometimes glows during the day and you wish it would glow at night.
And this is NEW, out of the box.
If you shine a light on the glow paint it will glow for about 20 mins, and then zippo, nada.
In daylight, this watch is HOT.
Zippo.The reviews are true.
Like, not even a glimmer of light off a hint of steel.
When you wake up or go to bed, if it's your habit to look at your watch, you won't see it.
The alarm is way weaker than the watch looks.Too bad.
I mean it.
Looks perfect.At night, forget it.
Nada.
And I've heard flies louder than this alarm.
NOTHING.
It could be a perfect watch with actual luminesence and a shockingly loud alarm.

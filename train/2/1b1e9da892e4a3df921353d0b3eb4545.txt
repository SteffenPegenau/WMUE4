Because you know how bad gas prices are these days, and sine I drive a Hummer...Serj: WTF?!?!
i wonder how that convo went through with the band:Serj: Hey Daron, when we gonna get in the studio?
I need you to come into the studio tomorrow and do some backup vocals for me...I wanna hear SYSTEM OF A DOWN, NOT SYSTEM OF A DARON!
I wrote all the tunes and made sure my guitar and whiny vocals overpower everything else on the two records that i've decided to release at separate times to insure maximum profit.
What about the rest of-Daron: Oh, no.
Well, we're releasing an album.
As a matter of fact, i need your help.
dont worry about it.
About that.
!Daron: woah, easy.
In about a week.Serj: Wha?
Yes, Daron is a brilliant song writer and i think a musical genius, but why does he feel the need to not let any other member shine?
like i said, dont worry about it.
YOU DID WHAT?
I've got everything covered.
it's been a little while since we've gotten stuff out there...Daron: Oh, uh, yeah.

What an understatement!While the hero isn't much better - as heros go - at least Falcon de Burgh deserves some credit in dealing with the very annoying Jasmine!
What can I say?
Falcon de Burgh is THE FALCON.
he strikes her!Unfortunately, this is my first Virginia Henley book.
As the heroine, Jasmine spends most of the book changing her mind.
.
"Jasmine is a difficult heroine to like!"
.
Illegitimate Jasmine is THE FLOWER.
.
That is .
She is childish, she hisses, she snaps, she hates Falcon, she marries Falcon, she vows distance, she fantasizes, she wants, she changes her mind, she hates!
.
I only hope THE FALCON AND THE FLOWER is not the normal Henley standard!MaryGrace Meloche.

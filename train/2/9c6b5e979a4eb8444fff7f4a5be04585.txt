And, most importantly, Ms. Alexander needs to take a college course on how to write dialogue.
Don't bother spending the money.
All in all, very disappointing.
It seems I've read all these words before.
I keep trying to be optimistic about her, but this book finally sealed the deal.
I could barely make it to the midway point.
No more Victoria Alexander for me.
There's nothing exciting even lurking in his past.
Her male protagonist, Marcus Holcroft, is a dull bore.
But, the plot just didn't keep my attention.
All her books are so formulaic and cookie cutter.
Very ho-hum.
The main characters might have kept my interest more if they had some snappy dialogue.
This is the third Victoria Alexander book I've tried to read, and by now I should have realized that buying one of her books would be a waste of my time and money.
Gwendolyn Townsend, our female protagonist, is slightly more interesting.

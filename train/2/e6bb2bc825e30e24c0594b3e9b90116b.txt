But when one considers the tilting pan mechanism for measuring rainfall, this (at least to me) is not surprising.
A small amount of rain does not trip the pan, and may evaporate before the next rainfall.During the time I owned the unit, the display would periodically start to flash, for no apparent reason.
Why must it be so difficult?
I would not buy another one.
The comments about replacing the batteries are right on.
It did not help.
I'd replace the batteries (as mentioned earlier, a big pain), but it would not solve the problem.
They claimed they never heard of a problem like this.
I had one of these units for 2 years.
So this spring, rather than waster money on a new set of batteries, I threw it away.
This could go on for days, then stop.
I tried calling Customer Service.
I tried re-setting the unit.
Generally the unit gave reasonable readings, however very small amounts of rain did not record.
They were of no help.

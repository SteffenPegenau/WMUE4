I am disappointed.
I still can't "poo" but my husband will not be pleased tonight while I fart all over him in my sleep.
My husband tried it also and agreed it is like the taste of acid, and burns the throat just as bad.
After drinking it my stomach fills with air to the point that it is painful.
The taste is hard enough to get over, but it is not the worst part.
This product boasts its ability to regulate you, as well as to relieve stress and anxiety.
I have not found this to be true so far.
I got the original flavor, which I followed the directions while preparing it.
First of all, it is vile.
To put it nicely I'm lucky to "poo" twice a week, but when I'm stressed it is non stop.
I purchased this in hopes of getting some relief from my anxiety and also to relieve my IBS.
I bought this product, based on many positive reviews, and was not satisfied.
It sounds funny, but it sucks.
So every week is different.
I gave it two stars only because I seem to be the exception rather than the rule.

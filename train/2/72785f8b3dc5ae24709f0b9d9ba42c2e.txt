Why not focus on Hugo having to prove who he is?
Plus the plot to kill Queen Victoria is just thrown in.
And where are the love scenes?
What has happened to Brandewyne?
The Crystal Rose is a sad attempt at bringing back her art.
Some of her heroes were too abusive, but at least they had more dimensions.
And Hugo is so boring.
She used to write rich passionate romances that turned the reader on.
Oh, the eighties...
This is nothing compared to what she used to write.
And the claim that Victoria was seriously concerned with social reform is totally bogus!All together this book was a disappointment.
Hugo is so thin he waves in the wind.She seems to be attempting to write something Dickensian with the 1850s setting, but it doesn't work.
I don't understand what happened.
What happened to her deep brooding heroes who were scarred and afraid to love?
And the heroines had more depth.
I miss the old Brandewyne.
They kiss and fade to black...then nothing!

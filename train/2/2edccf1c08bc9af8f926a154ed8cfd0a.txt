When you have Errol Flynn, Olivia DeHavilland, President Reagan, and an outstanding performance by Raymond Massey, how can you go wrong?
It's grainy and dark in some scenes.
Just kick back and enjoy this piece of pure escapism.
And there are no extras to it.
It's hard to watch.
However, the tape transfer is horrible.
from our American history.
First of all, the rating I gave this DVD is based on the poor quality of the tape transfer not the movie itself.
Yes, it's not a historically accurate by and large.
I would recommend to avoid buying this Synergy Archive Series copy.
But who cares?
A western full of colorful characters set during the days prior to the Civil War with glorious names (e.g; Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, George Armstrong Custer, J.E.B Stuart, John Brown, etc.)
I happen to enjoy this movie.I would rate it 4 stars.
Let's hope Warner Bros. decides one day to restore this film and market it.
And really how many Hollywood produced movies are?

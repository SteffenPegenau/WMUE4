Bottom line....Don't waste your time & money.
What I'm surprised to say is why in the world did I continue to watch it!??
He came home laughing, stating how terrible this film was.
My son went to the theater and saw this movie because his girlfriend thought it'd be a good scary flick.
NO!
NO!
Am I missing something?
Okay- The Cabin in the Woods.
Biggest mistake I ever made.
Me, on the other hand thought that it probably was stupid and figured that most scary movies are any way!
!
Why in the world is this movie getting so much positive reviews!
Worst movie I've ever watched in my life!
So once again, am I missing something?
So I decided to watch this movie.
I sure hope Chris Hemsworth and Sigourney Weaver got a big paycheck for this movie!
What has this world come to!?
Was it going to get better?
I was very surprised to see that the great 2012 Marvel flick the "Avengers" director, also directed this stupid movie.
Was it going to have some amazing surprise at the end?

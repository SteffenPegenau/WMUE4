The man is a rock.If I had known better, I would have tried it out on my brother, the Marine.
In fact, I may try it out on him later, just for fun.Anyway, picture this.
I tried it out on his palm first and then the back of his hand.
I admit to being suspicious of this device.
He didn't flinch.
He would have jumped up and down for me.
Then do it again.
Use a tweezer to pluck out one hair at a time from your forearm.
Then do it again.Rinse and repeat.
Then do it again.
Then do it again.
Then do it again.
Then do it again.
Then do it again.
Why else would people start out saying things like, "It didn't hurt that much"?YES, IT DID.Before I put this anywhere near my tender skin, I looked around for a guinea p--I mean, my husband.
Then do it again.
Then do it again.

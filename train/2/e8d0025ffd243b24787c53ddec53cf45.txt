Yet I had to give it 2 stars cause no matter how much I hate the book, it did make me feel something and I did like her brother Quinn and his story.
I guess it was understandable because she was being abused but her loyalty to her abusive father was just sick!
I've never hated a lead man in a book so much.
Ughhh!
It was a pity fest.
This novel is so depressing!
Amelia is physically abused by her father and mentally abused by King through most of the book.
King is one of the most dense characters ever!
King almost gets her beaten to death and that is sooo UNFORGIVABLE in my eyes.
He is so distasteful!
Amelia was weak through most of the book and just got on my nerves.
I wish I never picked this book up!
I can't stand him!
It wasn't a romance.
It made me cry because I was so angry and felt so sorry for Amelia.

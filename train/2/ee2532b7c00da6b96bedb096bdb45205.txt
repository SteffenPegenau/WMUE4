Second: the songwriting is simply NOT VERY GOOD.
There are about 3 MARGINALLY good songs here.
(I hate Death Metal Vocals) Every once in a while the lead singer breaks the monotony, with clear vocals, but its not enough.
They are 90% Death Metal.
The drums are almost INVISIBLE, and the guitars sound like MUD!
BORING!
First up, lets discuss the vocals.
If this is your thing, you may be able to look past this.
Well, after much anticipation for the new release from KITTIE, all I can say is "What the hell happened?".
I've been reading endless reviews saying how this was MILES ahead of their debut, how they've evolved as a band, etc., but this is just a big disappointment.
Third: The production is weak.
I had hopes for these gals, but it looks like they are trying too hard to prove how "heavy" they are.
Better luck next time, KITTIES.
Slow, sludgy, downtuned riffs, with no groove, imagination or power.
This one is getting sold back to the record shop.

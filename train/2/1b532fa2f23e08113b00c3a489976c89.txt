This toy is a design flop.
Also, it CANNOT be immersed in water to clean.
You'll get water inside if you do.
I'm disappointed because I thought he would like the shape and be able to reach his back gums with it.
But I would not recommend buying it.
What kind of a teething toy is it when you can't get it completely clean!!??
Also it is a bit heavy.
Who wants the taste of plastic in their mouth?!!
The rattle is a mild sound and the twisty noise is nice.
Yech!
My nine-month-old is not interested in this toy.
Ouch!
Think: Mold.
He only tried that once.
The only positive things I have to say about it are: It is a good size.
It must taste like plastic to him too.
I think it is because it smells like plastic.
I liked the colors too.
If he is lying down while playing with it and he drops it, it falls on his face.

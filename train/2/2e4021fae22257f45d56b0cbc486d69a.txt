Color me VERY unhappy.
Which I'm NOT happy about.
That's 23% of the cost to RETURN it!
For me, a size smaller is too small.
No one likes walking around in wrinkled clothes.
It wrinkled badly in the packaging, so I would be concerned about that, as well.
I bought a size smaller, because everyone said it ran big.
Wish I had ordered true to size because now I have to return it.
So, I wasted $14 for something that didn't fit and I didn't like.
I left it hanging for over a week to see if ANY of the wrinkles would come out, they did not.BTW Made in Guatemala, if you're curious as to where it is imported from.For me, no more purchases from this vendor.
The cost to return is $6.95.
And I had already paid the $6.95 to ship it!
So, my recommendation, pass on this outfit.There is NO stretch to this cloth, so there's no "give" for bending, etc.
I read the reviews before I bought this.
and if it shrinks at all when washed, that's a real problem.

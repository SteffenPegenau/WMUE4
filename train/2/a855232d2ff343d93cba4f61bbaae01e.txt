It's not just the vocals; the music is flat too.
It sounded absolutely uninspired.
Another Hundred Years Of Solitude is easily the best track on an otherwise lackluster album.update: The fire is still burning.
Johnette is too talented to give up on, but who among us is perfect?
This thing falls flat on its face!
If you need a Concrete Blonde fix, but own all the other stuff, you'd do much better to pick up Pretty & Twisted(A Johnette project that is very worthwhile).
I strongly suspect the latteer.
It appears that Johnette & co. were finished after Mexican Moon.
I was dead wrong.
Being an avid Concrete Blonde fan & also a fan of good Hispanic music, I naturally assumed that this would be a can't miss cd.
!
I don't know if she's lost the passion or if it just took a holiday on this one.
I tried this one out for a while, but could never get into it.
I ended up givimg it away.
I saw CB in April of '02 and they were absolutely phenominal!!!

Very annoying and unstable.
You must put your fingers in the provided holes.4.
The knurls on the side of the lid are not sufficient to tighten the lid.
The highest humidity the display read was 22%.5.
When looking at the photo of the unit the rounded white handle topping the blue water tank is what you must attempt to set the tank on while filling.
Either the display is incorrect/broken or the unit cannot create 55% humidity in a 10 ft x 12 foot room.
Unit was received February 7, 20071.
A full tank in the same 10 x 12 room does not last 8 hours.2.
You MUST hold the tank steady while filling.3.
The maxiumum this tank holds is two gallons.I am disappointed.
This is NOT a 4 gallon tank.
This takes quite a bit of hand strength.
The opening lid opposite the handle must be tightened VERY tight or it will leak.
For the size of the unit I had hoped the tank would last for several nights.
This is an over-priced 2 gallon humidifier.

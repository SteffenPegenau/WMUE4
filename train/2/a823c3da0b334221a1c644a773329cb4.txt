But the toner is twice as expense as my Brother 1250 printer.
Brother is a good printer.
My Brother & my Samsung were printing side by side 2000 sheets.
The Samsung jammed way too many times (50).
Very quick & quiet.
The duplex feature is great for a once and a while duplex operation.
The samsung keeps printing faint copies and wasting paper.
My Brother 1250 & My Samsung blow away my HP Laserjet.
The Brother toner cost less and lasted just as long.
It's great if you don't print much.
The said they would sell me the repair kit.
The Brother stops printing when low on toner.
The Brother 1250 jammed only a few times.
The Laserjet is old but never made into the second cartridge before Goodwill got it.
It's a lot of paper moving for anything over a couple of pages.
HP didn't even stand behind it.

it just didnt seem right.
However, if you do love the books, i would suggest watching it just to see for yourself.
well i read SOMEONE LIKE YOU and THAT SUMMER.
Everything was really rushed, ans they only added the main parts, the sad ones, which made it a really bad movie.
Nobody was happy in it except for the end, and though that was happy it was slightly rushed too.
SO basicly, watch it, but i'm just warning you to ready for dissapoint.
I mean, Mandy did a great job, but the movie just wasnt good.
i was so excited to find out that a movie would b made of them.
however, i was kind of dissapointed.
I would highly reccomend A Walk To Remember instead, my favorite movie in the world!
I really wouldnt recomend it.
If you havent read the books you may enjoy it.
Some of the things i loved most about the book were changed.
it didnt do the books justice.
i am a huge fan of SARAH DESSEN'S books, i love them all.
Like everything in it was very morbid.

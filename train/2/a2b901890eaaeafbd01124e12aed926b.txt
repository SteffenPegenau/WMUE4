Nobody is negative towards other girls.
She may not remember what positive things happened to her at Catalina.
But for others, it might be the ideal school.
She may have only remembered the negative parts about Catalina, and not the positive ones.
That is why i gave her two stars.
I go to Catalina and i have nothing against it.
She also wrote the book long after she left the school, and may not have had the best picture of it in her mind.
Personally, i think the girls at Catalina are wonderful.
She was just trying to make our school look bad.
Maybe she just didn't fit intto Catalina.
I think that it fit me and maybe it didnt fit her.
At first i was not too happy at the school, i admit, but it gets better.
Maybe she didnt fit in, or maybe the types of girls that go to catalina arent the types of girls she hangs around.
Maybe it wasnt right for her.
She wrote the book well and she gave her opinion on the school, even though it might not be someone else's.

This was a present from my father and of course he feels bad too.
So I'm sending it back, extremely dissapointed.
That said, it's also crap.
I was so excited when I first saw the gorgeous chain and detailing.
Then, I opened up the watch to see a beautiful watch-face, considerately set to my local time.
I attached it again.
I couldn't!
This is one of the most gorgeous pieces of jewelry I've ever seen.
It fell off again.
I spent the next half hour trying to make it all fit together so I could just keep this gorgeous thing!
And then the back silver part, covering the workings compartment of the watch, fell off.
I clicked it on one more time, and then I tried to change the time to make sure I could.
Then the plastic cover of the inner workings and battery compartment fell off.
But I couldn't.
Unfortunately the 'limited lifetime warranty' means it's limited to fixing the watch if it stops running, not any of the rest of it.

I even read the instructions.
I gave it two stars because mechanically it works, I just don't think the product concept it as sound as it is made out to be.
So I can't do that.
Well my yard is wide open, no fence, hence the problem with deer in the first place.
I will get one of those motion detecting hose sprayers that amazon sells, that is pretty fool proof.
the logic that a deer will smell the scent, shock themselves, then be detered makes sense unless you have 4-5 deer that travel together.
The instructions say to place it at the entrance of your yard rather than near your garden.
Next year will be a better season..hopefully.
So I set this up.
I don't even know if I'm shocking one of them.
The unit takes 15 minutes to charge in between shocks.
maybe that's why it isn't doing it's job for me.
The shocker definately works, I tried it.
I just know that this isn't working the way that I hoped.
IF one gets shocked, there are still other deer that can keep eating my vegetables.

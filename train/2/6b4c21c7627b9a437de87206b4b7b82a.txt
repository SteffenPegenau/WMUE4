I don't have that much acne, just a couple of scars left.
The seller shipped them so VERY fast, they got here 4 days before the delivery estimate.
I think I read the same article as the person who wrote the previous review did.
I keep using it to try to see if, over time, they will eventually fade, and I purchased the product, so I gotta do something with it.
I read is almost like a miracle, and that the first application was the most drammatical.
This product could use a dispenser.
I purchased a couple of jars since they were cheap.
In the meantime, I'll keep on using them and wait a little more to see IF scars fade.
They still are there.
I have been using it for a week now.
Well....it hasn't done anything for me yet.
I like it better.
Some of the jars were a little open when they got here, there was not too much lost, but everything was greasy.
It works faster.
I still stick to my Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula.
It's a little difficult to apply from the jar it comes.

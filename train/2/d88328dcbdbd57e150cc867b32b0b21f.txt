megamix: BAD IDEA!!!!!
uninspiring and really awkwardly done.
it is sloppy and looks like a quick buck product from what is normally a great label: mute.
def.
will go down badly in fandom history and begs the elusive question: what where you thinking?!?????
get it on sale and avoid the megamix at all costs!!
you only get a couple of "new" tracks over pop:first20 and the bonus megamix is abysmal.
is this release supposed to scare the old and new fans away?
i have listened erasure for a long long time and this is a really really disappointing release.
using mark town's (who??
incomplete collection of singles: BAD IDEA!!!!!
!
if you see a copy and don't have pop:first20, you might want to grab a copy if you want a retrospective compilation.
a marketing gag instead of anything that has more to offer to die hard fans like me.
exactly!!!)

Someone HELP!!
That was about Dec.20.
I think I should be compensated for my time without a TV.
Is This the best they can do.
!
Like the previous person's review, we heard a boom and then no picture but sound was still good.
2010.
It has been over a month and they told me today to give them 10 more days.
We paid over $3,000 for this TV.
My Hitachi 55HDS69 was 4 years old Oct. 2010.
We are very upset.
He said the bumper or buffer board was gone .
My TV is still on the floor and I am still getting the run around about the parts.
We called Hitachi and they referred us to a technician.
It is now January 24, 2011.

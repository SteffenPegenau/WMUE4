You won't be dissapointed.
It really just made me mad.
It would NOT SYNC properly with my 360.
I had to have Walmart put in on a gift card, exchange with someone in my family and then go and buy it at Best Buy.
The First time I bought the Microsoft headset it worked pretty good.
This is really a piece of crap, and I do not reccomend buying it.
Still nothing.
I turned in on and off, let in charge for like 24 hours.
I actually bought it at Walmart and it's not great.
Go and get yourself a Turtle Beach.
The next few days I try'ed everything.
But then in use is started having syncing problems, and would not work properly.
For the price, I reccomend buying a Turtle Beach, but it has echo problems.
I actually lost my recipet, and I was really in some trouble.
I Highly DO NOT suggest buying this product.
As you know Microsoft has made some pretty bad products in the past, and this one of them.

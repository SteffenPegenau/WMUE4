You know who has to stop it.What a waste of everyone's time.
The animation is also poorly done.
I know animation isn't one of the more impressive parts of the Slayers series, but this OVA is particularly bad.
I have all of the Slayers entries and this one is tied for the worst with the awful "Slayers Great".
Like the other Slayers OVA's Lisa Ortiz isn't Lina Inverse.
You're not missing anything.
In addition to bad voice acting and animation, the story has been done already and has no interesting new characters.
Unless you're like me and prefer to own a series in it's entirety then avoid spending money on this OVA.
An ancient beast is unsealed and comes to destroy the kingdom.
This plot has been done before in the TV series.
I made a mistake.
With Prince Phil in Seiran.
I bought this w/o having seen it first.
Lina and Naga enter a kngidon that has been usurped by the dragon master, Marlene.
I love the Slayers series, but most of the OVA's are not very good.

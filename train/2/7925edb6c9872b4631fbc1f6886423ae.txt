The mix from the board sucked hard.
The bassist (Dave LaRue) is the best player in the group period.
But still, none of it rocks.
Plus, violin is not rock.
The violin is on the right channel.
Steve Morse to me wasn't as good as his band, but with the horrible sound quality, it's hard to be sure.If you buy this, don't buy it to be awed by guitar like with Satriani or Vai, buy it to hear the rhythm section.
The acoustic section is not lead guitar.
When Steve plays lead alone, the rhythm violin buries his lead.
This is jazz fusion.
All in all, very hard to listen to eclectic music.
It's all rhythm music, and gets boring quickly.
The drummer (Rod Morgenstein of Winger) is the 2nd best player.
I saw him play at G3, and he was better than Dream Theater's guitarist (John Petrucci) too.
I played it in DTS 5.1, and it was still bad.
I like rock.
Steve Morse is on the left channel.
This is not rock.
When they play dual leads, the violin buries the guitar.

Too many questions left.
Like there was no true beginning or true end.
How did it spread so fast?
How did the dead manage to live under water without being crushed by the presure?
That's what i did not care for.
The style is original.
There wee no main characters.
How did it start?
No one to root for.
It was just a bunch of small vingettes.
A bunch of seperate stories without a cohesive story line.
Oh well.
It was an enjoyable book but left me feeling like there should have been more.
I know that a lot of people like the style of the book but to me, it felt incomplete.
I enjoyed it but i do not think its great.
I started it once a few years ago and set it aside but The Walking Dead on TV made me pick it up again.

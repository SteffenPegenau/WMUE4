Even if you like racing games on the not-so-realistic side, this game still shouldn't be bought.
Vroom...Vroom..SHIFT..Vroom..Vroom..SHIFT.
You will not have fun!
This was a horrible game!
What the hell were the creators thinking?
Bland graphics, horrible gameplay, extremely unrealistic... so on.
Damn was I wrong.Graphics: 6/10.
So aggrivating it should be put on mute.Control: 5.5/10.
It is about a half second delay on any button press, and there is not any realism at all in this game.Fun: 5/10.
You hear cars shifting gears and annoying wannabe techno like music in the background.
Bad framerate and the graphics are TRYING to be good but fail which makes for a crash fest into walls because the colors are blurred and it's really hard to tell where you're going.Sound: 5/10.
In every way!
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
!3.7/10
I was hoping for a good old classic N64 game.
I bought this about a year ago at EB Games for about $3.00.
You got the idea.
The controls for the most part don't even respond.

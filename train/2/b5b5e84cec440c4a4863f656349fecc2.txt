(Not a compliment).
But I just couldn't.
Maybe if you're gay, or live in Pittsburgh (or both) this will be enjoyable.
I actually bought my copy of PITTSBURGH at a book signing, and met Mr. Chabon when he signed my copy.
The book reeked of something written by a (post)adolescent.
I found this book tedious going.
I mean, a whole chapter dedicated to two characters playing "Twister"????
Is it worth something?)
He was very articulate, well-mannered, and seemed a sensitive and nice fellow.
The language was contrived in its literary prententiousness, the metaphors and similes were contrived.
No matter how hard I tried.
(So I still have a signed hardcover, first edition copy of the book.
Otherwise, I can't recommend it.
Uh..okay).
(A porno mag drops out of a book at the protagonist's book store job, "like a severed arm."
(!!)
So when I opened the book the first time, I WANTED to like it.
(that did not further the story at all?)

And earphones that cost more than $100 need to sound better than good.Try the Etymotic Research ER-4P.
Rap.
Classical.
I owned these earphones for awhile (with amply time to break them in), and while they are a huge step up from the included iPod earbuds, they are not great.The biggest disappointment is that the fidelity of music is not quite there.
You name it.
Only they are also a $550 purchase.)
They are significantly better than anything out there.
They produce a significantly better soundstage and incredibly deep and accurate bass.
Jazz.
They produce good sound, just not great.
Funk.
ipodlounge has these as the top rated earphones out there.I listen to all kinds of music.
Rock.
(The only possible exception would be the E500, which I've tried, and they are indeed great.
I listen to it.
So having a good set of earphones, especially for airplane rides is important.Do yourself a favor and at least check out the Etymotic's.

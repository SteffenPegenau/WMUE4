Not to mention, what is the point in buying another part that will eventually break again.
So, it is not worth buying another rear wheel.
Then the bike stopped running.
It was not so easy.
BUYER BEWARE!
And once again the problem is the rear wheel.
It was easy to put on.
I will not waste my money on a Razor MX500 again until they do.
First we had to buy a new rear wheel that cost $50.
I thought that maybe everything would be fine, but today it has stopped running again.
Then we had to replace a control module.
At first, it was a great bike and a lot of fun.
I think that the Razor company needs to acknowledge that the rear wheel assembly is defective and fix it.
I got this bike for my son over a year ago.
I have already put almost as much money into the bike that I originally spent on it.

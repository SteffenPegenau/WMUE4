The few vocals present end up being glaringly obtrusive instead of welcome.
Get my Love (9:07)8.
Flying Song (4:35)2.
Violent City (5:23)5.
There are a couple of vocal tracks, including "Get My Love" and "Power," but for the most part, this one is more brooding and dark than you'd expect from a Circuit CD.
Rise In (8:45)10.
Twisted (4:04)7.
This disc is loaded with the type of instrumental stuff you hear when the club first opens, before the crowd actually arrives.
Power (5:29)11.
Also, there are some noticeable scratches and pops in the vinyl used for the mix at times.
Not exactly the kind of stuff you want to pop into the CD player at your party.
Not exactly a great inclusion to the Circuit Sessions series, but if you are looking for the harder edged, darker stuff, you might enjoy this one.
Love Divine (10:18)9.
You Won't See Me Cry (6:17)6.
B (6:23)3.
Higher (4:54)4.
From the bitter to the Sweet (8:06)
Track times are:1.

You want to meet this twins-girls.
I found this movie mean and boring.
This DVD is very different from the books.
And the movie is going the opposite direction.
And the first season was the last one.One good thing- sisters are pretty in the movie too.
I was dissapointed.
No wonder movie wasnt popular.
Just admire their beauty!
And a good brother.
They are interesting and kind.
And Jessica is just mean.
The movie doesn show what a wonderful parents sisters have.
Where is nice and kind Elizabeth who always protected Jessica?
In this movie Elizabeth is humiliating her sister, trying to teach her a lesson.
Each book teaches you a good lesson.
Very sad, because i am a big fan of books.
You want to be their friend.

No illustrations or graphic.
The Fusion of Science and Spirit (2008)" This DVD made the same way: it's made of interviews.
So whole movie is like blah-blah-blah...
But again there were no cross interviews with such as patients.
And again no proof presented to their philosophy.
The title of DVD says "... from " The Secret" and "What The Bleep Do We Know ?""
- But "Bigger Questions?..."
series like collections of words swinging left right and back from course of main idea.I would not recommend it.
There was only one unproved fact I found interesting that patients who received the donor's organs had latent memories of those deceased donors.
"Bigger Questions?..."
is not even close to these movies.
First one I bought was "Bigger Questions?
It's like an audio book.
If you make a move put some motion pictures God for sake!
I can talk like this myself especially with lullaby background music to lull your vigilance.

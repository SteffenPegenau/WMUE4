Greg just goes nuts and doesn't act like I'd immagin he would.
Were I nsa, I'd never have hired most of these people.
I like a good plot, I love good characters that move, flow, and adapt in a seting.
This book, while writen pritty well fails on most fronts.
Dave, the perfect companion to sexy Susan should have been killed!
The ending, the closure is stereotipical.
There is no sence of the events really hitting this cast of characters, no real aftermath.
Down to the write and the day is saves.
A good closure is the heart of any good novle.
She's frightened and acts like a blond bimbo.
The killer, like in so many books keeps f...ing it up.
Though things are simplified, and the nsa isn't as secret as he would lead us to believe.
:)
It's a great book when you're on the pot.
Susan reminds me of a chick from <fill in the blank> horor flick.
The only thing that's of some interest is the reader's digest historical lesson on cryptography.
One can't miss that many times if one is good.

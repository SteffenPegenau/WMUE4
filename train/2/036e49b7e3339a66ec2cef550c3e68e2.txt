but, man, this is outdated.
i find them over rated and way, way overpriced.
i have about seven criterion releases.
don't like my review?
margot kidder is good, but the rest of the acting is fair.
best line in the movie is when a woman yells about being institutionalized because of germs coming through her phone.about the criterion edition.
this is not worth the price.
you don't get much for bonus materials.
the shock value isn't there anymore.
does anyone really READ interviews on your tv?
i agree with some of the reviews about it being a tribute to hitchcock and rear window.
the soundtrack is great.
the movie, i feel, tries to balance between horror and some light humor and that does not pan out either.
by far the best company on the market is anchor bay, or blue underground.
check out the number of used dvds there are.
i rest my case.
hitchcock implied it, while de palma shows it, and it doesn't hold up.
great prints and extras.

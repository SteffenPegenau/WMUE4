Um...that's all.
Hello!
What is this, retrospective homophobia?
I also really, really hate the intelligence-insulting "translations" of British phrases.
Looks like whoever was writing the code for this page forgot to add the tag to end the italics after "IP"!
Even if, unlike me, you're not a devoted anglophile, these should not give you to much trouble.
Even if there weren't numerous blindingly obvious admonitions to such in many, many episodes, that woudl just be completely untrue.
Get real.
I mean really.
I'd do it here, but I know HTML doesn't show up in these reviews, so I guess I'll have to resign myself to it.
Come on, people.
Gah...One specific thing that bothered me was John Inman's disingenuous claims that his character wasn't meant to be gay.
Hmm!
I mean, it has some good information, but it is kinda smug.
Anyway, this really isn't a very good book.

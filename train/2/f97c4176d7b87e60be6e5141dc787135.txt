Where are the evil sorcerors and elves?
You know?
No magic spells of flight and invisibility here.
Dude, you be illin'.
Afghanistan schmanistan.
Why did you write about THIS world?
I don't see any love between an elf and a Bardic fighter!
Trapped in a world of disease and industry.

Poor little human!
I give it 2 stars because somehow I made it through the whole thing (obviously).
Dad croaks, and I'm still waiting for the demon Balthazor to announce his wicked presence.

I don't see any orc armies!
That's your final destination?

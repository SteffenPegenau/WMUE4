I do not like books where I am what I call "peeking in a private window" I don't need a detailed description of married sex.
I did not believe that Nicholas had a deep love for his wife.
The book had some very good moments that were not developed.
People get sex and love confused which is part of the problem in society.
It was not necessary and rather boring.
Married sex is a gift but it proves nothing.
I think there are too many people and too many authors who equate sex with love.
After Nicholas gets back from the war then we are fed pages and pages of his recovery in Spain.
The story was interesting.
Its none of my business, it cheapens the story.
The the war seemed a might endless.
The sex proved nothing.
I found myself skipping forward to the present.
I think if the non-sexual relationships between the main characters had been more developed then the love would have been more believable.
Too bad.

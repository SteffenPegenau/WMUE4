Man runs for it.
Man falls for and marries daughter of the house.
Colored her lips and face pale--the death-warmed-over look.
There is brief full-frontal, but the effect is spoiled by that ghastly face.
In the end, your feeling will be the same as the man's--Let me out of here!
Man learns BIG SECRET.

For two hours.
Did I hear you say the pace is slow?The filmmakers did manage to make Patsy Kensit's face look repellant.
I guess.
That's it.

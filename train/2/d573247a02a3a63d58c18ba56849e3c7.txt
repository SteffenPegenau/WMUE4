Hmmmm .
A little shocking really, from all the other 'kids' videos out there.
Shrek looked like just another video.
Obviously they tried to appeal more to adults.
I get just about any video that comes out for my 3 and 7 yr old.
Dream Works is is looking for a piece of he giant pie.
Well, it certainly isn't Disney.
Little songs that seemingly are about to end rhyming in words that most parents wouldn't allow their kids to say and at the last moment changing the words.
My suggestion is that parents should maybe preview this one themselves before showing it to young children.
.
The down side to the video - there is a lot of 'toilette' humor and innuendos that are inappropriate for most children.
.
Most parents expect a certain consistency in animated flicks.
The up side to this video - Incredible graphics.
The princess singing a duet with a bird (cute), but them the bird explodes and she cooks her eggs.

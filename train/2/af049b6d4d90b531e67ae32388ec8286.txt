The reason why no explanation.
The art is good and the fight is beautifully drawn.
Its not i say skip it.
Instead i get a story with absolutely no story.
It makes no sense.
It starts with superman saving lois thats good.
superman says that HE is weak and doomsday is still going strong.
Then out of nowhere they punch each other and they BOTH die.
Don't buy into the hype saying that is a epic story.
I read this book expecting to read a epic story of superman's death.
Then for the whole book he just kicks the crp out of superman.
No character building no strong story just him beating the crap out of people.
other then that i say skip this.
It is stated right before this happens that doomsday = strong superman = weak.
Then for a few pages you doomsday trying rip out off a box.
it just happens.
Near the end doomsday beats everyone.

THAT'S THE END OF THE MOVIE!!
In the year 3000, interstellar traveler Dracula is STILL wearing a cape and out dated formal wear.
Or a huge Casper Van Diem fan.
Hello?
You know, this movie had the potential to be good camp, but sadly, can't even achieve that.
What can I say?
What the hell?
Let's get laid, then BOOM!ARGH!Watch this only if you are really, really bored.
At least tell us they have some kind of force shield like in Star Trek!
Nah, even then, it's not worth it.
I mean, why the hell are they walking into a potentially hazardous environment with BARE SKIN?
ARgh!Then there is Drac.
Want more details?
The plot is lame, Dracula looks ridiculous, and the ending is incredibly stupid.
OK.Then the end.
Ok, as one person mentioned, it's the year 3000, and space suits are a mix of cheap gas masks and BARE SKIN!!
The robot turns to the only living member of the crew, mentions that in 12 hours they are going to fly into the heart of a sun, and offers to have sex with him!

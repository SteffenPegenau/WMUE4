Gary is a great singer, but that's all he is.
No, I'm not one of those "immature" VH fans who boycotted the new disk.
I am excited for the next release.
But, most definitely not five.
You can clearly hear the difference.
Maybe not.
I listened to 'Balance' the other day and wanted to cry.
Sammy was a great singer, guitar player, AND writer; a more well-rounded asset to the band.
Hagar was a great writer as well as singer and musician.
It's the loss of Sammy Hagar.
I don't think Cherone took part in a whole lot of writing on the new CD.
I bought it the day it came out, and I still own it.
But, it severely lacks the 'musical fullness' we experienced when the "Red Rocker" was still on vox.
Hopefully it will be a case of freshman jitters and sophmore success.
One star?
I wish VH the best of luck.
I don't think Gary Cherone is to blame for the failure of VHIII.

it's just five guys f***ing around in a studio, if you ask me.
i mean, it sounds (and reads) like they spent an hour max working on the lyrics and arrangements.
they sound terrible by today's mastering standards.
i played two or three times through the first day and that's it for me.
they just don't have it in them anymore, i guess.
it's even blander and less remarkable than HITNF.
i was really hoping for a return to the glory days, a la the RFO through Empire days.
man, this album goes absolutely nowhere.
i don't want to "accept" or "learn" to like the new QR.
oh well, we'll always have those old gems.
i didn't think that would be possible, to be honest.
my last request to this band is this: please, please, please remaster O:M and RFO!
but i'll take 'em as is any day over this tripe...
while HITNF has its moments ("The Voice Inside", "You", and "Saved" come to mind), this album has nothing worth mentioning.
i want good, melodic hard rock.

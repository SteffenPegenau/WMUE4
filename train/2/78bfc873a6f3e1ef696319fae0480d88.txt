Embarassingly shows.
But everyone I guess has their 15 minutes of fame.
She'll always be second rate and pales in the shadow of Celine but I guess that's as far as she will go.
Let's be clear here.
She steals from Celine like crazy, even the gestures, breathing, and emotives.
She's not original or talented enough.
Well where do I start.
Celine rip-off.
Her voice is not as refined or powerful and huge like Celine's.
But she can't pull it off.
Celine wanna-be.
Shall I go on.
She's has nothing that could catapult her into the world of super stars.
Celine imitation comes to mind.
The thing is I really thought she had one original bone in her.
Turns out she tries too hard to copy other artists and it shows.

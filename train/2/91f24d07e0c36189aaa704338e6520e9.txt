I tried to like this movie though and Cedric the Entertainer is very talented and funny when he is given decent material to work with.
I was very skeptical about this movie to begin with, not because of the cast.
It would be the same as some director doing a Three Stooges remake.
A remake given it's proper due of this series is pretty difficult material to tackle.
Some things just shouldn't be done over or dug up again.
The casting was perhaps the only good thing.
It would've helped if it was funny.
To make it funny for today's audiences seems next to impossible regardless of what ethnic group or race the actors are.
It's just not as funny as it once was.
And they didn't seem to be having fun in it either.
The Honeymoners is an ancient show to begin with.
It seems like these highly talented actors were misplaced in the wrong movie.
The audiences of today have high expectations often to a fault.
This unfortunately wasn't it.
In regards to this film.

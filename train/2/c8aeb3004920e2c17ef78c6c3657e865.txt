Even in the house, I can hear it from 1 floor away.3.
We thought it would make a great gift for the holidays.
I started the first stage three days ago and I've had to nudge it 10 times.
Here are the cons:1.
The machine has a tendency to "stick".
The tumbler stops tumbling and you've got to nudge it to get it going again.
(Weak motor)I might be persuaded to recommend this product if not for the weak motor.
Let me emphasize: the machine has to be running almost constantly for 17 days (minimum).2.
Then we read the instructions.
Bought this for my 5 year old nephew.
I would not buy this is if I lived in an apartment.
When running, the motor and the assembly are noisy.
This can only add time to the process.
(Noise)The polisher consists of a sealed container mounted on a gyroscope run by a motor.
(Time)There are 4 stages to polishing and the whole process can take 17 days.

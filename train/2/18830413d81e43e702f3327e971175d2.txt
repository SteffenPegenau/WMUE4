This book was just basically about affairs.
This novel is about a man named Nick that lives next to Gatsby, who throws parties at his mansion every Saturday.
I felt like nothing really actually happened in the book.
Also the actual writing was way too eloquent and he used lots of big words, that was distracting from the actual plot.
I felt like the novel was too boring, and dull.
I also didn't like how Nick was narrating it, because he wasn't a sole part of the plot.
The 1920s was fun and exciting, and this novel was not.
His writing was way to flowery, which made it unenjoyable.
He then befriends Gatsby.
It was really hard to get into.
There wasn't really a plot.
This book is supposed to be a reflection of the 1920s, but doesn't really exude it.
He was just there; nothing important.
In the beginning of the novel, it was confusing when Tom showed Nick, his mistress.
The novel, The Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald is not a book for me.
I don't understand why this is a classic...

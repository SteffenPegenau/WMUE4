Why not make it fictitious?
But - hey - how much?
How about the "Central Park bomb"?
He must have thought his characters needed - well - character.
500 pages of waiting and wanting to understand why this thing won a Nebula.
So he heaps day-to-day ennui upon ennui.
So Gregory Benford is a physicist himself.
His details of his characters life becomes ponderous, while his details of what should have been interesting were scant.
I can appreciate a scientist dousing a sf story with mounds of science.
Great!
The Kennedy fictionalized assassination went on for pages.
(only one mention).
Then it was followed by the vaguest hints of JFK's recovery and continued presidency.
BIG DEAL!!
And for story?
Except for a really GOOD idea of a time traveling Morse coded message where was anything outside of ORDINARY?
Was he paid by the word?
This is FICTION.

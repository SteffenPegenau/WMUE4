Can't download in any fashion but Itunes.
iPod developers made better plan for hooking up the consumers than providing a reliable product.
Keep you in their pocket--can play only from their Itunes, better performance on MAC than PC.
Great idea, the iPod, but poor "performance" testing.
Was lucky .

Looks are deceiving.
Therefore, buy cheaper disposable MP3 player, spend the difference on beer.
Expensive disposable device it is.

Only MP3--no WMA.
Kinda like computers, the iPod, in that, they got you coming and going--sell you the poorly performing device, then sell you the fix of the device.
Attracts attention of criminals as well as envy and admiration.
Checked it out first.
Thought to buy one.
Mega problems for the price.
Normal humans can't replace the battery.
my son got one.
I got in on the evaluation.

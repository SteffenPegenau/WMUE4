on the same CD?
The only reason I give this album two stars instead of one is that Carlos is a great musician and great guitarist and he had an amazing performance at woodstock.
So, Santana is proclaiming himself a Shaman?
Don't be so pretentious Carlos please!
Come on!
I guess that those ten or so grammy awards for his last album went to his head.
Some kind of holy man or something?
Supernatural was good because he chose other musicians thoughtfully, but Placido Domingo and P.O.D.
But, this is total [baloney]!
And there is no need for Santana to become pop.
So avoid this one.
Why does he feel that he has to bring in these other artists who can only hurt his music?
There is no need to make another Supernatural.
I know Carlos could do better than this with his own band.
Carlos needs to go back to writing good music with his own band instead of doing a bunch of collaborations with artists that don't deserve to collaborate with him.

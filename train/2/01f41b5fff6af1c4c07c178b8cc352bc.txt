You really feel the workout.
I wasn't impressed with Tracy in this video at all.
The instructor in this workout explains each exercise and works at a good pace.
I'm addicted to this dvd.
I ordered this dvd after seeing her workout on the Oprah show.
She goes right into each exercise without much explantion or example.
I didn't find anything funny about the workout.
She seems to almost be lauging at someone in the backround through the workout.
I was sore the next day, so it did work my muscles.
It is a hard workout to do.
This workout is not for beginners.
It makes you feel so good afterward.
Really kinda ticked me off.
After beinf disappointed in this workout I did some research and decided to order The Bar Method and I really enjoyed this workout.
I am not cordinated AT ALL and there are some moves that are rythm or danced based which I found difficult.

NOTHING!
I think the most impressive thing he did was come up with a fresh take on the Joker after several famous portrayals.
Ledger was good, really good.
WHAT WAS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS FILM?????
That is the best they could do?
Really???
Ohhhh... sometimes good people go bad.
This is one of the most over-hyped movies I have seen in a long time!
At all!
And what was up with the excessive makeup on some people?
But "Best Actor"????
It had a lot of action, but was SO OBVIOUS what was going to happen, there was no suspense.
And the "Raspy Batman voice" was REALLY IRRITATING!
Was this movie sponsored by MAC Cosmetics?WAY OVERRATED!
The movie was cliche cliche cliche!
NOTHING new or inventive.

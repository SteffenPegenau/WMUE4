Is he saying, "How are you?"
Big mistake.
Everything is transliterated.
But as a language book I would never recommend it.

This one factor made the book worthless to me.2 - No where in the book does it say what is being said on the CD.
I have no idea!
I have purchased a number of Dummy books and have found them quite useful.
"On the plus side, the book has a lot of useful information about Israel, customs, etc.
I have 2 major problems with it.1 - In chapter one it briefly covers the Hebrew alphabet and the pronunciation of consonants and vowels.
I can understand the use of transliterations for Japanese or Chinese since they have thousands of different kanji's.
No more Hebrew in the rest of the book.

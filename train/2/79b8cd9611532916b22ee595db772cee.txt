There is this really generic time line.
Warning spoilers!
But you can tell that there trying to make it so dramatic but it was like in the third or fourth chapter.
Then really all that happens was she was just getting food so she can survive and befriending animals.
But then at a point it just droped.
Like in the beginning the main character's dad dies in a really dramatic way.
Like really it would be like another spring went by.
So ya I highly don't recommend this book.
But they barely had any character development with him so you don't really care.
This book is just not that great.
Some of it is interesting but some of it is not.
No I am not kidding that is how it was.
It is at some parts that are good but the rest is just not.
But then after the main girl gets stranded on an island it starts to get good.
An entire season would go by in a sentience.

My advice is to try somebody else.
I too, have also hit the Cingular button and been connected to the internet..and billed for it!
Very unreliable service.
Sometimes it charges; sometimes it doesn't!
Tons of dropped calls.
The phone first; I can't see the screen outdoors!
I don't like the phone and I don't like the service!
Try punching in a number with the speaker on!
I switched to Cingular from Sprint because of the increased national coverage.
Non intuitive menus.
It doesn't work in my girlfriend's apartment in Cranford NJ.
And why do they make it so hard to get a rebate??
You can only press the number buttons so fast.
I live 10 mins from downtown Philadelphia.
A few more onboard ringtones would have been nice too.
As for the service; The phone doesn't work in my apartment.

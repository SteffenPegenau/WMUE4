So many quirky little details, doing nothing, going nowhere.
Her characters were driven forward by the theme, the core of the story.
Unlike Mr. Wilcox's.
But no, that was just another false lead, in a book full of them.
I kept waiting for a point.
One of billions.
It's just another quirky, funny, little, meaningless detail.
For example, at one point, the characters are talking and a dog walks up on the porch to sniff around, as it does every night.
Only sometimes.
I thought perhaps I caught the whiff of it for a while: submerged gay life in a Southern town.
Yes, they were quirky and irritating.
There's no point to the dog, no reason for it to be in the story.
But to her credit, she had a point, a purpose.
Enough to drag any plot to a dead halt.
But they served a larger purpose.
And that's it.
Period.
Yes, they were funny.

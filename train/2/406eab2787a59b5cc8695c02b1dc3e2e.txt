It would have also been nice to have had more info in English.
BUT, it left my hair feeling stripped and tangled.
Everything is in French.
I just recently decided to go completely gray.
I would hate to see what it would do with long hair.
It is very liberating and I love the color, which is white rather than gray.
I am a 52 year old female with moderately coarse, wavy hair.
My hair is NOT long.
Maybe it just doesn't work for my hair type.
I am going back to the Wen Hair System.
It may work fine for you, but for me, I have a bottle that I can't use.
But then I am weird in that I like to read everything about it.
Of course, it comes from France, so why would I expect English?
It was creamy and smelled good.
I ordered this and tried it for several weeks.

Other than that it is ok.
If you also skip to another song, the skip memory starts from 0 then works it's way to 40 sec of protection.
This cd player is ok, but for the money it is not.
Also the skip protection does not work at all if a CD-R or a CD-RW is played.
It is quite big compared to other CD players.
What is bad about memory is if it is set to 40 sec, it takes 40 sec for the protection to be full.
One other thing, it does not play CD-Rs or CD-RWs with the same quality of music as a regular cd.
It has anti-skip MEMORY, not protection.
That can really become annoying.
Thanks for reading.
One plus is the headphones, they are good and comfortable.
The other good thing about this player is that it also looks cool.
If it is shook at 5 seconds after it is set, it skips.
First of all just because it has 40 sec.
anti-skip protection does not mean it is good.

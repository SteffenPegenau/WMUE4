Well lets start with the create a player mode.
I mean the moves are really hard to pull off.
This game is terrible!
The commentary is pretty good.
But im warning you whatever you do DONT GET THIS GAME!
Well maybe the best part of the game is the soundtrack.
I cant believe EA tried to make this game.
First of all the conrol is aweful, terrible.
They are way to short.
But with the poor graphics and bad gameplay makes you think you are at a circus.
I mean whatever I do it loads.
I have one word to describe this mode.
They were poorly done.
Its also way to short.
Now lets talk about the gameplay.
The graphics are OK but they could of been alot better.
If you are looking for a good wrestling game get wwf attitude or wait for wwf smackdown to come out.
You can hardly chose anything.
The loading times are really slow.
And the cheers and the grunts makes you think you are right at the match!

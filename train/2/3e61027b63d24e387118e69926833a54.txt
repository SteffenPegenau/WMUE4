Sorry, but this one made it's way to my shelf of stuff I don't listen to
After reading a lot of these reviews, I am kinda surprised.
I know it shouldn't be compared to Tool, but Keenan's voice is so distinctive you can't help but consider it.
.
.
It doesn't have the depth of, say, Aemima.
no real rises and falls, no climax.
I had hoped for a continuation of Keenan's incredible work in it.
am I the only one who absolutely loves Tool and can't see it in this one?
The music just seems bland, for lack of better words.
.
First of all, I must say that I got this album after hearing rumors (untrue ones) that Tool had broken up.
.
you can jump to any part of the song and hear the same sounds.

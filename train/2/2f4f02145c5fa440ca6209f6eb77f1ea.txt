Janey is only a 13 year old teenager.
Such an adult male (or female) is clearly breaking the law.
It is also bizarre that I am the sole reviewer to point this out.
The story line takes place in New Zealand.
This dysfunctional family seems doomed.
Will matters finally get out of control?
Perhaps the people associated with the American TV program "To Catch a Predator" and "Perverted Justice" should visit this country.David ThomsonFlares into Darkness
"Rain" is morally bankrupt.
Is she capable of handling this responsibility?
She is indeed rather mature for her age.
The father is being played for a fool.
And no, I'm not even slightly exaggerating.
Janey is the daughter of a woman who is selfish and undisciplined.
Nonetheless, Janey is too young to legally allow a fully grown man to have sex with her.
This is a film that literally sees little wrong with child molesting.
Janey's younger brother needs her love and protection.

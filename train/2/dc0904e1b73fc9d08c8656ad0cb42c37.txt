Only if it was offered on Amazon Instant Video for 99 cents or free on Netflix.
Hard to believe this film made over $100 million dollars.
We deserve better!P.S.
Alex Pettyfer played his role ok. Matthew McConaughey fulfilled his obligation looking spectacular I might add.

After all, a few of my female co-workers stated, "Everyone in the theater was screaming!
Women/Gays!
However, for some reason, I kept thinking about Chris Brown during his dance performances.
Channing Tatum was in fine form.
Sorry Adam.
The rest of the cast was under used.Would I recommend Magic Mike?
The floppy bums on one of the dancers was quite laughable.
I watched this film expecting to scream my head off.
"I was bored.

So, I decided to try it out.
No depth.
Third, if you die (like I did) and you didn't save your game recently, you basically have to start over.
Boring, a little too complex, and very THINK FAST!!!-ish...
BORING!!!
This is one thing I wish they had used a little bit more in the Kingdom Hearts games.So, yeah, I've played it.
Last, all you do is walk a little, fight a little fight, walk a little more, a little cutscene...
I am a die-hard fan of Kingdom Hearts, and I've heard the fantastic reviews for Final Fantasy.
I rented it at the video store, and boy, what a waste of time!First off, the storyline is just plain lame.
No interest.
Nothing.
I won't be playing it (or any of it's relatives) again.
Second of all, the battle system was just kind of bizarre.
I hate it.
The only props I can give this game was amazing graphics!

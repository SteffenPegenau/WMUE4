I'm depressed.
Life sucks.
Heaven was beautiful.

I'm in pain.
It's like his experience in heaven was used to sell a book that's mostly about his misery in recovery.
I wish I'd never come back.
Life sucks.
I'm depressed.
The book went in a cycle of "I'm in pain.
I'm depressed.
Oh, but heaven was beautiful.
Oh yea, I have a wife and a few kids that I barely mention.

I bought this book after the reading some of the great reviews of David Eddings.
I don't know.
Martin for anyone looking to start a fantasy series
I just can't figure out why this book got so many great reviews.
Instead I would recommend George R.R.
This plot just went over and over.
I found this book to be a bit pointless.
So he gets angry constantly at his Aunt and others.
Maybe I missed something.
This was the first book I have read by Eddings and so far I am not very impressed.
I had to force myself to finish the book.
There was not any great plot.
A boy trying to figure out who he is.
Nobody telling him much.
And even by the end of the book he still does not know much.

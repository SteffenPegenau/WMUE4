It's possible to make a good FM Transmitter.
I look for a random station with nothing on it.
It's like listening to AM radio.
It doesn't work well enough for it's price at all.
I'm in the suburbs, in New York.
?We, the people who just don't want ipods cannot win, can we?I bought the Belkin FM Transmitter for the Zune.
If only they'd make one for the Zune.Don't bother with this one.
Power lines are everywhere.
Theirs work great.
Look at iTrip.
I unscrew the antennae from my car (not all cars have these, I got lucky), and I get much better reception.
God forbid the album you're listening to was recorded before 1987 or has a lot of cymbals.
I can hear the music, but there's static over the music.
.
I try the default stations, nothing but static.
.
.but only for SOME music.
We can't win, can we??
You'll just hear a bunch of noise.It's really a shame.

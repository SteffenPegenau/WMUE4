I bought a DVD copy.
The DVD is a basement copy.
The DVD from VHS will leave you badly needing vision correction.Don't waste your time or money.
Maybe even Blu-ray.
About 25 lines of resolution.
It too sucks!
But I am not holding my breath.
I keep hoping for a REAL release of this most interesting film.
The DVD copy is from a VHS original.
There is an OFF air copy out there too.
The film may not be star wars but it deserves better than this.
VHS on its BEST of all possible days was CRAP.
I have seen this movie.
It is like trying to watch it through an old coca cola bottle.
You MAY be able to snag a Betamax copy which at least would be viewable.

I could see him taking Grace and Pilgrim to Tom Booker instead of Annie, however, we couldn't have had a love story with the horse whisperer.
Annie was never a really likeable character.
They made the movie.
The casting of Robert and Grace was excellent.
The scenery is beautiful and the story is sad, haunting, beautiful, and unforgetable.
I could have easily watched a longer story.
Redford and Thomas had absolutely no chemistry.
Her only redeeming characteristic was her love for her child and that only came out after the accident.
Robert was a much better parent and more likable person.
I read the book after seeing the movie.
In the book there was not a great age difference and it was handled much better.
The romance part of the movie was never believable.
The book was so much better than the movie
I didn't mind the length of the movie.
The plot became much clearer after the book.

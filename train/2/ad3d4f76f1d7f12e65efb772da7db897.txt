I dislike the fact that the volume controls and what not are shared with the F keys.
The design is not good for traveling.
I also paid for the 3 year warranty, and I turned it in to get it fixed after it had fell (that was my fault).
Not a bad product overall, just has flaws.
The screen is separated from the frame at the bottom.
I don't recommend this to anyone.
I even got it on sale at Best Buy.
My sound did not work after I got it back, when before that I did not have a problem with it.
I really don't like my laptop after two years.
Compared to cheaper laptops, this is definitely not worth the price I paid.
I learned that from personal experience.
The webcam picture quality is not that great.
Let me just say that the Geek Squad did not do a good job at the repair of it.
I was not an experienced buyer then.
The fan is noisy, and the laptop itself gets really hot.
For some reason I didn't get any back-up discs with my initial purchase of the laptop.

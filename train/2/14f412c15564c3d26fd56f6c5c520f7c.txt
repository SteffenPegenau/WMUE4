If I were Amazon, I would not use this distributor.
Was sewing satin material.
The bottom line is I have to send the machine in (my dime) if they find out that there is a malfunction; I still have to pay $69 for service.
CS agent told me the wrong needle was used.
Because POLICY states that the machine has to be serviced 1 time per year.
How does she know?
Unreal.
I would recommend purchasing another brand name from Amazon.com.
Even though I have used the machine only 2 times.
The distributor in US no longer works with Simplicity.
Used the machine 2 times, on the second time, the bobbin thread will not go through the needle.
Called the distributor (thought was manufacturer) No help.
Simplicity is outside of the country.
And why I asked?
Their customer service does not meet the Amazon.com standards.

When I asked him which was the main circuit board (there are three) he responded "the MAIN one."
When I spoke to "Mike" he treated me horribly.
Let me first say that the key pad works.
Get a different brand gate opener.
Guess what no call back on Monday.
I asked him not to be rude and he got even worse.
The first two techs I got were great.
When I asked to be transfered to a different tech he said that was impossible.
I called customer service because I had a question about installation.
He said "It's the MAIN one."
When I asked to speak with a supervisor he told me that his supervisor wasn't there and would return my call on Monday.
When I asked again which was the main one.
It functions correctly.
He told me to look at the main circuit board.
(Yeah Right) I would not buy this product from them their support team needs some SERIOUS work.
I am not an electrician or a professional gate installer.

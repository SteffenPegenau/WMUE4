Let Me just say that this man will never be 2pac and therefore there is no comparison.
It was always hard listening to that man's song.
Even though you is from the east coast you can still admit that pac is better cuz its the truth pimpin.
Oh yea some creative master at work.
Ive said my piece west side till I die.
You fools on the east coast just jock him cuz he was the closest thing to pac at that time.
What is that?
Anyway, ready to die was an ok album but go cop some of pac's [...].
You listen to this album they aren't bangers.
2pac broght the hood [...] into and the concious rap.
Every joint is a banger.
Track 12 he talks about him and his bi*tch.
I'm sorry but I had to give this man 2 stars.
I think Jay-z is harder than big.
I just think that BIG was coo but he is way overrated.
Pac forever L Fam

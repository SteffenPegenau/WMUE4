Big deal!
PLEASE!
Being immature and thinking you're cool by trying to start things with Lindsay, grows old fast!
Hillary my advise to you........ Stop trying to be something you're not, work on your voice because it's not the greatest thing like you think it is, and GROW UP!
If you want to hear rock listen to Limp Bizket, Linkin Park, or Nickleback!
The girl doesn't even know who she is!
She is far from rock, and so immature!
And if I were Hillary (which I'm thankful I'm not) I wouldn't blame Lindsay, I'd blame Aaron!
It takes two to cheat!
My sister has her cd and doesn't listen to it anymore, because Hillary sings bubble gum pop!
Good luck in the future, and finding your TRUE self!
She keeps instigating a fight between her and Lindsay Lohan!
Get over it!
She thinks she's singing rock!
So Aaron dated her!

This product needs an adjustment made to the spring or either the sandwiches grids made deeper.
The top of the grill is too heavy.
I did return this with no problem.
Of course that was 50 years ago and I forget the manufacturer.
I thought it was her that did something wrong.
So I tried it; same thing, cheese melted all over the grids and bread flatter than pancakes.
Dissaster.
The cheese melted all over the grids and the sandwiches were as flat as a pancake.
But you can forget the sandwiches.
She had a good waffle and sandwich maker.
I hope they can fix this problem.
B&D has some good products; but, I don't know what happened here.
I hope B&D can rectify the problem.
It works fine for the waffles and I like the waffle timer.
I would like to have a good old fashioned grilled cheese sandwich like my mother use to make.
I have several Black and Decker products, but this one really disappointed me.
My daughter used it first for grilled cheese sandwiches.
Thank You.

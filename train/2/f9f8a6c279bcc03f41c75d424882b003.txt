At best my final pieces are going to be second-rate with this product.
Maybe it has to do with the age, which is why I mentioned it above.
The impression is something weathered and cheap.
That might sound good but it's not!
Still, 6 months and it's no good?
Every time!
I've followed the instructions to the letter, and failing that, tried a few slight variations.
Don't bother with this stuff unless you plan to use dye.Second, bubbles everywhere!
Rather disappointed so far.
Even then, I was still getting stray bubbles.
I bought this stuff and then didn't do anything with it for about six months, so it sat in its box in a closet the whole time.Finally got around to using it.
Forget what the instructions say.
Plan for bubbles on EVERY pour.
Still get a few bubbles every time.
First off, the finished product is yellow, not clear like the box says.
How long are my finished pieces going to last?It looks like a white wine or champagne.
Make sure you have a heat gun or blow dryer handy.

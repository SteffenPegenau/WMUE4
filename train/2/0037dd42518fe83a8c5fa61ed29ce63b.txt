that would be the day.
Buy the cd just to support this insanly good band even if it is as bad as it is.
If your expecting another keasby nights you will be very surprised.
I gave it 2 stars because catch 22 put out the album and they are an amazing band.
wow ... this cd is disapointing.
If i could say it one more time BUY KEASBy NIGHTS INSTEAD.
Oh yea go see them live they are increadible.
I felt the only good song was number 7.
It serriously doesnt even come close to any of their previous recordings.
Maybe we will all forget this album was ever created and they will make another keasby nights.
I would buy it just to complete your catch 22 colection.
If you want to listen to a more pop/ska type record i guess this would be a good thing to buy.
they should be respected for there amazing previous albums.
If your just being introduced to catch 22 then i strongly recomend buying keasby nights instead.
i guess try to enjoy this album if you can.

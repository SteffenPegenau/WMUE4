Crisis...Resolution.
Over and over and over and over again and again.
Tedious.
I am 2/3 through this novel and I am debating whether to just put it down and walk away.
It never lasts.
I find that the critical reviews here are more in line with my own.
Over and over and over and over again and again.
The villains rape, kill, pillage, and burn.
I realize that the kiss of death (literally and figuratively) for the main characters is good fortune.
"Why 2 stars?
Did I already write that?The most accurate review that I have read here so far was titled..."400 Pages too long!
The first half was good.
Good fortune means bad things are on the way.
Then they get a slap in the wrist and do it again.
Crisis...Resolution.

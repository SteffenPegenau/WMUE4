I don't want to hate, 'cause anyone from the Lou is straight with me.
Maybe this CD needs to grow on me.
It's no rap voice.
Sorry.
But I really can't bear to take it out and listen to it again.
But who am I to say what's a "rap voice", right?
But I did, and it's gonna be forever stashed in my CD collection.
But it's annoying to me.
All the songs were about women, bling, and cars.
There is nothing to describe Chingy's CD.
But seriously, dog.
I got on track 2 and I realized that I couldn't make it through the rest of the album.
Yeah.
First off, his voice is annoying.
Chingy's gonna be a hot rapper, so I'm not disrespectin', but I'm not gonna be one of the people who think so.
But what else is new, right?
I don't know.
So, you judge that.
To be honest with you, it wasn't as hot as I thought it'd be.

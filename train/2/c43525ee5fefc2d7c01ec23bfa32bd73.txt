There are other reviews complaining of this same issue.
I opened it up, and there is indeed a battery in it, but it does not work.
A few months later, I decided to switch over.
I ordered a replacement battery from a seller here at Amazon, hope it is not the charging circuit.
I left it home after that and continued to use my C530.
I read a review that said this model does not come with a battery.
I hope this is a good fix, and the 255W does not suffer the same fate.
Good job, Garmin.
When power is lost, that is it, it would not continue on battery power.
Did you buy a bunch of junk batteries?
I read the warranty, and conveniently, the battery is not covered.
I decided it was time for a backup, and possibly an upgrade,..something easy to take along for a walk.
I tried this GPS for a few days in my truck, and everything was fine.
Yes, I already tried a different cord, from my 255W.
I have been using a Garmin C530 for years.

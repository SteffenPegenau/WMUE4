I think it was a dull book because it had no humor, excitment, or action.
He finds land.
David dumps his uncle's ashes in the ocean, but while doing this he hits a storm.
A few nights later, David woke up to a shark bumping the boat.
The wind picks up.
The action was very little and had no excitement at all.
The storm takes him to the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
David just woke up, drank four cups of water, looked at the ocean, or cleaned, and then went to bed.
Plus, I didn't like the part about David reading Owen's diary.
The Voyage of the Frog was about a boy named Divid trying to survive.
In between the begining and middle of the storm, David hits his head and gets a concussion.
The next week a tanker went by, but does not see him.
When he awoke from his sleep there's whale junk on him.
Then,atlast some whale watchers find him.
At the end David is going to travel home.This book was a very sluggish book.
I would not reccomend this book.

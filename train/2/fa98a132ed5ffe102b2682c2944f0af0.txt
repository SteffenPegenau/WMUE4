If you just need an mp3 player there is probably a better one somewhere.
The headphones hurt after a while but they have good quality.
If you don't care about the quality and don't mind the skips back and fourth you can buy this.
And sometimes when you are just listening it will jump to the beggining of the next song and go back to where it was playing.
I got this player to play mp3's because i go on long road trips.
It has some problems playing mp3's and it has some glitches like freezing sometimes when playing and the lens is loud.
I tried multiple times to search and it would freeze like a computer.
Battery life could be longer.
Te chrome around the volume looks very cheap.
It's just a little clip but you can notice it very clearly (it's annoying).
I don't recommend buying this.
I returned it.
I had to take out the batteries to make it stop.
I wasn't pleased with it's quality.
It works if you don't search through songs.

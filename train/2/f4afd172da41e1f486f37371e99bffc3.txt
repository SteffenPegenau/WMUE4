I'm sorry, but Shania can do much better.
But I have to say she's releasing a greatest hits album way too early in her career.
I listen to her all the time.
But all the old songs are solid gold.
"I'm Having a Party" is a horrible song.
Buy the albums they came off of.
She only has 3 albums.
That's even below Britney's standard.
I don't count her self titled as an album because it...well it sucked.
There are a few new songs.
I've seen her twice in concert.
I love Shania.
She's one of my favorite artists.
I think money would be better spent buying the 3 albums that are featured on this greatest hits album than actually buying it.
I can't believe Shania and Mutt wrote that trash.
All of which are terrible.

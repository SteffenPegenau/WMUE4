It only displays "DVD/CD" or FM/AM station.
When playing a cd or dvd, there's no display on the front to know what track you're on.
500 watts is an total misnomer.
when you turn it on or off there is a loud "crack/thump" as the amplifier turns itself on.
The speakers are what you'd expect $5 speakers to sound like.
The sound quality is very bad.
The rear wireless speaker has a constant buzz.
Everything from the cables to the speakers are the cheapest you can possibly get.What's good: ease of setup (everything is color coded).
Its more like 15W-20W or about what you'd expect out of a $30 boom box.
You get what you pay for.... more or less.
The video part of a movie is good.
Having 5 sources of sound in a room is nice.Overall, I'm torn.
look around.
I'm not sure if I should return it, or keep it and buy a few nicer speakers for the front 3 channels.BTW: If you are going to buy it, please, please don't pay more than $100 for this.
Its very light, and seems very cheap.

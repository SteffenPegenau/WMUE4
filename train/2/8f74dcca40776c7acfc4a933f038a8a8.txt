This song at least has lyrics though.
Lullaby For Scout In Ten Years is also more rhythmmic than melodic, and harmony isn't even considered.
It's sparse and monotonous.
It was like indie-folky singer-songwriter stuff.
I guess her mission for this album was to get in touch with her primal rock self of something.
The title track is barely even a song.
Most of the song is a simple bass melody, which the vocal melody follows along with note by note.
It's like a kinda electroclash dance track, very percussively oriented and there's only 2 lines of lyrics, repeated incessantly.
This new album totally sucks.
I liked her last album.
Then there are a couple of bursts of powerchord rock towards the end, which also follow the bass melody exactly.
It really sucks.
It was a bad idea.
The vocals remind me a bit of Cat Power.
The songs suck.

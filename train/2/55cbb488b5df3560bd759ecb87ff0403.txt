My wife wants to know if the alarm is set.
Where's the one labeled alarm, to set the alarm?
We'll find out in the morning.
Where's the one labeled time, to set the clock?
Set the alarm - press the alarm button and twist the dial.
Set the clock - press the clock button and twist the dial.
I can's say with any confidence that it is.

14 buttons and 2 knobs on the front.

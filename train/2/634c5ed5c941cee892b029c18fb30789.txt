The wording is confusing and I had somewhat of a hard time reading the story and fully understanding it.
The book was published in 1883.
It took me a while to finish the book because I just could not read it.
But, it does teach good life lessons such as,be careful who you trust,some people will do anything for money,and many more.
It could not keep my attention.
Some of these people use others just to get what they want.
I did not like the book at all.
I found the book quite boring.
Personally it has way too much violence for me.
There are several people on this ship, some that Jim can trust can some that he really shouldn't.
I had to read Treasure Island for class.
I would not suggest this book to young children or people who don't like violence and pirates.
This influences him to go on a ship to find Captain Flint's treasure.
All of the problems helped the main character learn these lessons.
The main character,Jim, suffers losses at an early age.

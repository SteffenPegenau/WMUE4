It just makes a clicking sound...
Then the dvd player stopped reading the dvds.
No problem with it eating the tapes as others have.
I don't want to stack another dvd player on top or to the side, and I hate to throw away a vcr that works fine...
When you put the disc in, it does nothing.
I am very annoyed, because now I have a vcr that works, with the dvd that doesn't.
The same thing would happen.
Both dvd and vcr played well for about 1 year.
The machine would be really hot.
I purchased this unit about 1.5 years ago.
You could turn it off, the machine would cool off and then try again.
For awhile you could watch the dvd and half way through the movie it would just freeze up.
NOW, nothing happens.
I cleaned the unit and it still didn't help.
The vcr works fine.

I think this could be a pretty good anime.
Then I realized I missed an important scene in the movie.
And I tried HARD!
They all talk in this flat, straight, serious voice.
My only real complaint is the voice acting.
I began thinking about a funny episode of "Family Guy."
But all the boys are a little too pretty if you ask me.
The plot is so dry but what makes it dry is the voice acting.
Somebody please get these characters personalities!
It's like they're all asleep and their mouths run on copilot.
At least if they were it would make the story a little more interesting.
I've heard rumors some of them are gay.
The animation is beautiful and the character design is well done.
I don't understand why this series is so popular.
But as this movie went on my mind got bored and went elsewhere.
Not that I understood a single thing in it in the first place.
I rented this movie to TRY and get into it.
Get some actors who have more than one tone in their voices and this movie might be pretty good.

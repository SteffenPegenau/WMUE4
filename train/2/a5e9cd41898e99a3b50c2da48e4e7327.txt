Ja-Ja Binks was the real winner, here, and I'm not getting into the racist dialogue.
He was a unique character, and his city under the sea was truly inspiring.
I can't imagine a planet that reminds me of New York City.
He had nothing to do with being a Jamaican, no matter what anyone says.
The city planet was a strange place, and it reminded of all the trips to Boston on Rte 128 or Rte 495.
The rest of the movie was a set-up for the next.
Then there were the Jedi's.
That was a truly disturbing vision.
Not too inspiring, either.
Already over 2,000 reviews on this thing so far.
Typical Lucas fare.
Boring, boring, and politically boring.
That's amazing, but even more amazing was how uninspiring this film was.
The villains were preposterous, as was the alleged UN of the planets.
Just the same kind of stuff as in the year 2002.

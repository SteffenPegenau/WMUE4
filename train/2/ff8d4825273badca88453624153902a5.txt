Most of his books are mostly chatter.
I don't think he is a good writer.
I think the whole thing could've been summarized in 50 pages maximum.
I think the book is very basic and elementary.
The rolling stocks mentioned in the book are not rolling any longer so we could not use it as reference.
I will not buy another book from Wade Cooke.
I shared the book in my study group, we all feel the same way about this book.
One whole chapter he talks about how his business is not a day trade and how his feeling were hurt that an interviewer called it that.
If I wanted advertising, I would get info channel.
I was particullarly interested in rolling stocks which was a small portion of the book.
Although, I didn't know much about stocks, reading this book did not help much.
The books are basically massive advertising for his seminars.
The book is very general.
I was very disappointed.
He repeats the unimportant material over and over and over.

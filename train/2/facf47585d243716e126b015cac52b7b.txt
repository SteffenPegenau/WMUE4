However, feeding the baby can be hard at times as the game doesn't read the stylus movements very well.
Apparently her parents didn't want her.
Wow, nice game!
Overall, you can wash dishes, feed the baby, rock the baby, dress them up, mow the lawn, vacumm the attic, change diapers, and order things "online".
We left the game on for 8 hours straight!
I wish I could play the game, but I guess it is broken.
Also, the things we ordered "online" stopped coming.
Buy at your own risk.
My little sister got this for Christmas last year and I'll admit it is pretty fun.
The babies are adorable.
Plus, she was the fussiest baby, Ella.
I don't even mess with playing the instruments; they're so hard to work.
I should warn you though.
We have one child that will NOT go home.
People really go for the games that don't change for 8 hours!

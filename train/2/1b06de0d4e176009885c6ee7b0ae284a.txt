This isn't a memoir so much as a selfish rant.
I saw the author on Hardball and was taken in.
For someone who is impressive onscreen, it's clear now he just speaks in sound bites (or he can't write).
The characters aren't real people.
They ebb and flow around his big head.
The writing is shoddy, the 'combat' he describes is more complaining than fighting, and he's so full of himself that his hint-dropping is tiresome.
I should have read the Publisher's Weekly review more closely.
Buyer beware.
I'm an avid reader.
The story has no pace and no intent except to say: Look at me.
I bought the book; what a mistake.
They are props for the author.
I was hoping for a much better read.
This is a churn-em-and-burn 'em platform.
Seemed like a good guy.

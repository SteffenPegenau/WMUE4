Oh, it hurts to have to write this.
Only Carl P comes out of it with credibility intact (I have seen him live recently, and can testify to his continuing dynamism).
Touch and Go 5.
Tiger in a Spotlight 3.
Fanfare etc./Blue Rondo 11.
As an original ELP fan, I really wanted to like this album.
It says it was recorded live on the 1997 'World Tour'.
Overall, this recording adds nothing good to the originals, neither does the 'live' dimension.
Honky Tonk Train Blues 8.
Tracks are: 1. karn evil 9 (actually 1st impression Pt 2) 2.
Take a Pebble 9.
Bitches Crystal 7.
Hoedown 4.
21st Century Schizoid Man/AmericaSadly, Keith E and Greg L announce their failing powers all too clearly.
Lucky Man 10.
Knife Edge 6.
The sound quality is OK, but nothing special.
Greg Lake employs the usual tricks - like avoiding sustained high notes - or sustained low notes, come to that - and sounds..well, fat, and Keith E substitutes speed in his 'improvisations' for creativity and accuracy.

Part 1 included subs in French, Spanish, and English for hearing impaired.
A subtitle track is a simple text file with timing script.
Less than 1 MB of space.
WHY???
I'm not totally deaf, but most of the characters in this series talk very fast, and their enunciation is not that great.
The show had closed captions available on the broadcast TV but NOT on the DVD collectors edition???
Seasons 1-4 all have English subs.
I will be re-selling this set, and waiting for a re-issue with proper features.Please write to ABC Family Channel, Paul Lee, President, 3800 West Alameda Ave., Burbank, CA 91505 and let them know your concerns, Thank you!
In part 2 they dropped this essential feature.
But not on Season 5.
There are NO English subtitles for the hearing impaired.
This is a fantastic series, I was anxiously awating part 2 of season 1.
I am so sick of this!!!
But WHAT HAPPENED???
(La Femme Nikita did the same thing.
Show a little concern for the hearing impaired.)

Greatest sci-fi epic ever.
Bear spends a lot of time creating a family for Patricia, then drops it like a, well, potato :) He didn't have the imagination to bring them back in at the end like any good author would have, and have events lead to psychological self-discoveries.
Well-written.
Sorry, but after slaving through this 150,000 word tome, I felt cheated.
Complexity and emotion in the characters.
Not!
Wrote a sequel?
The sole positive is his apparent superficial study of relativity theory and topology, and his plot device of the Stone itself.
You can get that much in a TV movie of the week!
But even that seems to degenerate from almost pseudo science to pure magic and fantasy muck by the "geometrically increasing" end.
I could have had a V-8 :) The characters are shallow, wooden stick figures.
Yiyiyi!
Not!
And he did what?

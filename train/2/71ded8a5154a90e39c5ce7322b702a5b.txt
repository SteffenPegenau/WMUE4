It leads to an arduous read because other than the amusing epigrams from the military text that starts each chapters, this novel is so paper-thin.
The hero, the heroine, the two aunts and the basic plot are all cardboard cutouts.
No historical atmosphere, of course (not that I was expecting any).
And the author barely makes that 300 pages mark despite what Amazon sez.
.
Only that one good germ of an idea and it's not enough.
You know when someone has a good joke and doesn't expand upon it and just tries to stretch this same joke as long as they can til it stopped being funny, oh about twenty minuted ago?
.
Well, that's Rules of Engagement by Kathryn Caskie in a nutshell.
.
In this specific instance, playing on the saying "All's fair in love and war."
and stretches it some more until she gets to the requisite 300 pages.
wait for it .
Caskie takes the cute idea of using a military text as a how-to manual for getting engaged and stretches it, stretches it .

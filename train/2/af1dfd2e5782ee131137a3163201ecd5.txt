I vacuume everyday.
I know it is alot of money but if you need something that will make your carpet CLEAN.
I spend 35.00 a month replacing the hepa filter.
I have a 2&4 year old and Great Danes.
My mo just bought the Animal made by Dyson.
Spend more money and be happy.
Other than that is SUCKS in a bad way.
This is the one.
!
Oh yeah I have only had this Hoover for a year!!!!!!!!!!!
I am saving to go buy it.
Holly Cow this is the best thing I have ever see.
It smells like rubber everytime.
This vacuume does a Great job if you empty the canister and replace the hepa filter everyday.
I know I expect alot out of a Vacuume but trust me this is not the one.

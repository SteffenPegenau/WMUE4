I'm a long time pumpkins fan since, since long before... well.. just for a long time.
But .. "honestly" - this album is a joke.
Billy's probably laughing his way to the bank.
Look, billy doesnt have the sweetest voice.
I first heard this album at a bar in the Village.
And there are some great back vocals too that make for an almost "gish" feel.
Save your money and borrow a friends copy before deciding.
This CD has got to be a joke.
The music is tight, and brilliant in some songs and some fashions.
This album is a joke!
It is so awful.
(i wasnt that drunk).
So when he just repeats himself over and over and over again he really gets on your nerves.
I dug it, from what i could hear.
The lyrics just repeat themselves OVER AND OVER AND OVER again on every song.
Im down with happy music and his supposed "emotional transition" - but this seems fake.
But now that i have it im wondering what i hear that night!

One of which was a store replacement for the other.
Get anything else.
Which makes you wonder if I just got a dud.
Now I have 2 Plextor Dual Layer DVD burners in both of those systems and they have worked flawlessly ever sense.I would suggest you stay away from Sony drives.
Doesn't have to be what I have.
Seems like a pretty lousy gamble buying Sony DVD burners to me.
Both of those died in 2 completely different computers over the span of 3 months each.
(Most likely) But then I start thinking about it and I have had 2 previous single layer models.
But 3 sony drives on 2 different computers, all dead.
Something to think about.)
My drive like this stopped working in about 15 days.
I'm 3 for 3 on Sony and 0 for 2 using other brands.
This new one was in a spanking new system I just built with it.
I think anything else should do.
(but I understand Sony drives are often just remarked LightOn's.

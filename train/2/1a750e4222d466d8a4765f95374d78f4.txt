THAT'S HORRIBLE!
Though these few episodes are enjoyable(that's why I gave this a 2/5 instead of a 1/5), the series itself is terrible for children.
That's not right for a children's show!3.
Static said suck.
*rolls eyess)I can go on forever, but it seems you get my point.
I can think of many black heroes(Luke Cage, Bishop, Black Spider, Amazing Man 1, Amazing Man 2, Black Racer, Joshua Clay, Cyborg, Steel 1, Steel 2, must I go on?).2.
A SUPERHERO FIGHT IS ONE THING, BUT TALKING?!?!
RICHIE PUNCHED VIRGIL OVER A FIGHT!
A KID SHOT RICHIE IN THE KNEE CAP!
THAT'S HORRIBLE!
This show is terrible.
Static Shock complains that there are not enough black superheroes.
I usually don't care, but that's something not for today's young.4.
Let's list the non children features shown in the show in total, shall we?1.
RACIST TV FOR KIDS?!?!?!
WHAT A KID SHOW!

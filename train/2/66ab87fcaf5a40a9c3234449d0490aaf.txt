It is very cheaply built.
He gave me a number to call and said everything would be made right.
Wider strap, stronger clips.
I also own six Stabila levels of various sizes and love them.
This time I ran into a Stabila rep at my local hardware store.
Luckily it fell and dinged me in the leg or I would have suffered the same fate as the other writers.
This tripod was attractive to me at first because of the price and features.
The plastic clips on the carry strap broke day two.
They cost a lot and help me make money.
Again, went to the hardware store and fixed it myself.
Have Stabila call me, I'll give them a parts list so they can start building it right.
I am a contractor, but take very good care of my tools.
Why wouldn't I, right.
So, I bought one and used it.
Ha, I knew better, five calls over three months and no return call.
The following week one of the chains pulled out of the legs.
I went to a hardware store and bought some make a strap parts.

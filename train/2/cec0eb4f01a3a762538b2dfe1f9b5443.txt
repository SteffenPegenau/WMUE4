Why is she such a jerk?
I know that alot of people will disagree with me and that's fine.
There is not one likeable character on the show!
That's also true of the Twilight movies, too.
I have read all of Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse novels and they are fantastic.
I will be honest and say that I did not make it through the entire first season.
Sorry if you don't agree.
If you love vampires, do yourself a favor and read the books and forget about this show.
And what is up with Tara?
Secondly, the writing is so bad!
They don't do the books justice by any means.
OMG!
I just don't think it's any good.
My first complaint is that Sookie and the vampires (Bill and Eric) aren't good looking enough.
Now people say that I will compare it to the books and that's not true.
I just couldn't take any more.

I like tabs.
If that's you, fine.
At a minimum, the author should have presented both notation and tabs and let the reader decide.
Yeah, I hate the Dummies name too.
It's not me.
The lack of tabs (diagram of the notes on the bass) in most sections and examples totally ruins what could have been an outstanding book.
Don't let that influence you.
There is some value in the book.
Some may feel philosophically that one must learn how to read music.
The author prefers to illustrate many examples and pieces in JUST traditional musical notation.
More power to you.
That's why I borrowed it from the library rather than buy it.If you desire a beginners book that does give you the option of musical notation OR tabs in many instances check out "Bass Guitar for Dummies."
Potentially it was.
It is very well done, comprehensive, easy to understand and comes with a CD which facilitates both learning and developing a good ear.As always...YMMV........
Great book?

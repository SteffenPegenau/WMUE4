No sex worthy of mention and no nudity.
So she's a ditz and a tramp, and the old guy is a pig and a perv.
I watched it a few days ago and have no lingering memory at all.
Not True!
Boring.
No suspense at ALL, just mindless conversation by self-centered idiots.
A young woman (very sexy) falls for a married author.
The three main characters in this movie are all vacuous fools.
And she sees and uses this young guy, played extremely ineffectively, when things fall through with the old fart.
Dull.
All in all, just a waste.
Okay, to enjoy a film, I personally need a character to at least feel some empathy with.
A spoiled useless rich punk prone to jealousy and fits of stupidity.
And it's advertised as being sexy and adult.
Maybe a few, and I want them to go away soon.

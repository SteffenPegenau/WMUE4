A cameo by Sarandon as the mother.
The twists keep you turning the pages.
For consistent chemistry, lets toss in Ms. Dunst as the love interest.
And that is the problem.
Where are the characters, the people, good and bad, with whom Mr. Abott has taken our imaginations in his past efforts?
Where is the thought and the heart that has made my Judge Whit Mosely my favorite jurist?
Some flashbacks.
Jeff Abbott knows better.
And writes better.
Gone to Hollywood it appears.
That is not necessarily a bad thing.
This book works as a script.
Abbott is consistent.
Redford as the father.
It is a let down for this reader.
Toby Maguire as the protagonist.
You can see the movie.
The plotting is tight.
Once again, he has a character "tent his cheek".
It continues Abbot's obsession with missing mothers and mysterious fathers all bound together by the love of a son.

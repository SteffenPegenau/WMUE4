Most of the reviews of this Black Label Society DVD are an enthusiastic "two thumbs up."
I've always admired his skill on guitar.
Heck, he's not even a GED.
This DVD's not so bad.
I guess every band has loyal fans that will praise just about anything the band does.
Did this guy graduate high school?
I've got all the BLS stuff, so I'm definitely a fan.
How can you not???
But the guy can't sing.
I was so pumped up to buy this thing when it came out, but man was I disappointed.On the positive side, there's some cool extra stuff on the disc, including a guitar lesson in which Zakk breaks down a couple classic solos note-by-note.
This DVD is proof of that.
Pretty cool if you're a guitarist.However, one of the DVD's extras, the interview with Zakk, shows what a drunken dope the guitarist really is.
It's good for a laugh, though.
Mr. BLS is no PhD.
I've got 2 fingers up for Zakk, but they ain't thumbs.Just kidding.

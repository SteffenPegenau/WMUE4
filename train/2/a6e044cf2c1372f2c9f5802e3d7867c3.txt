You have to read the book to find out what happens.
I like the fact that it took place in feudal Japan.
Muna meets a guy named Takanobu.
Fukuji takes care of him for a year.
The book also leave a lot of loose ends.
I didn't like this book very much.
Takanobu takes care of Muna on thier way to the capital.
The rest of the book could definatly be better.
I said too much.
His mom also told him that his dad has a tatoo of a chrysanthemum on his shoulder.
Like what happened to certain characters and if they are sure what some people said is true.
Then he meets a swordmaker named Fukuji.
The book was about a boy named Muna.
At first Muna doesn't like his name because it means "no name".
Then there is a fire and Takanobu dies.
His mother recently passed away and he is look for his dad, a big tall samurai.
But then .........oh no!!

We have a Roomba vac for the living room and it is a dream.
Not "cleaner than a mop."
When I bought this I had gotten sick of using a mop and bucket and really needed something faster.
I might have stuck with it if I could have replaced the solution with a water/Mop & Glo mix, but they have the bottle fixed so you can't.
Solution left a streaky, dull floor.
If you want something fast, stick with "Swiffer Wet."
Bottle is impossible to refill.
It doesn't cut it for a few reasons:1.
A mop at least can be rinsed.5.
Bottle only lasted 3 times for a very small kitchen.3.
No batteries, no solution to refill.
Mop & Glo with water works MUCH better.2.
Need to put batteries in the device (something I didn't realize when I bought it).4.
*sigh* I'm actually considering spending the $$$ for a "Scooba."
If you have a heavy-traffic floor like I do, you'd have to use about 3 clean pads on the floor to keep from pushing dirt around.

maybe his novels are only good for making into movies, but definitely not good for reading.
wasted a whole day trying to read along with this terribly written novel.
drake?
i should have given up this reading the day before yesterday, then i didn't have to pick it up and open it.
funds?
so many leads, so many unnecessary issues, chapters, bad dialogues, murders....blahblahblah...what's going on and what's the purpose of writing this piece of junk?
paris, london, vancour, epa, lawsuits?
why i have to waste time to read along?I knew crichton is not a good writer, but i've never known that he's so bad.
morton?
gulfstream?
environmental issues?
beverly hills?
crichton could not even make that peter evans look like, sound like, read like a real lawyer but a go-getter stupid moron.
every chapter is a date, time and a place, but to what purpose?
latte?
sigh......

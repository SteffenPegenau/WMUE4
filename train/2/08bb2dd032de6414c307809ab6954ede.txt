"Morgan Freeman's performance in this movie was also a big disappointment.
He's such a talented actor, but here he seems to be just going through the motions.
It started out fairly well but just didn't hold together after the initial introduction.
This movie could have been so much better.
And as noted in an earlier review, the hair and eyebrows make him look silly and cartoonish.No big surprises in the final battle sequence.
You've got a monster trapped in the toilet, but that toothpick on the floor is out of your reach, and you need it so badly that you let the monster out to get it?
You pretty much know by this point who the two sides are going to be.
That CAN'T be the end!"
What a let-down.
The movie lost me completely in the bathroom scene.
But that last little bit after the fight - whose idea was that?
His character just falls flat.
I just wanted to shout at the television, "What?
You have to ask yourself, "What's WRONG with this person?
NO!

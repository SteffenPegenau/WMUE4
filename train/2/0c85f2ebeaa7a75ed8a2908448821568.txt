Uh no.
Did I get drunk with my girlfriend's?
Yes.
Is her book an accurate account of excess in the youth community?
This girl had a safety net at every point and chose to continue being destructive and ridiculous despite loving parents, plenty of money and the opportunity to have a college education.
Can someone please stop this trend of rich-white-sorority-girl-bares-her-soul stories?
I have a lot of resentment towards her and women like her.
Does our youth culture drink too much?
Am I supposed to feel sorry for this girl?
But when she veers off into her oh-so-pained soul I want to speyack all over the cute cover.
Honey, when I was 18, I was working two jobs and worrying about my working-class mother's deteriorating health and lack of health insurance.
Yes.
Please.
Hell yes.
Did I write a book about it boo-hooing to the world that I'm not "really" that girl.

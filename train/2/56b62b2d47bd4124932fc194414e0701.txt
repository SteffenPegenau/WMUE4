This album is a HUGE let down to me.
Why did ARISTA allow you to come out with this album?
I am the biggest WH fan in the enire world.
There are no more ballads that have meaning in her work.
Please come back with the DIVA worthy material.
Even the ballads are mediocre.
Her voice is amazing.
Her tone has deepened dramatically.
ALl eyes are on you at this time but yet you come back with material that fit a teenager like ASHANTI or MONICA.
Yes, I know she has some issues right now, but it seems as though she is trying to go more urban and steer away from the adult contemporary music.
However, her latest work Just Whitney is not very good.
The overall album seems unfinished.
However, that is what she is known for.
What is happening to you Whitney?
These songs don't seem to match Whitney's vocal abilities.

She could use your help.
This casting thing is unique and cool but it isn't paying the rent for her.
She is a very likable person in the DVD.
Maybe she should help Ms. Caster get her book done.
Where is her life going?
Very sad.
Miss Des Barres is a good writer and Ms. Caster could benefit from a bit of work ethic.
I am a huge fan of Miss Pamela Des Barres.
She still gets $100.00 dollars a month from her mother who she calls the warden.
I would buy it and read it.
It is really nice when she gets her "show" in New York City but the buck stops there.
Miss Pamela??
It got frustrating.
Someone with so much talent needs to get some self respect and self worth.
I liked this DVD but I was not impressed.
Almost sweet.
When you can draw like Miss Caster you should persue some sort of craft.

yellow, yellow."
.
Teaches a basic concept - colors, in a format that won't overstimulate.Each color is introduced, one at at time, and the only words spoken are those colors.
yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow .

It eventually robs you of your will to live.This is a great movie to borrow from the public library, or your friend.
Just don't buy it, because you can't watch it more than a handful of times.

For example, the fuzzy yellow thing comes on and you hear "yellow, yellow .
Repeat with blue, black, white, green, etc.
yellow, yellow, yellow .
.
I really like the idea of this DVD.

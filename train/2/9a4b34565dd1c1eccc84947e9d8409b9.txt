use it alot.
very figitty.
the reseason i'm giving it two star is that does work sometime.
i had this for under two year.
it's working ok right now.
however, i'm going to keep the battery.
maybe both i don't realy know.
i had two battery and one nikon battery.
everything works quite well without the grip.
i realized that the camera doesn't reconized the battery or unit.
sometime it worked realy well other time it doesn't even recognize the nikon battery.
if i don't turn it tight then it be won't be very steady on the tripod.
i got this instead of getting the nikon mb80 because of the price and the extra battery.
about six month later.
well i love it.
i'm now willing to spend more for mb80.
anyway, most of my shotting are done without a tripod.
one other thing is that when i put the opteka on a tripod if i turn the quick release to tight the battery pop out inside the holder.

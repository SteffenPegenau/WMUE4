Its not the best or greatest comedy I've seen but its stupid enough to make you laugh like a bit.
That will funny.
THIS GIRL FROM OUT OF NO WERE DOESNT EVEN NO THIS GUY AND SHE WANTS TO BE WITH HIM!
It wasnt.
Eurotrip was suppose to be funny as hell.
Why cant they make a different ending wich lets you think and say "thats not how I pictured it".
Well for meit wasn't.
Unless all german girls are really like that than never mind about it.
The characters were lame and stupid.
I hate it that all teenager flicks alway have to make an ending when the main character gets the girl.
The plot was stupid and cheezy.
I shouldn't have but you make the dessision.I recommend you watch Club Dred.
The movie wasn't as good as rode trip I can tell you that.
Well if you wanna pay nine bucks for this crap be my guess.
The stories ending didn't make me really enjoy the movie.

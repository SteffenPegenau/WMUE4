It is an easy reader watch and ideal for people who have difficulty reading.
On the other hand, this watch is quite fragile and has to be protected from getting wet.
You cannot put back the back cover easily.
It is beautiful, reliable and keeps accurate time.
I won't buy another Timex watch.
I had to go to a jeweler just to get the battery changed and put the back cover tightly.
I am disappointed.
The dates do not change.
However, the price is quite steep.
The band is expandable and looks nice.Update2010 This watch barely lasted two years.
It just does not close.
However, setting the day is a hassle.
Setting the date is easy.
The watch looks great.
You have to keep rotating the hands until you get the correct day and time.

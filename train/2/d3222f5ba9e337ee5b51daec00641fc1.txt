Ok. Let me start by saying I LOVE Melissa and Doug products!
We also have the wooden animal stacking blocks.
The kids thought it was fun to carry it around.
Again, it will not keep me from purchasing this brand but unless it is made of wood I will stay away from it totally!
They do not stack even.
They are GREAT!
They were damaged.
So I am not sure what happened with these?
Matter of fact I have two things in transit currently to be delivered.These blocks are worthless!
We have spent literally thousands of dollars on them!
The ONLY redeeming quality was the box it came in.
I received them late.
They usually make GREAT stuff!
We love them!
Its crazy!
I have never had a bad thing to say!I will still purchase this brand.
These are a total waste of $!!!

Portuguese filmmaker Manoel de Oliveira was 89 years old with a resume that would let him make any damn film he wanted.
Family relationships gone bad.
So I respect it but I don't recommend it.
So what did he do?
Does that make any sense?
Beginnings and endings.
In that, it is brilliant.
Unflinching realism.
Even so, with an awareness that these films are a bit expensive in the US, I can't really recommend it.So what is it about?
Introspective and subdued in both style and scenery.It can be difficult to read subtitles in a dialogue-heavy film.
Atonement.
He went autobiographical.
What we remember, what we forget.
A fine cast of four, headlined by Marcello Mastroianni, drive from France to Portugal in search of one man's past.
But hell, it might bore somebody, I don't know.
But once we reach Portugal, most lines are between a French speaker and a Portuguese speaker, with a translator, and the luxury (for me) of seeing the same thing in English subtitles twice.

The soles shrink in high heat.
The soles of my Birkenstocks shrank approximately 1/4" from the edge of the leather on the sides and about 5/8" in the toe and heel.
I had my Birkenstocks in the back seat of my car.
The sole also partially separated from the upper.
None of my other possessions were affected on the same trip.
Grrr, Birkenstocks.
I'm not supposed to take Birkenstocks on vacation?
Or only wear them the whole time?
What happens if I want to go on a hike when I'm on vacation?
I guess I have to pack my Birks on my back.
Can't leave 'em in the car.
Like, what?
Yeah, I guess for the future I won't leave my shoes in the car when I go inside, but 'cmon, a pair of shoes should be able to handle a hot car on a normal day.
I parked in the sun on a hot day.
Generally, I like Birkenstocks, but they have one SERIOUS drawback.

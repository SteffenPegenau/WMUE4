Again sounding like a bitter memoir of a child.
This is is supposed to be a great book!Yet why...?
Arundhati Roy's much talked abput book is more of a personal narration of her life.
Otherwise it is one continuous drag.
After a point u simply do not want to bother.
The story is about twins, Rahel and Estha and their divorced mother.
So many phrases which the author thinks are cute, made me tear my hair in exasperation!
That was my reaction to the whole thing when I completed it.
A lot of venom is poured on the absent and dead father.
Some passages at the begining of each chapter are well written.
But the story is not linear at all, making it so difficult for a reader to hang on.
The first page is quite similar to that of Alan Paton's Cry the beloved country.
Yet...In the end ther is some confusion.
If you sympathise with her travails, you may like it.
So my feelings to sum up--- a pretty average fare....
Oh God!
What did finally happen to Sophie Mol?

Yes bring a kid to see this movie.
Two Stars....
Costume is the same as in the 80's version.
Without his power, he couldn't even fight half of Lex Luther.
At least put a Carbon fiber 'S' on his chest.
So Superman is in rehab for 5 years, finally he comes back, girlfriend Lois, left him, is now a single mother with a live in boyfriend.
Instead of brite red.
Anyway, we don't need to see too much of the softer side of this Superman.
The people who made Casino Royale should have come in to write and direct this movie and make Superman much tougher and meaner.
perhaps they should cast Daniel Craig as Superman.Lame movie.
Lex is twice his age.
Turns out while he's gone, Lex breaks into his crib and steals his Prized CD collections, puts one on ebay for alot of money.
How about a dark burgandy, dark blue suite that looks like the current version of Batman.
This has got to be the most Metrosexual of all comic book adaption of Superhero.
This action movie borderlines cheesy.

I fail to see the wisdom in this.
I am disappointed with the unit.
It is really loud with the doors open.
This is with the unit off and hard drive spun down!
But these are GLARING PROBLEMS.
The most notable is that the fan on the unit runs all the time.
I wasted fifty bucks on a USB wireless adapter to connect the machine wirelessly to my home network.
There is a USB jack that is dead.
There is no USB port on the machine.
Their excuse is that it is basically a future port.
Finally, it is slower than my old Panasonic Showstopper 2000 at loading channels.
This is a lie.
Do your research
We have it in our bedroom and even inside an amoire with the doors closed I can hear it.
And it is not quiet.
Be advised.
Second, there is a USB 1.1 port specified on the specs on the web site.
It has several glaring problems.
Otherwise I am pleased with the features.

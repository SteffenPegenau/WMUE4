My old one I used to have to hold up a can that big.UPDATE: January 30, 2010...OK, one year later.
It opens everything so easily.
I don't know about it being so tall, it looks average size.
It does peel the paper a little off the can, but not to where it makes a mess.
It is worth it.
So annoying.
It never made it.
I love this can opener.
Getting so tired of appliances never lasting.
The paper still stays intact on the can.
I'm changing my star rating from 5 to 2.
It also took a large can of tomatoes (28 oz) and opened it, no problem.
I love this can opener.
I finally decided to stop spending only $10 on a no name cheap can opener from a retail store.
It stopped working a few months ago.
I spent a little more here, not much a couple of dollars.

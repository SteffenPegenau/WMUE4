However, I should have returned this product after finding that the unit I have does not toast evenly.
It has a bagel setting.4.
As the title says, it's a toaster.
It toasts.
But so does a $20 model.I thought I was purchasing the best toaster in the world- one that would make the best toast ever.
Viewing through the toast holes one can see that the heating coils inside the unit do not become evenly bright- thus not toasting evenly.
If yours doesn't toast well, return as soon as possible for refund or replacement.
It looks nice.2.
I suppose I expected more from the KitchenAid brand.
Be skeptical.
But does it toast?
Yep.
Two stars because of the price and also because, as other unsatisfied reviewers describe, quality of the unit varies greatly.
I have had mine for over a year.1.
Easy to remove crumb tray.3.
Easy to cancel toasting.5.

No power.
Now, place it into a bowl and pour milk over it.
The author doesn't believe in tapping into this power.
It may be a decent beginner book, but there are better ones out there.
The stories are about demonized people, but there is a lack of deliverance.
It has all the theological words correct, it's not heresy, but it lacks the power of the Spirit.
Take some bread, toast it crunchy, get ready to taste great breakfast.
He never tells people with demonic strongholds to read anything else but his previous book.
Not the Bible, only his book.
If you want teaching with power and experience, get Derek Prince or Bob Larson material.I lost count how many times the author mentions the greatness of his previous book.
Milk-Toast.
I get the impression this author wanted to jump on the deliverance band-wagon, but lacks real life experience to make this book worth anything.
This is what the book is like.
It lacks power.
I gave it two stars only because he was not a heretic.

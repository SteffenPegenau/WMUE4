The religious cult idea didn't fly either.
I didn't hate it ONLY because I am a gore fan and there was a little of it (NOT MUCH) and Jillian Swanson has nice looking tits.
First of all I didn't buy this from Amazon or one of its sellers.
That was my first mistake.
Sometimes movies based on true stories just don't work.
Don't waste your time with this one.
This story should have been changed where the woman was insane and killed several boy friends instead of just one.
I really liked The Boogeyman but he messed this one up big time.
Over and over and over the same scene with her holding a knife.
It is SO druged out.
I could have read the customers reviews.
Hey at least there were a couple of interesting previews from Lions Gate before the movie.
The screenplay was horrable.
MY last mistake was NEVER trust a DVD by it's cover.
(So much for my two stars) My second mistake was trusting Ulli Lommel.

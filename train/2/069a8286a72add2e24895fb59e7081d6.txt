Don't waste your time or money.
Jane's started their downward spiral when they released Ritual.
I "discovered" Jane's Addiction before anyone else I knew, before Nothing's Shocking was even released.
In a word, this album sucks.
My buddies and I would listen to songs like "My Time," or in their next album "Summertime Rolls" over some good conversation and drinks.
It's just flat, boring, and worthy of nothing other than the "used" bin at your local record store.
We'd talk about the lyrics and try to duplicate the guitar riffs until we were too drunk or our fretboard fingers hurt too much to go on.
No way.
They just aren't anymore.
Gone are those days.
They weren't completely done then, but there were inklings.
They used to be cool.
Fond are my memories of days gone by.
Perry had gone off the deep end, and after several more years of too many drugs, so have the rest of them.
It has no life to it.
Not even close.

These were the first discs i got, when i got into MD in 1999.
Anything else there is a sure bet to be better than these memorexes.
MD's are claimed to be eraseable over a thousand times!
You're better of with some higher quality discs imported from japan.
Well, i guess memorex's arent.
Ive probably had an error on every other disc i tried to record on.
You wont know you've had an error till they player tries to edit the TOC, at the end of your recording session.
These discs are really a pain to record on.
Try minidisco.com, just stay away from the hi-space they have there.
Unfortunately, when i got other discs from sony, and TDK, i realized how bad they were.
Where these discs really fail is quality.
The sound is as good as on any other disc, but the errors are very annoying.
Sure, they look cool, but all MD's look cool.
Then you lose everything.

And this happened after only the 3rd or 4th write.

It never came back to life.
It is not water proof.
This item made them a bunch of money due to these misrepresentations.
It has limited ability to manuever.
I am looking into what a consumer can do to make the company compesate those they defrauded.
It does not move in sand well or at all.
The manufacturers should not be allowed to make the claims they have regarding the toy.
What does?
My unit stopped working 3 minutes after being on water.
It does not live up to the hype.
The control buttons are not durable.
Some of the simplest turns are hard to make with this system.
The grey underbody is not sealed and neither are the pontoon augers that propel the machine.
The Terrain Twister should not be put in water.
The controller is very cheaply made.

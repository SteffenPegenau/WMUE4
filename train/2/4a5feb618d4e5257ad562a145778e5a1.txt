She's an assistant professor of literature, yet she behaves so juvenilely about her clothing and the inconveniences of the past?
I hope the rest are better.
However, the whole premise has faults - Camelot?
It's all so fabled already that it would take greater talent than Ms. Alexander's to add to its mythology.I particularly couldn't believe the main character, Tessa.
Okay, I was thinking I couldn't lose with this one.
Time travel - good.
I liked Galahad for the most part; although, what's the poor guy supposed to do with that name in the 20th century?I have yet to read more Alexander books.
Ha!
Please - grow up.
Hunting for the Holy Grail?
Galahad?
Romance - good.
It has its moments - the character of Merlin is particularly memorable.
This particular mix is not good.
For truly excellent time-travel romance, check out Lynn Kurland.
Medieval times - good.

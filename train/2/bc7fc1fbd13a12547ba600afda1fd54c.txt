Fever was the ultimate film of the 1970s.
What was Travolta to do?
What this is simply a complete waste of talent.
Honest, they were.
The score, some songs by the Bee Gees, is even disappointing.
You betcha!
Travolta went through a great workout and had a sculpted body.
Maybe it should be retitled, "Saturday Night Sickness."
Someone got the great idea of letting Sylvester Stallone write and direct this project.
Sooo lame.
What came out of this mess was a hit single "Far From Over," which strangely enough came from a struggling singer named Frank Stallone.
Oiy!
People were clammering for a sequel to "Saturday Night Fever."
The sloppy story is predictable, and the finale production number makes "Showgirls" finale an outstandiong piece of theater.
This could have been more.
Any relation?
I guess it was Rambo: the Musical.

He returns catatonic.
The alternate Universe is pure chaotic evil?
No explanation other than *it* went to the other side and returned that way.
The ship is evilly alive(???).
I was disappointed in this movie.
Most of the crew dies, and I don't really care about anyone anyway.
A guy goes through a black hole, we guess.
We never find out.
I end up rooting for the evil guy just because I like the actor.
What happened to the old crew?
Pure chaotic evil couldn't last.
It makes no sense.
It could have been so much more.
So, what did he experience?
Only scattered fragments of illogically inane horror tell that story.

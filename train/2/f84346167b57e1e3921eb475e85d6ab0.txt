I'm willing to get just about any book a chance.
Otherwise, it's just a lot of confusing dialogue and strange chapters that seem to go nowhere and are hard to follow.
I had to give up on this book because it was just way too much effort.
The concept of the scramble suit and everything is really fascinating.
There are sentences of dialogue and such that barely even make sense after I read them 5 times over.
I have no idea what the book is driving at.
I wasn't really enjoying it on any level.
This book is just too weird and disjointed.
I have no idea what's really going on.
I may try reading it again, but I doubt it.
and enjoyed it.
I would only recommend this book if you're an absolute hardcore Philip K Dick fan.
I hardly ever give up on books, so I'm actually pretty upset that I had to give up on this one.
I've read "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"
I wish I coulda given this more stars, but I have to be honest.

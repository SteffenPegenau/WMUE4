If you work it this hard, it simply stops work.
I use brush, spoon, folks, chopsticks, and everything in between to take the coffee out.
The reasons being: 1].
But there is ALWAYS something left behind.
The machine cannot take grinning time continuously anything longer than 20 minutes.
Coffee still comes out that way.
No matter how hard you shake during the grinding process, it doesn't help.
I found myself use it less and less.
3].
You have to wait for 10 minutes to have it work again.Rethink about buying this grinder!
It doesn't grind beans in a consistent fashion.
4].
I've owned this grinder for more than 2 years.
You cannot grind many at a time.
2].
As previous posters said, it is very difficult and messy to 'pour' out the coffee (if you can call it pour).
Putting too many beans in the grinder will only worsen the outcome.
The top beans are coarsely grinded and the bottom beans are Turkey-Coffee-Fine grinded.

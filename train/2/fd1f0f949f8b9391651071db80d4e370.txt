Borrow it from your local library, if you feel the need to read it at all.
There are so many time-frame discrepancies in this book.
These concepts were so distracting to this reader.
It's 1907 for Heaven's sake - no guidance counselors back then!
!
It would have been bookkeeping back then.
Most people didn't even earn a high school diploma!
And she speaks of people taking accounting classes.
Mom is a much more recent name.
Such a disappointment!!
Author also speaks of bio-chemistry.
Surely she would have been either Mother or Ma.
Belva Plain's writing has deteriorated with every book since her first terrific "Evergreen".
She refers to a guidance counselor in the high school.
The sons in this book referred to their father as "Pa", but called their mother "Mom".
In 1912, it would have been just plain chemistry.
Don't bother to buy this book.

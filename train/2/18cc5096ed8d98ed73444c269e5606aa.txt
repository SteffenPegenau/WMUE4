In every picture or tale of this man, he has that big a** mustache.
Pacing?
I get it.
This flick wasn't even accurate, at all.
Wyatt Earp with no mustache?
Not horrible but reality is, this was good when we didn't know better.Get TOMBSTONE!
Listen.
That being said.
Yawn!
It lasted 30 seconds in reality and the list goes on.The sets, bad.
5 min fight at the O.K.
Corrall?
You can't compare a movie made in 1957 to a movie like Tombstone.
Next to THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, it's the best western ever made.
Kurt Russell as Wyatt and Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday (he should have gotten an Academy Award} that's the story you wanna see.Pass on this.
And Kirk Douglas as Doc?

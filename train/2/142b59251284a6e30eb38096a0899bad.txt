There was no mention of her fear of heights.
The book also doesn't mention some of the things that were very important to Kel in Squire, Page, and First Test.
Her treatment of Tobe and several of the others in the camp reflects this.
I didn't like that part.
ended.
It was like Kel was truly a noble, and not someone who was kind and fair to people.
.
The climax was built up remarkably well, but the book just.
Though she was very fair in her treatment with people in this book.
In this book, Kel seems more superhuman, and less kind towards people.
While it was a wonderful tribute to those who died in 9-11, the book itself was sadly lacking.
I thought this book was good,but not as good as Pierce's previous books.
The book did not play as heavily on her faults as the others did.
In Lady Knight, it seemed that Kel's attitude changed,and she seemed less human.

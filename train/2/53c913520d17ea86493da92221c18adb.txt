It seemed like a cheap gimmick for an expensive glove.
Nice way to treat a customer.
I guess this is a good thing in the long run, but I just wasn't prepared for how long this would take to break-in.
After taking it out of the box, the first thing you notice is the stiffness of the leather.
When I tried to contact someone about the broken "Dial-Fit", I was given the run-around.
I've been hearing about Wilson A2000 gloves for years.
I bought this for my son for Christmas.
After finally buying one, I must say I'm disappointed.
2 - Wilson's service is a joke.
Other complaints: 1 - the "Dial-Fit System" broke very early on.
I figured I'd better get going if my kid going to be able to use it by spring.
He mostly used his cheap, too small for him glove that I bought 3 years ago.
Right away, I started oiling it, and tying it up and playing "catch" with myself.
Here I am in June, and it's still not broken in well.
Then they just stopped responding.

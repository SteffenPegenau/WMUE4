If only Fabio was an elf.That said, it is a heck of a premise.
I'd love to see a rewrite.
But for me, all the rest just bogged it down.The world she created is an interesting one.
This would have really drawn me to the author.
But, the mix lost me as a reader.
You bet!
Doomed?
The characters are interesting.
Others might find her romance side as equally attractive.
This is a cross between Fantasy and Romance.
It is an excellent bit of fantasy when that is allowed out.
I got engrossed by fantasy side only to see it switch genres again and again.
Unrequited?
Love?
Sure, just over there.
Grab a hankie and head over there and there and there.

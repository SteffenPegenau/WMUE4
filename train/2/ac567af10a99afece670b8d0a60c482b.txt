In addition, people said they can hear me very well.
It'll tell you ie.
is messed up!
: The first reviewer was correct!
I simply cannot live with the stupidity of the way this caller I.D.
MEMORY: There's only room for 50 numbers in memory, not 99 as I read (I believe on Amazon).3.
1.
SOUND: The speakerphone is outstanding, one of the best I've heard yet!
It does NOT show you the calls in order!
CALLER I.D.
Thank you!
works!
I want to know who the new calls are right NOW, not in 10 minutes after tremendous eye stress trying to scroll thru 50 numbers to see who was a new caller.2.
Lastly, the handset is also good quality.SUMMARY!
What takes 2 seconds on most phones takes you several minutes to do with this phone.
While the speakerphone was great, I did return this phone.
The caller I.D.
THIS IS HORRIBLE!
3 new calls, but if they've called you in the past, you have to scroll thru all the phone numbers and look at dates & times that people called.

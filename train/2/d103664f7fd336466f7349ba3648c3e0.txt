The menace implied by the European vampires never really seemed all that menacing.
I couldn't find a real climax to any of the action.
When I got to the end of the book I had to go back and check.
It suffers from too much exposition and dialog.
I dislike when authors assume you'll read every anthology they contribute to.
They are talking in the kitchen.
I was disappointed by this entry in Mary Janice Davidson's Undead series.
They are talking in the bedroom.
I think that's the point.
Betsy's self-centered whining is starting to get old, and there seemed to be a chapter I missed somewhere along the line.
There really didn't seem to be much actual action at all.
Undead and Unpopular lacks any real tension.
They are talking in the parlor.
The action in this book was sorely missing.
Probably some short story in an anthology.

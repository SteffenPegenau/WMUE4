Her songs are just as generic as some other artist.
And, one thing why asians will never make it here in US?
Originality here comes first, and of course good music.
Its either the artists will be blamed or the media.
Asian thingy!
Sorry to say, She didnt make it here in the U.S.
!
not just by copying others craft.
Its like they cant be what should they supposed to be and not taking ones name to gain popularity.
She has an interesting voice may not be compared to Mariah, Whitney or Celine but you will know that she owns it.
You know?
Its her trademark.
unsurprising and not convincing enough to American Market.
Here in America, competition comes first.
Shes only popular to her own fellow asians(mostly chinese i suppose) Voice quality?
Shes not pretty but American loved her songs.
one instance, Macy Gray, good music and creativity.
coz they always compare theirselves to foreign artists.

"I'm very disappointed in this and in JC.
So when I say the album is filled with too much sex, this is what I mean.I am truly disappointed with his work here and if I could return it I would.
"I want to Masturbate with you!
He was always my favorite in N'sysc.
Great dance beats, fast and slow.
Why sing about Masturbating?It's not very romantic.It's not something I would write to my girlfriend in a Valentine's Day Card.
When I listen to music I always sing along; out loud or to myself.
Or dance to it.
The music on this album is great.
And yet I was very disappointed when I listened to it.The lyrics just have too much sex in it.
I Have eagerly awaited JC's new album.
I can't sing along with this album.When I say too much sex, I mean verses like in the song "Come To Me."
Be my valentine.
...Now, while I would defend anyone's right to Masturbate, I simply cannot sing that.
His voice and singing style is awesome.
He is so very talented.

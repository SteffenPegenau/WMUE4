.
The plot chugs along at an agonizingly slow pace.
And the world was beautiful and interesting.
A good editor should have eliminated a quarter of the pages, which would have improved the pacing.
Even the action scenes are sluggish, rather than exciting.
It's a shame no one did, because the idea is worth the effort.
I didn't even read the back page to see how it ended, which shows how bored I was.
I stopped half way through and put it back on the shelf.
I read stacks of books every month, and it's extremely rare for me to stop in the middle .
Instead, the intriguing concept fails due to the slow pace.
The concept for this story is very promising--one boy DOESN'T have magic, as opposed to the predictable boy who DOES have magic.
but this one did me in.

Sorry.
I tried skipping every other sentence.
But the writing was so sluggish, I couldn't get into it.
The paragraphs were too loooooong for the target age group.

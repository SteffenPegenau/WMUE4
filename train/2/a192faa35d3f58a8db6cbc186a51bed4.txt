We both said the same thing, it isn't Josh.
That's when I saw Josh and remembered I had the concert!!
Since I'm taking voice and going to a performing arts school, I've been a fan because Josh is young too.
Dunno.
All I really know is that I didn't like this DVD.
I feel so bad doing this but his DVD is really bad.
My mom bought the Greek album set for me two weeks ago and I just watched it today.
It makes me so sad because he was so darling and a terrific singer.
I could cry!!
He needs to get a voice coach and go back to his exercises.
What's happened to him and why?
This is Josh??
Or maybe I'm just outgrowing him.
I ran to put it in the player and saw someone totally different.
Then we realized it was.
How horrible.
omg!!
I forgot I had the concert until my mom told me about a progrm on Arts & Entertainment this morning.

Not one I thought was that Viola was the Earl's [...] and things go down hill from there.
Both characters delightful.
I love the first half of the book.
REALLY strange bad read.
He offers to marry and protect her with his family's name still not good enough.
Ferdinand can't talk sense to her.
I don't think I will be buying her books for her name.
This my first book by Mary Balogh.
This not the worst book I have read but it's still pretty bad.
Viola turns mean and nasty.
His sister and sister in law come to talk to her STILL not good enough.
Then we find out Viola secret.
He offers to give her home back not good enough for her.
I like a book with a LOT of drama but it must be believable for me to enjoy it.
It really made no sense.
It the middle of the book ruins it.
No Man's Mistress has a sweet ending.
COME ON!I really don't understand why Ferdinand loved her after she changed.

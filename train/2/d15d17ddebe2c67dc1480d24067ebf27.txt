Performance standards today are much higher.
I bought many of the Casals CD's from Perpignan and none leave a favorable lasting memory.
She rushes all of the technical spots and covers up a lot of mistakes.
In fact, the Concerto #20 played by Yvonne Lefebure is downright sub-standard.
The sound reproduction is pre-stereo and the playing is just so-so in the first one.
I'm sure the War was a major contributor to this.
Generally, I think Casals was overrated along with many of the performers of that time.
When I think of great Mozart Piano Concerto CD's, the one that comes to mind is Geza Anda with the Salzburg Mozarteum orchestra.
Serkin's sounds better!
This is definitely a CD that one won't want to listen to over and over again.
He plays all 27 beautifully and exact with phenomenal technic!
They play these with such crudeness and roughness!
Also, the orchestra sounds subpar.
Definitely not up to today's standards.
Entrances are so abrupt.

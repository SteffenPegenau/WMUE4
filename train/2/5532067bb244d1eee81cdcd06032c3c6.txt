It suffered from a bit of a slow down.
This game is really bad.
The next biggest flaw is this games sound.
Terrible.
You almost have to come to a complete stop to turn around and get to your target.
So, out of a perfect 5.0 I give this game on:graphics: 3.5sound: 2.0control: 1.5fun factor: 2.5
But hey, it's pretty jello!
The graphics are nice.
The jet-skis sound like old used cars.
It looks more like jello.
The water is beautiful but it doesn't look like water.
I did have trouble with the graphics when there was a lot of action on the screen.
I was hoping it would be as good or better than Splashdown but I was horribly wrong.
I know what they are supposed to sound like.
It is extremely difficult to get your jet-ski to turn in this game.
The first flaw I saw in this game was the control.
I own a jet-ski.

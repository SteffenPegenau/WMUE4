I used the web to find all sorts of reviews.
Then I asked about the type of memory.
He climbed a ladder to find the box, and still we couldn't make heads or tails of the info.
Nothing specifically mentioned the memory.
I thought: "What's the catch?"
What do you do when on vacation and you simply MUST buy another mem card?
If you are not concerned about this issue, then definitely buy this camera.
Honggang Ma is exactly right.
With this camera, NOTHING!
This settles the issue for me.
Be aware though, this is a "point & click" snapshot camera only.
I saw this product in a store.
The store clerk had no idea.
Loved it's simplicity, 3.1 Mpixels for an incredible price.
Then I found the previous review here at Amazon (GREAT reviews).
You will not find a higher resolution for the price.

Probably one previously owned by another reviewer who said they sent theirs back.
However, I have no doubt I was sent a used one when I paid for a new one.
I ordered this is plum from amazon.
I will need to buy different butter or just use it without the lid.
It depends on the butter you get.
I love my fiestaware but this piece was a disapointment.
I decided to keep it since who knows what may be wrong with another one if I tried to get a replacement.
At my request the new one was wrapped seperatly.
When it arrived the bottom had major glazing flaws, white spots in 2 places.
It smelled funny and has water spots and lots of dirt.
Amazon sent out another right away.
I read some reviews where people say its too small, some say its perfect.
Obviously a mistake on their part.
They shipped the 2 pieces wrapped together, nothing seperating them.
It is too small for the butter I buy.
The dish arrived chipped on the top part because of the way it was wrapped.

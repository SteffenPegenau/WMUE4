I was forced to control characters I didn't like and watch as the computer (poorly) controlled the ones I did like.
BTW, forget how much I disliked the gameplay, how is this a greatest hits in 2011 when it was released in spring of 2010?
I guess I'll just head back to ME2 and DA2.
However, I didn't want to actually play the game to get there.
There was an "autofight" button that I had to rely on in order to maximize my battle score.
Why isn't prototype a greatest hit or mass effect 1?
The gameplay was just atrocious.
Well that was a waste of $20.
I wasn't having any fun.
In fact my control was laudable.
Thus using the autofight button is almost required.
The story was way past kewl and I kept wanting to know what happened next and stuff.
It just took all the fun out of it.
This game sucked.
Yes each battle is scored, meaning that the less time it takes to win, the better your rewards may be.
I really should have listened to the negative reviewers.

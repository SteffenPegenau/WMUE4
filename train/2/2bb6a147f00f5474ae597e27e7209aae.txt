But from the size of the box you'd swear it was at least 15.
Not much is really hashed out.
Along with Outlaw Star, (Which I disliked after about episode 14), this anime will probably never be watched by me again.
Also only one episode on each disc, and episodes are only 30 minutes long.
Watch on the internet somewhere, or better yet just forget about.
I missed this years ago and thought I was making a good purchase.Don't waste your hard earned money on this.
Plus ending is very unsatisfying.
Also you never really get attached to any characters.
I bought only because the promos off Toonami years ago looked good.
I may even sell it someday, something I never do with movie purchases.You have been warned.Hope this review pursuades you to spend you money on something else.
This comes on double sided DVD's also, which I hate.
Not very entertaining, very short.
Brief review.
This Anime is only 3 episodes long.
The anime is not very good.

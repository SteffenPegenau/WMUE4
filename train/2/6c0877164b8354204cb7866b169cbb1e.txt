NOT worth the list price (hence only 2 stars).
I agree that this is just hodge-podge of unrelated programs.
Some are much better than others.
I picked it up for my kids to use over the summer for something to do to and as a review.
It has bugs and is very, very poor quality instruction.
They are both middle school students.
It even runs on NT.
They found the math very confusing and the rest pretty easy.
I got it at a discounted price.
The biggest nuisance is the quality of the math program.
The foreign language program is basically flashcards.
My goodness, if your student struggles with math, poor instruction is the last thing he needs!
A good review for a 6th grader, not higher.
I did not have the installation issues mentioned by others.
Probably worth it.
The vocab and grammar programs are cute.
Good review, but zero instruction.

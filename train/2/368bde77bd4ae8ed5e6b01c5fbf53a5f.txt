The people are too pretty.
I wasn't looking at the character Brand was supposed to be, I was looking at Russell Brand.
And far too often their personalities overwhelm characters they portray.
Maybe it's the glitz of film musicals.
I am in the latter group.
There are people who don't.
Maybe it's Hollywood.
On stage and live makes musical theater, musical theater.
Just close your eyes and listen.
There are people who love to see musicals in the cinema.
Whatever the 'it' is, I quit looking at it 2/3 through.
Who was Brand in the film anyway?Why did I watch?
I love the music.
I did.
(The only musical I ever enjoyed on film was The King and I.)
He acted like the Russell Brand I see when David Letterman interviews him.
Hollywood is too slick.
Maybe it's Tom Cruise.

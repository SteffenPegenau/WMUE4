Im gettin money from Amazon.
I recommend emailing them, wait two days, and then call Amazon.
In the long run, this will save you time and money.
Well, when I received this order, the flashlight and scope were completely busted.
Well, I know you don't want to hear it but you really have to just save up an extra 70 bucks or so and by a JG or something.
What a hassle.
Company would not accept my return!
Seriously, this is ridiculous!
Getting back to the company is hard!
They will make the company respond.
Also, the gun's clip can slip out so you have to hold the clip for it to stay in.
Hope I helped... don't buy from Airsoft Central.
Peace........................UpdateTwo weeks later.
There is no phone number and they don't respond to emails.
I should be getting my money back, or at least amazon said so.
But wow.
But at least I can sell the parts of the gun on ebay lol.

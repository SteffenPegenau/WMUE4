They also seemed to chip very easily.
They are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways.
Never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them.
After years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them.
Maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable.
They also are not good in the microwave.
I would not recommend for everyday use.
They get very hot and the food not so much.
We have owed these plates in white for quite some years.
I just replaced all of them with a set from Crate and Barrell.
So between the chips and marks all over them I couldn't take looking at them anymore.
First my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark.
I will never buy these again.
My advice is to purchase bone china or porcelain.
maybe six or more.

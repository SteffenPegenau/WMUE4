Such as: why does the Enterprise lower its shields every time it fires?
The beginning is excellent, then it degenerates into just another book.
So when I heard they were going to make a novel series about the Dominion War, I was excited.
And the Jem'Hadar ships are way too powerful.
The real highlight besides the beginning is the Corzanium.
That's a real original idea.
It never had to before.
If it was a battleship, I'd undestand.
I was hoping for a lot of action, and there is, but there are some strange things.
Besides that, it's an average book.
But you don't see those alot in the Dominion fleet.
When I read the first story, Behind Enemy Lines, I thought it wasn't very good.
So one Jem'Hadar ship couldn't possibly destroy an Ambassador-class starship, unless it was a battleship.
Deep Space Nine is the best Star Trek series, and I've watched all of them, even that pathetic Voyager series.
But no matter what, I wish L.A. Graf would've written this.

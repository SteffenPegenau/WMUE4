From the picture it just looks like this one is missing the diaper holder.
This one is terrible to put together.
I bought the deluxe first for my changing area and its been great.
It's just okay now that it's assembled.
And I am pretty handy with these things.
Boy am I sorry.
I couldn't really tell the difference between the two versions at the store.
Where the deluxe one will have future uses, just snaps together and it overall a MUCH better product.
Munchkin makes two versions of this cart.
It took me 45 minutes of frustration and power tools before I gave up and let my husband finish it.
So I bought it to save $10.
Only took me a few minutes to put together and has held up well.
It holds the clothes and when his room remodel is finished I'll probably toss it.
I needed a temporary place to store some of my older son's clothing so I went to buy another.
This one and a deluxe version.

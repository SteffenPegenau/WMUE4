Noise cancellation is pretty decent.
They look a lot like the first Bose version, but are a bit bigger.
I could not change that].The headphones basically do what they claim to do.
Sound I would rate a 6 or 7 on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being best).
When I unplug the Ipod from the wall power source, the buzzing stops.
[Please note: I give this product 4 stars, not 2.
There is a minor problem with the NC, though.
I like the design.
The batteries go into the headphone part, so there is no clumsy "battery box" externally, which is nice.
If that bugs you, I would not recommend them.
Would be good on a plane trip if you are not a "snob" in terms of sound.
They are light and comfortable.
But they are decent when you are not hooked into a wall power source, and are very similar to Bose's NC headphones, which cost about 6 times more.
I can recommend them, for this price.
When mine is turned and I am plugged into a laptop or Ipod, I get a loud buzzing noise.

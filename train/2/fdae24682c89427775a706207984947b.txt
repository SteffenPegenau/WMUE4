If you're looking for an out-of-the-box bike, this ain't it.
I took the bike to my local shop and they could not get it to work much better than I.
I put the bike on a stand and got to work.
I got this bike for my 7 year old for Christmas.
Total cost for this with labor was $[...].
Now it shifts great.
Cons: Won't Shift!
After about an hour, the cable would just kink up in the handlebar.
Rather than deal with returning the bike, I had the shop change the deraileur and handlebar shifter to a SRAM unit.
It was also VERY hard to turn the shifter.
If you're willing to replace some stuff, it's still cheaper than buying it from a bike shop.
Pros: Cheap Bike.
I worked for 2 hours but was never able to get it to shift properly.
I put it together in about 30 minutes, but the bike wasn't shifting very well.
I am a bike enthusiast and work on my and my wife's road bikes, so I know a bit about adjusting shifting.

I've had my zip code for almost 4 years...Topo says it's invalid.
Doesn't recognize new zip codes or towns.
Big oversight by Magellan.
No problems there for me.
I've had MapSend Topo for about a week now and I'm not impressed with it for the following reasons: 1.
Can't find my friend's zip in VA either.
By the way, it's the same for MapSend Streets.
2.
3.
No maps larger that 8Meg and only 4 of those or the GPS unit will lock-up.
Too many bandaids and work-arounds to get a map into the GPS.
Haven't tried that yet but I'll take Magellan's word on it...By the way, it does work with WindowsXP.
Why would anyone purchase a topo software package and not want trails?
Doesn't contain trails.
Lots of rules here.
One would think that Magellan would have up-grades on their web site that would up-date things like cities and zip codes.

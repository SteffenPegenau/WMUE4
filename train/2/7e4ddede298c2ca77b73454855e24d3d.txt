It seemed like forever!"
My sharpest memory of this movie upon seeing it at a theatre at the time was, "Jeez, I can't believe it was only 90 minutes!
Ok, not exactly timeless classics.
It does have a terrific cast: Schell, Ernest Borgnine, Yvette Mimmiuex, Robert Forester, Anthony Perkins, Joseph Bottoms.
A pity.
Two stupidly "cute" robots -- the voices of Roddy McDowell and Slim Pickens.
1979 ... let's see, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, METEOR, MOONRAKER, BUTCH & SUNDANCE THE EARLY YEARS, THE FRISCO KID.
Good cast but stilted dialogue undoes everything.
The ending, I guess, is some strange play on 2001.
But Disney touted this as their modern 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA and Schell's character as a modern Nemo.
Incredible work by Peter Ellenshaw on this intended space version of Verne's classic.
It just doesn't make it.
I'm not saying this movie is the worst thing ever done.
Hardly.
It also brought this very, very strange and dark entry from Disney.

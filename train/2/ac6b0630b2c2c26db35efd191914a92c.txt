However, I am not at all happy with Remington's version of a chainsaw.
The power was always acceptable.
This function could have been more robust.
The mechanism bent at first stress, and works no more.
The adjuster travels a plastic track, based on your turning of a thumbscrew.
The problem comes at the point when you (inevitably) need to adjust the tension in the chain.
I bought this tool 2-3 years ago, unsure of whether I really needed a chainsaw long term.
As I have trees on my lot and feed a woodstove, I have found the tool indespensible.
Too bad, as the motor and chain are still as good as ever.
The positive, and the negative, is simply: this tool is cheap.
Spend the extra money to get a real tool.
I liked the fact that it is quiet and emits no pollution at the point of use.
As they say, the bitterness of low quality lasts longer than the sweetness of a low price.
The tool is worth less without it.
The tensioner is worthy of a matchbox car, not a power tool.

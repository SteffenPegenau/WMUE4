When I initially got this item I was incredibly happy.
When I got it, I was so happy.
The chain was too small for me to wear comfortably, and for added protection, I doubled the hoop thing that the necklace goes through.
The main reason I wanted to buy it was to wear, but I don't want to wear it if it'll disintergrate on me, or have the bubbling become worse.Still.
I guess it seems kind of cheap.
Estatic even.
Much better than the picture.
And it kind of creeps me out.
I would liked to have rated this higher.
But, I guess it's still nice.
I don't know why.
First off.
Other than that, I was happy.But after wearing it a couple days, I've noticed the back of the pendant has started to wrap/bubble.
The only problems I had at first were minor.
It was beautiful.
I've been looking for something like this for a long time.

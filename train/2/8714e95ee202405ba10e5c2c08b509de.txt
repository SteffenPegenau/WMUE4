Now I have to pay to ship it back.
I thought this kind of thing was my we stoped buying from TAIWAN.
I tighten it down but was able to turn it conterclockwise and it unscrewed.
When the order arrived it had Taiwan stamped on it!!!
Looking at the picture it said Japan.
So the hole on the T-Mount from TAIWAN is not installed correct.
VERY UNHAPPY.
The locking pin on the camera will not lock in place.
Ok.
Still want know if it will be right one.
The locking pin works just fine with all my Lens.
No.
And wait until it comes back.
I ordered this t-mount thru Amazon.
No red dot, just a small hole drilled in it.So I was able to figure out how to install it, with out the red mark.
on the box was #93419 Canon EOS.

(I had the opposite experience with a Tokina 11-16.
See the reviews on photo.netThe body used was a d90.I emailed sigma-they offered to calibrate it, AFTER I filled out the warranty.
Sharp focus and corners quite sharp wide open.
But mine is excellent.
Meaning I could not return it.
There are also some bad copies, apparently, floating around.
If it works well for your body, great.
Still, I expect it to work as advertised out of the box.
I had very high hopes for this lens.
If you get a good copy, great.
)Since Amazon has a solid return policy, you can order one.
And, out of the box, beatifully constructed.
Not a risk I wanted to take.I really wanted this lens to work-but it had to go back.
Unfortunately, it front focuses repeatedly.
This is a known problem with some sigma 35/camera combo's.
If not, it's only a minor inconvenience to return it.
If they were unable to calibrate it, I could not return it.

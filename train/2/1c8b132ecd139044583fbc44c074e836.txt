I think I'll pass on this book, not unless someone gives it to me.
I thought to myself "I THINK I know who people are talking about".
Really ticking everybody off!
If so, There's really just one word for him.
He should do stand up.
Sure enough, I researched and realized that I DID read his other book, "why men cheat".
I actually read the reviews because I was THINKING about reading the book.
I thought the 1-star ratings were the most entertaining, so I gave him 1-star for effort and 2-stars for completion, but the reviews made me wonder, who is this guy?
Are you telling me he's serious?
I can always use a good laugh.
I also, saw the View interview.
With all the clues, particularly, the mention of the View.
IGNORANT!!
He was hilarious!!
I just assumed the guy was joking!
:-)

It's actually just weak crunk and snap beats just like every other rap album nowadays.
Pass this one up.
But no, most of the songs sound exactly the same kind of like D4L's album only worse.
Because the truth is, there is no rock sound in this album.
If you want a good rap rock album, check out Hollywood Undead - Swan Songs.
Before this album came out I had high expectations.
So I expected the rest of the album to be completely different.
So overall, Rockstar Mentality falls short of all expectations.
It really could have been better than it was.
And I wasn't right or wrong.
I thought this was going to be the first rap group in a long time to mix rock with their music and not be terrible.
I heard Party Like A Rockstar a long time before this album came out and that song is good as a single but I figured it wouldn't be the best on the album which it was.
A few songs were good, but the album as a whole fails.
Its not even worth listening to.
The lyrics are especially terrible.

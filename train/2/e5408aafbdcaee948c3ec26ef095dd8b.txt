I like Raven and all..But when she sings, not a A+ Singer to me.
And now, in her new album, she stole What Is Love from Play!
on her That's So Raven show, but when it's singing, just forget about it!
Trust me.
AGAIN!
Anyways, I know Raven is a good person and all, its just...(sigh)....
They have better voices!
She stole like 2 songs!
And I got all pissed!
I love her on t.v.
On Cheetah Girls, they stole Cinderella from Play!
Like when Raven sings their songs, she doesn't sing with a lot of power as Play does.
I'm a big big fan of Play and I don't respect Raven for doing that.
Buy this cd for all I care!
Sorry if this doesn't help, but I'm just giving you some advice, just please hear Play's original version.
I mean get the cd if you want but, just saying, you should check out Play's original version of Cinderella and What is Love.

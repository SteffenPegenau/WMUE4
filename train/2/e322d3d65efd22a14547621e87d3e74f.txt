Thinking it's some kind of new drug the teens pass it around without a second thought.
Until then we only see shadows of killings.
For one, the dogs talk in this movie.
This movie gets is ridiculous at times.
They have no real purpose but to try and be funny nothing else.
Overall Sweden failed attempt at a fun horror-comedy for the vampire genre.
This Swedish horror comedy about vampires that take over a town during what known as polar night.
I just can not recommend this one.
To make things worse the action does not pick up until the last 25 minutes or so in this film.
Yes they talk.
It does'nt take long before evryone begins to turn on each other.
This will of course mean the vampires have more timme to roam about town.
It is when the sun will remain down for up to 24 hours.
A pill manufactured by a vampire scientist that supposed to turn humans into vampires makes it way to a local party.
It has a bad script,editing, and video-game effects.

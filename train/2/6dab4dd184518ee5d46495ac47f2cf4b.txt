1 1/2 stars.
She was 33 years old when this was made.
Yeah, the documentary was done very competently.
Now it's April 2008.
Unbelievable.
----Okay...I can see from the other reviews that I'm reacting to the person rather than to the product.
Looks like she made it, after all.)
(Not to take away from her prowess as a businesswoman or promoter--no quarrel, there!)
She's never going to exit from adolescence, is she?
And I own the IMMACULATE COLLECTION album and love it.
Holy S***!
**(I wrote this little review in August 2005.
I just saw a Madonna interview where she talked about how self-centered she used to be and how glad she is that she's not like that anymore.
Terrific as a film record of American narcissism, crapshoot superstardom, and arrested development.
So I think what I said above is fair, except the part about growing up.
But Madonna, the person, is just soooooo annoying.
Enough said.

Evidently this is fiction.
"Spear of Destiny, etc."
Even then I thought this would be a film similar to WWII horror comics, e.g.
Disabled children resistance fighters?
The main character had flashbacks which is not explained why.
I borrowed the DVD based on the reviews here.
When did that happen?
because of the skeleton-faced Germans on the cover.
It had promise at the beginning but begins to fizzle out in the middle.
television series in the 60's was way better.
"Combat!"
C'mon.
I think it's overrated.
This was a waste of my time and money.
Let's get real.
If you really want to see a good WWII indie film you'd be better of with "When Trumpets Fade" and "Saints and Soldiers."

It now looks like any "new metal" cover, complete with Parental Advisory logo.
Like so many others, I sure as [heck] wasn't pleased with the Emergency Broadcast System Remix of These Boots.
And then there is the cover.
AT LEAST HALF THE SONG IS BLEEPED, AND THE WORDS AREN'T EVEN BAD!
Someone call me when they put out a REAL remaster of this album.
I don't see how anyone can like this album any more than Metallica's Kill 'em All.
I don't see what everyone sees in this re-release.
First of all, the album was never that good to begin with.
A good idea, BUT THE SOUND IS TERRIBLE!
And those early demo tracks?
Early Megadeth was never too good, and here it shows, with poor songs and poor production quality.
For the most part the whole album is generic thrash.
Only Last Rites/Loved To Death and Mechanix stand out.
Having demos of them WAS a good idea.
Aren't remasters supposed to REPAIR the quality of classic albums?

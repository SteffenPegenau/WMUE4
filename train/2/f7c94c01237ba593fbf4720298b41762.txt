I hope THE ELUSIVE FLAME with a grown up Beau will recapture her former glory!
All her heroines lately are petite and the most gorgeous thing walking the face of the earth.
It seems she's gone downhill from there.
I kept thinking Roxanne was Louisa.
The book is predictable, no real tension even though the main characters lived in the same house and don't make love until 3/4 through the book.
No one should be THAT perfect even in literature.
She should also try to make her female characters a little more 3-dimensional and realistic.
(sigh!)
THE WOLFE AND THE DOVE and SHANNA were also terrific and I've read them countless times.
Maybe I've outgrown her.
The one about the Russian princess I didn't even finish.
I was riveted from page one.
She used to be my favorite author, but not any more.
I first read THE FLAME AND THE FLOWER in 1971.
PETALS ON THE WIND has a lot of the same character types as FLAME but was not near as captivating.

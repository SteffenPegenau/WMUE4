The Running Man had promise.
are driven to compete on gameshow for the chance to get out of their terrible situation, but where ultimately no one ever wins.
But potential is all it has.
Of the Bachman Books, this is by far the worst story.
It's the story of a dreary future world where those who have no other choice due to poverty, illness, etc.
Nothing really captured my attention.
I typically love the Bachman Books, but this one was terrible.
I just wanted it over.
Don't buy this one on it's own.
It boggles the mind that this book has a higher rating than Roadwork (which is great, 5 stars, see my review).
I felt the story dragged on.
And if you don't win, you die.
I had a hard time finishing this book and by the end I really didn't care what happened to anyone.
If you must read this story, buy a copy of the Bachman Books and get 4 novels.
Even though the basic idea has been done many times before it still has the potential to be a great story.

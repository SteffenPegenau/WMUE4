Tippi Hedren (Melanie Danials) play your typical 1990's blonde in a 1960's movie.
This movie is nothing compared to Friday the 13th movies.
I guess the movie's special effect's were O.K.
I feel as if she is just there to look pretty and be somthing to look at.
I feel as if this movie cannot compare with a modern day horror film.
There was no ending.
My rating of this movie is ** (two stars)
When I see a movie I expect to have an ending.
Rod taylor's part as Mitch Brenner, would have been better if he had some better supporting actresses.
My opinion is that all of the birds sounded like a giant flock of Donald Duck's.
Where was the ending?
More action was needed during the first hour.
The Birds just left me hanging.
My general opinion of the film, the birds as a whole is that this movie would have been a great movie if I was from that era.
for that time.
I felt as if the plot could of been better because it took too long to get to the point.

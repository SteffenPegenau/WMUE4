This is one light stroller.
2nd, the cup holder for the kid pops out all the time.
We're going to buy a new one to replace it.
)Now the bad.
It's also very shallow so it's only good for a short sippy cup.
I'm not a fan either.
This thing is half the weight of a normal stroller and folded up it's much smaller too (think trunk space!
My wife hates this stroller.
I didn't realize how light until I had to use someone elses.
Mine pulls to the left always.
You cannot push this with one hand.
The basket on the bottom always comes undone and then it starts dragging on the ground.
It can only be folded with 2 hands, no one handed folding.So, pass pass pass on this stroller!
The straps are complicated and get tangled all the time.
First the good news.
Anything tall, including a bottle, will fall out when you hit a bump.
The sunshade is tiny and basically does nothing.
As others have said it does not want to go straight.

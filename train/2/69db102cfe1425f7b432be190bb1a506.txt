Where was the wit, and insight that fueled me through High Fidelity?
I was amazed at Hornby's ability to absolutely nail the male psyche in such a clear manner.
This book made me think, laugh, and even cry a little.
Although this book was clearly written, it failed to inspire thought or concern.
What happened Hornby?
About a Boy was extremely anticipated after reading Hornby's first novel, High Fidelity.
I had picked up High Fidelity on a hunch an was amazed.
Please, please try again.
The plot didn't flow and try as I might, I absolutely didn't care about any of the characters.
With that in mind, I rushed to the store to purchase "About a Boy".
High Fidelity actually helped me come to terms with some of my "issues."
Never before had I identified myself so much with a literary character.
Eagerly awaiting the next one- joe
What I discovered left me sadly disappointed.
They wear dull, lifeless, and uninspiring.

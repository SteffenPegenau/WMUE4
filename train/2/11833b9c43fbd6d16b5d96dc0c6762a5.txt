NOT FRUSTRATING!!!
the control is part of it .
Thats what playing games is all about, Right?
I think HALO really spoiled me!!
)I was having fun playing this game until I got to the first boss Vampire (FAUSTUS).
But I like my games to be (FUN!!!!!!!!!)
This boss has an energy bar that is about ten times larger that yours , He blocks every blow you throw at him, Many of his blows you can`t block and some will drop you in about two hits!You are lucky if you get in two or three hits!!
I also want to say that I was a big fan of Soul Reaver 1 .
It is rather clunky.
They all seem to be like this (frustrating).
The game should not make you want to pull the disc out and smash it!
I have fought FAUSTUS about thirty times and still have yet to beat him !
Parts of HALO can be rather hard to get through but it is still fun!
I first want to say that I love a good chalange .
This will be my LAST Eidos game .
I may take this game back or trade it for store credit.

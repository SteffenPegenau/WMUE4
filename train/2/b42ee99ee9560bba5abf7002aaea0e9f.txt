Here are some techno drums.
But here are even TWO guitarists, and they don't really know how to play guitar !!!
She goes pop in this album.
I think it's missing some guitar solos.
She screams a lot, so I didn't give her 4 stars.
I can't hear here a lot of bass.
And this isn't really punk rock.
I was very dissapointed of this CD.
I DON'T recommend to buy this album.
Excuse me !
It's missing some bass.
And here is only one punky song.
If the guitarists would play any guitar solos, this would be perfect.
This punk album is fair.
It could be better.
It's SK8ER BOI.
And what I also don't like, are the drums.

It would have worked out as more interesting if Ayla were only average looking like a mortal, for god's sake.
Yeah, we know.
Thonolan seemed so much more in-depth as a character.
EVERYTHING HAS ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN!And Jondalar.
I hate Jondalar now.
It's so old!
And, I'm sorry, do we need to know of his "eager member" or whatever she calls it?Ugh.I'm utterly disappointed.
Jondalar is a pretty boy, the end.
If Ayla was a modern woman she would be in constant therapy because of those.
He's horrible.
The sex scenes are so...graphic.
Ayla meets lots of people, people are afraid of her inventions and animals, people begin to understand, one person refuses to be friendly with Ayla.
And he's such a sexaholic!
It's really the plotline from "Plains of Passage" and "Mammoth Hunters" redone with new characters.
I eagerly awaited this book and- flop.
And the whole thing with her hallucinations being "special".

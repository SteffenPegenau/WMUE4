NOT Purple/Blue.
The low beams are a nice color of white.
DO NOT BUY.
Packaging, marketing, high price, make them seem "better" than the rest.
The high beams are also White, not blue at all.
They DON'T look anything like real HID's.
RIP OFF.
Not as bright as my old cheap bulbs.
I bought these off of tire rack for $73 plus shipping.
Anyone who would confuse the two must be blind, or just retarded.
You have been warned.
I was really excited about these "high performance" bulbs, but it was all hype.
I had DOT Approved $15 lights that outshined these EXPENSIVE bulbs by a wide margin.
$82 total.
Plus, it is not very BRIGHT.

I can't read this book before I go to sleep.
It's not a soothing experience.
Nobody wants a rotting princess full of worms, either.
It's dark; but some people like that kind of thing.
I don't find it to be an erotic book in any sense of the word - it is more aggressive than feeling.
(Gee, I think I would take THE FONZ over this prince, any day!)
In fact?
"Aaaayyy!"
The writing is not bad, but the approach is cynical.
I could do without being so much in the prince's "head", or the evil fairy's "head" - especially before bedtime.
Actually, it gives me a feeling that the author does not really like females, and is taking out his aggression on the fair sex by these writings.
On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest rating I could give, I rate this book a 7.
What ever happened to the other fairies?
the prince does everything short of squatting in front of a mirror to comb his hair back like "The Fonz" from Happy Days, before meeting the princess.
They aren't here.
It's hard to stay with.

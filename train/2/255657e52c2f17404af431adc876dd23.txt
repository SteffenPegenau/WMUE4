Microsoft keeps your nickel.So in reality the price of the songs are more than iTunes, but they don't tell you that.
Each song costs $0.99, so Microsoft keeps your $3.02 in it's back account until you spend it.
Now say you buy 5 songs at once.
If you don't spend all your points Microsoft still gets the money and keeps it until you do.
Microsoft does not tell you about the hidden pricing.
If you buy 2, it's $2.50 a song.
You have to buy $5 worth of points from Microsoft.
If you buy just one song, it's $5.
At .99 a song that comes to $4.95.
If you buy 5, it's a dollar each.
The player is nice, if a little large.
It's this kind of if not downright deceptive then misleading practice that makes me shy away from the player.
Say you want two songs.
The store is terrible.
You have to buy a package of points.

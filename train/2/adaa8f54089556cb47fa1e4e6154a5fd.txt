It was kind of hard to understand.
I'll tell you that all the good parts are in the beginning and the end.
I rate the story on a scale from one through ten it would be a six.
I really did not like the story at all.
The kids are out of school for spring break.
Then they go fishing at the lake near Mississippi.
I think that you might like this book better me.
I hate Harry Potter and this one.
It is flat out not good enough!
It was too old for me.
I thought it was boring.
The critique is the main thing of the story.
It is not fun or cool at all.
I would compare this to Harry Potter.
It was pretty easy to read.
The reason the why I rate it a six is because it was not well put together.

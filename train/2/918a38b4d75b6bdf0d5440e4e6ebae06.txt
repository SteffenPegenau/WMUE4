It's very pop and very mainstream.
O.A.R.
does not.
I am going to see O.A.R.
They shot themselves in the foot with an album like this but I hope to God O.A.R.
More than half of the reviews state the same.
PLEASE reconsider your path!
If any of you have ever heard of Suicide Machines you will know what I mean.
I am just simply shocked.
The fans are where its at, why disappoint them?
in Denver Oct 21st, 2005 and I really hope I do not hear any of their new stuff.
Granted I just bought this CD, however after listening to it I an EXTREMELY skeptical.
This is the first review I have ever written, as I am that disappointed.
Continuing down this path will put them back to playing in the corner bar or broken up completely.
is my favorite band and this is not them.
Consider this, one "mainstream" album may sell better, however if it puts you out of business was it worth it?

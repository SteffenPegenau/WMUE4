So, there it sits, unwatched.
Bought the DVD and went to watch it myself first to see if I remembered it.
Please don't short change the people who made you who you are today.
The quality of the movie is so poor that I didn't finish watching it.
What are they thinking?
You are the conglomerate you are now because of your customers.
Big disappointment.
I don't understand it.
Your loyal customers deserve better.
Very sad.
Disney did a wonderful job creating the film.
Shame on you, Disney.
It was just too grainy and hard to look at.
Having seen this movie as a kid, and LOVED it, I was ready to show it to my Grandkids.
Why make such a poor DVD of it?
But the quality shouldn't get any stars at all.
I rated this 2 stars because I loved the movie.
Didn't show it to the Grandkids.

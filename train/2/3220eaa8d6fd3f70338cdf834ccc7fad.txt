The movie was set back in 1876.
I wouldn't never went out and rented it.
Of course, they died.
It was not a movie that I would recommend to other people.
There were a few parts that was interesting.
If you ever had trouble sleeping then this is the movie to watch.
I didn't like it but everybodys opinion is different.
I don't recommend you go out and rent it.
I thought it was interesting to see if they were going to live or die.
Sean Connery played a vicious man who tried to destroy the coal miners and their business.
It made me fall to sleep, but like I said, there were a few interesting parts.
There are some people who might like it.
For instance, the scene where some of the coal miners were crushed to death in the coal mine.
Although Sean Connery did play a wonderful part it still wasn't a very good movie.
The Molly Maguires was an alright movie.
Our history teacher made us watch it.

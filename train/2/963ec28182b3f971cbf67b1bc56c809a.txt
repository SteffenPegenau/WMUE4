Annoying.
I am a tea drinker.
I agree that the Zarafina is pretty and looks nice on my counter and I will agree that it makes a good cup of tea (no better than my Mrs Tea!)
The brewed tea cools off fast and I'm forced to put the cup in the microwave to warm it up.
I also do not like that there isn't a warming element.
I don't care how careful you are.
Lastly, I use loose tea and each and every cup has major tea debri in it.
Oh, and another thing, the litlle tiny pot cannot pour without spilling.
I'm in the process of searching for a new tea maker.
First and foremost it does not brew enough tea, and it takes forever!
I get two cups of tea and then I'm brewing another pot, and another and another.
I'll sell my Zarafina on eBay.
I received this as a Christmas gift from my husband as a replacement for my Mrs Tea that finally passed away after probably 15 years of service.
but that's where my fondness ends.
Give me some tea!

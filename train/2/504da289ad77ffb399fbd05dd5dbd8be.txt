Guess what happens about ten times a day?
They get bumped.
You can buy new ones over and over and they will break.
You cannot help banging against them all the time.
Simple.
They get loose.
The problem is where they are installed: on the end of your faucet.
They make perfectly good filtered water but they don't last because they mount in the worst place possible: right where you wash your dishes.
It doesn't matter whether it is the Brita or the PUR.
Get the countertop pitcher and be done with it.ekw
They break.
They start to leak.
They get banged.
I guarantee it.
They get whacked.
That's it.

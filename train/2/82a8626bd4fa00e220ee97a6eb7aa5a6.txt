Well, almost two years later, it started to get scratchy lines and now I cannot read the text.
My kindle was a gift two years ago.
.
.
I know at least five people who purchased a kindle after talking with me about how much I loved it.
maybe they will not break so quickly.
An avid reader, I was skeptical, but soon converted and loved, loved, loved my kindle.
I am disappointed and going to investigate other readers and things like the iTouch.
I think hardware should last longer than just about two years, especially given the cost.
I waxed romantically whenever I spoke of it.
.
.
Amazon will sell me a refurbished original for $99, but no discount on Kindle 2 or the DX.
.
Since it is a fault of their design and product, I think they should reward customers who willingly tried the first edition (especially when it cost so much) and at least provide a discount on the new technology.

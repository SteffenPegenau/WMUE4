What happened?
The only track worth listening to is Dirtier Than the Next.
I can only hope that No Warning comes back to their senses and a.)
b.
Don't listen to all the Projekt Revolution reviewers.
gets back on a hardcore label, preferably Bridge Nine.
c.) stops printing this abomination.
I'm not joking either, it's freaking depressing.
)stop acting like they are linkin park(sum 41 for that matter).
If you're a fan of the old No Warning don't get this, it'll make you cry.
Ill Blood and their S/T were two of the greatest hardcore albums to come out within the last couple of years.
Even that gets pretty 'linkin parkish' towards the end.
I remember when No Warning was one of the best new bands in hardcore.
Bunch of 13 year old girls who know nothing about hardcore.
Disappointing.....very very disappointing.

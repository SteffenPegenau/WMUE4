The whole war seemed to be fought by 50 of the same people.
Gregory peck should be ashamed, though he did a splendid job of acting the script was un-believable.
OK people.
I will never watch it again so Im going to sell this.
No way could this be rated five stars.
This really took away from the reality of the whole mess.
Now that I think about it.
Blue and Grey is a joke compared to them.
Again, I watched it.
Stacy keach did a great job of acting.
I made the mistake of watching Maxwells Gettysburg and God and Generals.
All other movies cant compare to those.
Sorry but it was corny as hell.
I watched the whole thing and thank god I had a fast forward button that was used quite often.
The Geyser family did not make you feel like they were a real family.
Anyone who did is way to easy to please.
Uniforms were ridiculous.
I really should have given this series one star.
Those were the BEST EVER MADE SO FAR!

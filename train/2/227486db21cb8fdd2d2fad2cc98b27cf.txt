I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring.
It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.
In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.
I was not impressed.
Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time.
This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.
Great Expectations was a mediocre book.
The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.
If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens.
I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.
Every chapter was boring.
Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?
I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.
It was too long and boring.
STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!

The playsets have just enough activity to start an idea for play and leave the rest for the childs imagination.
We love them!
I am so glad hasbro brought back mlp.
These playsets are great.
My daughter has collected them for about four years now.
I found all of them to be great.
If you want less space taken up buy a polly pocket.
Don't let the mlp line go away again,please.
They require IMAGINATION!They are not babysitters to prop your child in front of.My daughter is eight and her and the ponies enter a world of imagination that lasts for days!
Yes you set them up and leave them.
Keep up the good work hasbro.
We have the 80's playsets and the new ones.
I love to watch my daughter play with the playsets and I join in on the fun too!
They are also not mindless push a button video games.
But these are not toys for toddlers or very young children.They are plastic and do of course break.

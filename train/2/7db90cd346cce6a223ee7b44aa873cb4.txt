The overall quality is that of a mediocre home movie, made by a stoner in 1966.
Just don't expect a whole lot.
etc.
But there's no getting around it, folks.
As for insights into Syd's makeup/development as an artist/psychedelic experiences/etc.
Sure, there are some groovy shots of Syd gettin' high in the hills, but not very many.
Not many at all.
That's right, 10.
And that, honestly, is kind.
Syd's on screen for maybe 6.
And there are an awful lot of shots where (a) Syd is nowhere to be seen, and (b) you, the viewer, don't have a clue as to what the hell is going on.This disc is all of 10 minutes long.
Look, I dig Syd and his music as much as the next guy.
etc.......pretty much zilch.
If you gotta have it, you gotta have it.
This one is pretty doggone cheesy.

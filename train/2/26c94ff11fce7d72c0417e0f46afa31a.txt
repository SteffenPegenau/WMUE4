I'm very disappointed.
MPX220 is definitely NOT the one you would expect from Motorola.
I have never written any review on any item.
But I feel very compelled to write one this time.
Outlook, ActiveSync, blue tooth, Media player and everything else pretty much works fine.
I always love moto phones especially they have good sound systems.
But I consider these are minor problems.
I loved this phone a lot but had to return it.
By the way, the ROM version on mine is 1.30.
Despite all of these great features, the low volume is unbearable.
The volume is sooo low on the earpiece, the speaker phone itself and the microphone.
There is a few glitches in the software here and there.
The side buttons are too big so sometime you may accidently change the setting.
It has everything I wanted, except the very basic feature of the phone, the speaker volume!
I will just have to wait until they come out with a new PDA phone.

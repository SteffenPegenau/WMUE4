I wonder why Jason Lee took that role.
The acting was not that good.
Tom Sisemore ...[was no good] The stroy line and plot were okay.
Now of his live-action movies have I liked.
This movie is just a let down and I do not recomend it any one....
Hevy D go back to the rap game.
Johnny Knockville was not funny like on "Jackass".
But this movie was just down right stupid.
Becuase he is allways funny in movies and in this movie his chactor was not funny buy I don't blame him I mean it's not his falut because the script was written every badly.
I expected a really funny movie.
This movie could have been funny with the cast but the script and directing were so bad it did not work.
Tim Allen, I hate to say it but he is washed up.
...This movie was short (85 mintues) but that was good because I could not take it any more.
Renne Russo has had two straight duds (the other "Showtime).
Omara Eeps who is a good actor, he can't do comedy.
"Big Trouble" was a big let down.

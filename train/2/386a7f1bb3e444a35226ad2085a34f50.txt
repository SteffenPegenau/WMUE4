Not the normal Harlequin Present Romance book.
The H showed his love for the h and was not ashamed of his feelings for the h. OK now the bad points!
I am big on closure!
Usualy M. Reid books she shows the H and H with so much more character.
I wished M. Reid had went it to some detail at least on some closure for the h. as far as the bad guys went.
VERY VERY slow.
were the bad guys ever punished??
were they ever caught??
I could not get through this book fast enough!
I mean something so traumatic you can not just simply forget about it in 3 years!
but it was a endearing story.
The good points of this book was was that Michelle Ried actually stepped out side of the box with this book.
I feel that this book lack so much of that!
The books was SLOW!
this book lacked so much of it!
Like why didn't she report the incident?

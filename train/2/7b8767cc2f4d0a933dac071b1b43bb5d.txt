Well, to start, it seems like a trendy move.
The irreligious sentiment?
True, some the characters are well-written, but with names like "Jordan Cross" I felt I was reading a publication by Zondervan.
Where's the fire?
There exists many novels of Xian suspense/thrillers on the market, and to be frank, this book seems to fall in line with the rest of them.
The depth and religious turmoil?
Ray Garton is a good writer, no doubt about it .
Frank E. Peretti comes to mind.
but Dark Channel is too lengthy and riddled with misconceptions on the New Age movement.
.
The macabre satire?
.
Not much can be found here.
you ask.
I enjoyed Ray Garton's books in the past, but I fell out of favor with this one.
I'm not a fan of New Age Fluff myself, but I can't imagine that Bael or the Dark One himself is behind it all.
The whole effort seems to be half-hearted and exhausting.
Why?

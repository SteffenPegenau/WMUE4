In February the motor went out and we had to get another one.
We love it because it swings two ways.
If he gets fussy swinging one way, we turn him around and swing him the other way.Now, the reason for the two stars: the motor went out... Twice!
Then just today, April 25, 07 the motor conked out AGAIN!We don't even turn on the lights for our baby because they distract him.
I think it's a flaw in the motor.Someone talked about this item not being sturdy.
My baby loves, loves, loves this swing.
We've never had any problems with it breaking down.
It has to stand on two legs because you need to turn the swing.
That's the only feature that is absolutely fantastic about it.
We purchased the first swing in December 06.
It doesn't feel sturdy but it is.
All he ever does is swing.
I don't think we got a lemon.... TWICE!
I'd stay away from it.If you can get another model that swings both ways, do that.
We only have motor issues.At $159 the motor should not go out.

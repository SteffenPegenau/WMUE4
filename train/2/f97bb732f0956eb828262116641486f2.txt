Funny.

I think they would be surprised how successful they would be if they just kept it clean.

Too bad these comics feel they have to interject something racy or controversial to make it.
.
.
He repeats the jokes somewhat so I am just giving my critique on this one.
an excerpt about "cake".
time spent well .
funny .
Overall these were good .
I just down rated it because of the cursing and Christian jokes that were in there.

I only saw these as I heard him on XM Sirius .
.
Watched Beyond the Pale and King Baby along with this one all in one night.

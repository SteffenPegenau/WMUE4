this i90 phone is far more difflicult to navigate.
i1000 was easy to dial as cell or connect with two way.
The voice dialing is a feature that just is not used by me because it does not perform as well as some Qualcomm phones I have owned.
The good news!
The bad.
This is like windows me, a fancy upgrade with little valuable tools save for the date book.
Wait until they come out with an updated phone.
I would stay with cheap cell service unless you absolutely need the two way direct.
It is not as easy to navigate as the old i1000.
Service is expensive.
You can set appointments and the i90 will alarm you when you want to be alarmed.
Illuminated display is good.
to get to desired locations.
It is getting smaller by Nextel standards but still is heavy.
The date book feature eliminated the use of my PDA.
You have to push buttons, flip open the cover etc.

Lots of instrumental [stuff] and disjointed noise.
Ho-hum other than that.
I hear nothing new here.
Fab!
(sidenote) A Perfect Circle: Brilliant side project of Maynard IMO.
The case design is innovative, but that is not always a good thing (anyone remember Pearl Jam's vs.
Undertow: More refined, the band gets their legs.
case?).
Lateralus: WTF happened?
Salival: Cool No Quarter re-make, KILLER DVD!
Five years to record an album breeds laziness and complacency.
Aenima: Brilliant!!!
Opiate: Raw, jagged, fresh.
!
I'm sure it will grow on me with more listening, but this is a step backwards IMO.

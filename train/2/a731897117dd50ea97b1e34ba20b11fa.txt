She was a new voice for a new generation, she's so Anti-Britney, which made everyone love her.
And then there's the thing about how she always wears ties and dresses like a guy.
And the same with Sk8er Boi.
Would it kill her to not wear a tie?
I mean seriously.
Ok, at first, I really liked her.
I mean, I'm just so sick of her.
Like Kay Hanley or Nina Gordon.
I think Avril needs a break.
It's like how Alicia Keys always wore her hair in braids, it gets old, and drives me crazy, but I actually like Alicia Keys.
But, who am I to say anything
She should back off and let other people who talent sing.
There are talented people out there who are hardly ever heard.
What is she, a hermaphrodite?
But after a while, things get old.
About 4 or 5 times a day I hear this on the radio "Uh huh....life's like this...uh huh uh huh that's the way it is" Do you know how annoying that is?

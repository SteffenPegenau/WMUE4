Last Flight of the Osiris is another Final Fantasy.
The 'Anime influence' is terrible... almost Samuri Jackish.
Yeah... but it's missused: perhaps even abused here.
You'll realize this after 2, and turn it off.
The writers took all the anime cliches and threw them together to make their story.
What is the Animatrix?
If you liked that movie, you'll probably love this DVD.
Some of stories don't even fit in with the world already created in the first two movies.
However, the vast majority of humanity did not.
If you want to understand it, go see it again.
Creativity?
The Animatrix is a terrible mix of cliches of many genres.Don't believe anyone that tells you this is necessary to understand The Matrix: Reloaded.
The good part?
As for the Animatrix, unless you know you prefer animation over soul, or you are the type of guy that gets off on animated-half-nudity, take the blue pill.
Nine very short and uninspiring animated shorts.

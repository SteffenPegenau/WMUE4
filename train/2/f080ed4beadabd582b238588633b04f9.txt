I ordered this after reading many good reviews on the product.
I guess you really do get what you pay for.I gave this toy 2 stars because the removable piece does entertain my son somewhat.
It's flimsy and wobbly.
I'm sick of all the crappy plastic.
I don't recommend it unless you are on a severe budget.
It's just another junky plastic kids toy.
Invest in something better.
However, when I received it I was really disappointed.
In fact I've decided to do away with all these junky plastic made in china toys and start buying less toys, but better quality toys (old school wooden ones).
I have since ordered the Haba wagon walker.
Not only does it look cheap, but it is cheap!
Cheaply made.
It's made of wood and seems much more sturdy.
My 8 month old tries to pull up on it to stand and it topples over on him.
It's not sturdy at all.

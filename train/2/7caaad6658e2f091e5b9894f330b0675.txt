everytime she moved, either the song would start all over again, or another song would start.
we both very excired because she loves to dance to the wiggles.
the spots where they have to step to make a song go are very close together due to the mat being so small.
even the sound was too loud for her.
plus she couldn't stand on the mat to dance without changing the song.
if your child doesn't mind dancing NEXT to it, then it's great, but loud.
the colors on the mat are great and bright.
she couldn't dance ON the mat.
everything about it was very disappointing.
i will still buy wiggles products, just not this one.
it was very hard to use.
i ended up returning it because it was too frustrating for my dd to the point where she no longer wanted it (she's 20 months).
my dd got this for xmas.
i would say that is very durable, but it's not worth keeping just for that.
the sound is a tad bit loud, could use a volume switch.

From start to finish.
You really have to turn your brain off while watching this movie.
Or be under the influence of something.
He wasn't cute.
He was obnoxious.
I liked that part.
Horrible little boy learns about just how horrible he has been and goes home to eat cake.
Some may think this is a deep, emotional, thought provoking movie but they're wrong.
If you know someone with a horribly obnoxious child, ask yourself, would you want to watch a movie about them?I give it 2 stars because of the good special effects and decent but dull acting of the monsters.
I hated him.
I liked seeing him cry.
Also, when the mom threw her son on the floor after he bit her.
Ok, I get the moral of the story.
He wasn't funny.
I just wish the main character, the boy, was at all likable.

I keep thinking this has got to be a joke.
How could this happen?
It's like Lars forgot to turn on the snare on his snare drum.
Pretty annoying but I can make it through one track .
And what the [heck] it's the same on the next track and the next one.
Speed Metallica just like the old days!
Then all of a sudden I hear this ringing, pinging dinging sound.
But now it's in my head and it's really bothering me and I can't ignore it.
First song pretty good, OK, I think we've got a winner here.
I popped this baby into the car stereo and cranked it.
Someone let me in on the joke!
Stop that ringing!
Maybe Bob Rock got so into ghost playing his bass parts that he forgot to pay any attention to producing.
That snare is part of what keeps this band tight!
What is that?
The rest of the band is right on but the drum keeps ringing past the cut-offs.I am so bummed.

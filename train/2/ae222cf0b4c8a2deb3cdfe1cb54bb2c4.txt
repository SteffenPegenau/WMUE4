Maybe Clancy has tired of writing exciting novels.
In this one, his age shows badly.
He's a character that has lost his shine.
Clancy should have saved his opinions on this issue for a letter to the editor.
In the story, Ryan has reluctantly run for and been elected to the presidency.
If you're new to Clancy, read his earlier novels, like Red October.
They're much, much better stories.
A friend recommended that I read this novel because of the recent diplomatic problems with China and the American spy plane.
I just couldn't.
Instead, he should have written a compelling story.
The book pales in comparison to the real drama.Jack Ryan has been a great character in the previous novels.
Skip this one.
He doesn't really like his job.
I certainly tired of reading The Bear and the Dragon.
By the end, I wish he had just resigned.
Clancy uses abortion in a very inflamatory way to paint the Chinese as horrible people.

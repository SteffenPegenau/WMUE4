Loathed.
I was looking forward to playing this, but I hated it.
Usually, despite any form of annoyance or stupidity, I play the game till the end.
But not this time.
It's annoying - and I never got used to it.
I got so frustrated with it that I took it out of my PS3 and threw it on the ground and let it lay there for a few hours.
Well...
So...
The stupid throwing of the disk to hit the gong thing is so frustrating, I don't care who says it just takes a while to get used to.
I'll watch the ending on youtube.
I think I'm on the last level anyway- I hear there's only 6?
Short (but at the same time way too long).
Hated.
So... eh... it's a double negative from me.
But, I just started Uncharted: Drake's Fortune which completely blows Heavenly Sword out of the atmosphere, hands down.
There's no meat to the game, it's just this weak storyline with freakishly sadistic characters -- all of whom I could care less about.
I'm sure it won't blow me away.On the upside, the graphics are pretty.

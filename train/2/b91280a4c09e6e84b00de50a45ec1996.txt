And the ear fatigue is TERRIBLE!!
But, I'm returning mine.
They still don't feel good, even for short term listening.
My ears STILL hurt.
I hated these as soon as I put them on.
These things fly right off.
No idea how these things got more than 3 stars...
Really horribly uncomfortable.
They're completely flat -- big flat panels pressed against your ears.
Look at the profile of the ear pieces.
I guess people just use them sitting down for short periods of time.
Try making dinner with these on -- you know, bending down to get pots and pans out of the lower cupboards and such...
WAY too uncomfortable.
(Otherwise they're fine... the radio works well and they charge and everything.)
They don't fit well and don't stay in place.

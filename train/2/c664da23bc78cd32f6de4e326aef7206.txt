The charcter, Sophie, was just too good to be true.
The storyline, however, was lacking substance.
I found it to be very slow and boring.
There is one positve thing that I will say.
It was all very predictable.
However, if you are looking for a book that has little character development and a predictable feel good storyline, then you will love this one.
She did not seem real to me at all.
It went from one thing to another, without any time to develop the plot or characters.
There was absolutely no excitement.
Long before the book ended, I already knew what the ending would be.
I felt that there was no depth to any of the characters and I never really felt any attachment to any of them.
I really don't think that I will be buying any other Lori Wick titles.
I almost didn't finish the book, but I did.
This was a very disappointing read for me.
This was my first Lori Wick book.
I also felt that the story was rushed.
Sopie has a very strong faith in God that I did admire.

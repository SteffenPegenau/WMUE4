This... is a LONG POEM!
And a rewrite probably wouldn't hurt.
Of course not.
(I'm serious about this, I can't get enough of them.)
"The people began to walk around and find things to eat/ For now they could see."
And while reading about Coyote and his propensity for flinging vulture feathers about is right up my alley, a good bit of remarketing is needed here.
Pass the salt, please.
But was it marketed that way?
Sure, the pacing is pedestrian and the language is unexceptional, but we need more retellings of various cultures' creation myths to draw on.
Uh, sorry, no.
Had it been marketed as a retelling of a Native American creation myth, hand-bound and illustrated and in general a gorgeous piece of the chapbook-maker's craft, I'd probably have liked it despite my general dislike of Kyger.
Uh, yeah.
It's not a poem, and in all honesty it's not all that long, either; I got through it in about half an hour.
Bad marketing.
Why do I despise this book?

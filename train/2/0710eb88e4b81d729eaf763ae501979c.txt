The southern accent from the American is REALLY bad too!
And then there's the ending.
What's up what that?
So why should I care if he turns back into a human or not?
I consider all of Miyazaki's films to be masterpieces except this one.
That sucks!
In all of Miyazaki's other films you really feel drawn to the main character and want to see them succeed.
It wraps up with a voice over telling what happens next.
The animation is brilliant like in all of Miyazaki's films but I had trouble with the main character, Porco.
He shows so little emotion.
It's like the movie just ends halfway through the story.
First of all, the movie is set in Italy and nobody speaks with an Italian accent.
He has this curse that turned him into a pig but he doesn't even seem to care.
It doesn't resolve anything.
But Porco is so...bleh.
It's really hard to like him at all.
I was very disappointed with this film.

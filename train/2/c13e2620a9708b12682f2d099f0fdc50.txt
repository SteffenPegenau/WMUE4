Get the RTZ album.
The first song is good but sounds just like Amanda.
If you want somthing that sounds like bostom.
I bought it out of loyalty without hearing a song on it.
I am a huge fan of Boston's first 2 albums.
It's too bad but the real Boston with all the original members will probably never happen again.
The rest of the album is a waste of space I'm sorry to say.
I can't beleive it took what 7, 8 years to put this out.
I won't be buying or even thinking about buying Corporate America.
You won't be dissapointed.
This song alone earns the 2 stars I gave this album.
I really tried to like it.
Bottom line is this CD will be collecting alot of dust.
I really gave this album every chance.
I saw this album at the record store and was very excited.

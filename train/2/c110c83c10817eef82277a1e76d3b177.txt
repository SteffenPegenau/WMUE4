It's just a movie.
And they don't even know why they're fighting!
We hear that from everyone quite enough.
My brother has this movie, and at first I liked it.
The movie's trying to get you to spend your money on some movie.
But soon after, I got sick of it.
You're bound to see it some other time.
Some kids are so desperate they STEAL Pokemon cards.
I mean, it's like any other movie: Something or someone trying to have world domination just because some Pokemon thinks that the human race is evil.
Besides, Pokemon are a bad influence on kids.
And they're trying to teach kids a "valuable" lesson, don't fight.
The only thing I like about it is Mew, but the Pokemon don't even use their powers when their fighting like they do in Pokemon battles.
And if you don't, don't spend your money on some dumb movie.
It's like being racist.
Puh-lease!

It takes forever!
Now, you have to clean it.
It tasted pretty good.
Instead we opened the lid and just scooped it out.
You have to take it back apart and clean it piece by piece.
I DO NOT RECOMEND this item.
I pulled the thing so the slurpee would come out.
It took us about 45 minutes just to get the thing together.
Once it started getting thick enough, the motor almost stopped because it was just starting to get thick.
I got this at Christmas and was exited at first.
We put some coke into the thing and we turned it on.
Then, you have to fill the metal thing with ice, salt ,and warm water.
it took a little bit for the coke to start turning into a slurpee.
Finally it was ready.
Hardley anything came out.

A few hours of a video game that I don't even get to control.Really, that's it.
There was nothing cohesive about it.
!
and the man is a freakin' genius.
I read a lot of his stuff (Powers, Ultimate Spider-Man, Daredevil, etc.)
How much money did they spend, and for what?
but you never get the controls.Well, Spider-Man 2 is hitting theaters in a few months and THAT will ROCK!
It just never gelled.
So just how much involvement did Brian Michael Bendis have in this less than stellar effort?
Could not have been much.
.
Watching this show is like watching someone ELSE play a video game, itching for your chance to grab the controls .
This show is NOT genius.
.
The characters are SOOOOO flat.This had so much potential, and it all deflated.
Some good action sequences, but that's about it.

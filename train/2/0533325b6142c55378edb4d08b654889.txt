My setup - LG LW5300 47" .
Heed the negative reviews warnings.

Again, maybe it's better with active shutter TV, but with LG passive 3D, the images just do not pop and tend to Ghost.

HDMI 1.4b cables sitting 7.5 feet away.
I got headaches from the ghosting that occurred throughout the movie.
But this film is terrible in 3D.
This will sadly be my last IMAX Bluray to try.
I wanted to like this, I wanted the reviews it received to be accurate and to the point.
There are some ok moments, but not enough to justify a purchase.

Sony Playstation 3 .
Life and Planet Earth Blu-ray look much much better unconverted from 2D to 3D.

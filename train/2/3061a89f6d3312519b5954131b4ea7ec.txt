Save your money, unless, you want a moon, on a nail, with a remote that turns on and last for 1 hr.
I WOULD NOT BUY THIS AGAIN, ohh, Maybe if it was 5.00, it would then be worth it.
They sent me a email telling they cared and would get right on this, LIES.
Looks just like a fake moon and neat, however, I am sure we could make the same thing for this price.
Only stays on for a hour and will NOT stay on like a night light.
Good luck!
I have heard nothing else from them.
I emailed them, to no avail.
I gave this 2 stars for fun cause it has a remote and that made my 4yr old happy.
We got this in with nothing but the product.
Uncle Milton does not have a easy number for you to call.
it is all automated so...
This product is a joke and a rip off.
No interactive CD and not a single instruction.
SCAM, product and lies, purchase.

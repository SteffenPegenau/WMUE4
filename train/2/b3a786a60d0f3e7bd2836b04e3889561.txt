that was very good!
oh, and jjl looks awful in this pic!
james was famous for his 'realism' and 'psychological depth', qualities that he criticized an older dickens for lacking.
the film is based on a henry james book and it shows.
god, she looks every bit in her 40's.
yeah, the story is 'realistic', but it's boring.
i thought ben chaplin was making love to his mother.
yeah, the characters are 'real'.
ugh.i'm not surprised none of james' books were named in that list of '100 greatest books of all time'.
but they're dull.
but this movie shows what james himself lacked that dickens had in spades: ability to tell interesting stories.
if nothing else, a film should make you want to read the book.
the rest of the film i can leave.
after watching this, i'm not exactly running to my local library to get a copy.
this is a pretty dull story about jilted love.
the best thing about this film is the camera work, especially the long establishing shot.

Needless to say, my feet still get cold when wearing these.
I'd rather not need to buy thermal lined boots to keep my feet warm in the winter.
They stretch out immediately and from day one they have been too loose.
Here's what's wrong with them:1.
I find they get bunched up because of the extra material floating around in my shoe and they fall down my calf.
This is the part that needs to be thick!
My feet get cold easily and I've been trying to find some good warm socks.
I had hoped these socks would do the trick.2.
I need coverage for my foot!
The leg portion is very thick, but that's why I have thermals and pants.
The socks were supposed to be good for size 9-12 (The large).
So when I see a sock called "40 Below" I assume they are going to be warm.
I have size 12 feet.
These socks were a disappointment for me.
They are normal sized feet.
The part of the sock that covers your foot is actually not that thick.

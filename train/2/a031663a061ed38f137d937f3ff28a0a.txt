I like 'I Me Mine' some, the Harrison track.
I'm shaking!
'The Long And Winding Road' is basically a lounge song (pretty, at best) overrun by Phil Spector's grandiose symphonics.
Give me Neil Diamond!
Thank God!
He got out!?!
Sorry Beatle fans, I have to let it be...
Oh!
But aren't his vocals always very nasal?
'Band On The Run' is so superior to anything here...
This collection by the Not-So-Fab Foursome is O.K., O.K.!?!
Am I the most hated man on Amazon?
Isn't eveyone tired of all this!?!
Ooooh!
'Across The Universe' is more Lennon being a cosmic William Blake!
Should a melodist like McCartney be in this band?...

I have a medium sized head and while there is adjustment for length there no adjustment head size.
It is made for small heads.I am wearing it now and after 10 min I feel like I have a vice on my head.
These weren't cheap either.
My old (ten years) Sennheisers have a dual band which curves to the top of the head.
The head band only touches your head in one spot on top.
There are two small tabs which hold the ear piece on.
The headband is a solid cheap flat preformed piece of plastic.
Not as good as Bluetooth.They are not rechargable.
Let me explain.
The battery compartment is accessed by removing the ear piece.
I can't see these tabs lasting very long.Whoops, just had an eyeball pop out.
Man these are tight.
Very uncomfortable.
Boo Sennheiser!Sound is as expected - OK for RF.
It is not even curved to fit a head.

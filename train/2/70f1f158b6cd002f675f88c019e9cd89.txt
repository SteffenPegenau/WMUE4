Also when my hair dries it's a little lighter where the Dermatch got onto my hair providing a slight difference in color from the covered area and non covered area.
Couvre provides such a wedge.
The paste Couvre does not do that.
The Couvre lasts me maybe 2 months but is much cheaper also.
I'll stick with my old standby.
I used Couvre for years which is a paste in a tube.
You wet the applicator and rub it on the disc.
I really don't care for that feature.
The small applicator makes it difficult to get good coverage.
No more Dermatch for me.
I found if you use foam wedges that you can get at any makeup counter they provide better coverage.
In my opinion it's not worth the price for the coverage it provides.
I'll use the Dermatch in a pinch when I'm out of my other product but won't spend the 40 plus dollars on it ever again.
I wanted to try Dermatch because of some of the good reviews and the fact it should last 6 months or more.
Dermatch is a dry disc.

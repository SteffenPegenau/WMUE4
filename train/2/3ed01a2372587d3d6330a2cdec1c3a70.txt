I've been to two of Josh Groban's concerts during this tour and have loved both of them.
I have to admit that I was at a loss as to why Reprise would release this one.
It isn't during this particular performance.
I have everything he's done, and multiples of them too.
Is singing is rarely like this.
His voice is lovely and usually perfection.
If you love Josh Groban, perhaps it would be best to wait until his next studio release.
To sae part is that Josh is a hardworking singer.
I've noticed low reviews here and on Barnes & Noble.
I was too.
I can understand why so many people were disappointed.
This is not.
I watched this one on PBS but didn't buy the DVD because it is NOT a worthy release for Josh.
So there are many other sites and people from all walks of life who either bought it or saw it on PBS, and didn't care for it.
His concerts are terrific in person.

I hope the both of us can keep up with changes that Autodesk will introduce in the future.
The excitement was short lived.
This book is a reference for R12-14.
Overall, I Think Mr. Decuir has good start for a book.
I was excited to see an AutoCAD book specificaly for theatre.
The command buttons and dialog windows are different from R2000i.
I am using AutoCAD 2000i.
The book comes with a useful CD-Rom of sample files and an instrument library.
There is no reference to theatre drafting until the later chapters.
A rethink of the exercise headings is needed, from Excerise 1- Printing a file to EX #1- Drawing a flat.
It would be great if the book had screen shots of the drafting exercises, so you can reference to what you are drawing.
Unfortunately I found the book out of date.
Students need to relate the use of CAD to theatre drafting early on.
The emphasis is on learning specific commands.
The tutorials used are similar to other CAD books.

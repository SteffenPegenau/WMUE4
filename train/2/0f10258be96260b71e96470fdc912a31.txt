Salty and bottomost ones were stale.
If you want to call some VERY hard, rocky "version" of honey roasted peanuts as "mixed nuts" from the picture, then it's time to close the shop down.
Section 2 were the cashews.
Horrible.
Did I get that?
They were great, no problems.
I got the pistachios(the white looking nuts in corner).
Stale with a slight sweet taste and bottom ones were like somebody poured sugar all over it when it was wet.
Section 3 were SUPPOSED to be salted almondsd from the picture.
And Section 4.
See what's in that picture, the one that looks like mixed nuts brittle?
First of all, I didnt get what's pictured.
1 bad product tried is another business that could've done better.......
Did business with Ole J&D's, but will NEVER buy this again.
I got sugar(aka honey) roasted peanuts.
My impression is that they wont "randomize" what you're supposed to get.
NOPE.

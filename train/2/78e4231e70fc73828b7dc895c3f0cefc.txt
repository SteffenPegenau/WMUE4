This year you have to pay for the state and then ask them for the money back.
Just download it.
Was totally unable to register TurboTax.
I'd rather do the taxes manually than deal with this stuff.
The first state was free with TurboTax.
Last year was easy with respect to the state program.
Every time I tried to register the product it kept telling me the server was down.
Also, the tree structure is different from last year so I had to tailor my backup process to find this year's files.
It takes long enough to do my taxes now, I shouldn't have to waste time saying 'no' to an array of additional Intuit product offerings.
I hated the 'tacky' advertisements placed throughout the product.
Not this year.
TurboTax couldn't find last year's return so I had to find it manually.
I finally gave up.
I have used TurboTax for many years and have been happy with the product.
Next year it's Tax Cut for me.

It took over a month to receive them.The bottom line.
Subsequent e-mail exchanges took 2-4 days for Cymax to respond.
There were also no instructions.
My e-mail was answered in two days.
Opening the box we found the shelves broken.
Once assembled it looks great and is a wonderful addition to the kitchen.
After 3 weeks I decided to repair the broken pieces myself and assemble the cart.
I ordered this cart directly from Cymax.
It takes two people to assemble.
It arrived quickly.
The cart looks good, is solid, and functional.
The e-mail customer service is slow but effective.
I did receive replacement shelves shipped from Thailand.
I called the 1-800 customer service several times staying on hold 15+ minutes each time.
The telephone customer service does not answer in a reasonable time.
Like others have reported, my cart arrived without assembly instructions and with damaged parts.
I gave up that approach in frustration and sent an e-mail.

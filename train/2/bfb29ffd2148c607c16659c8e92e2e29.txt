But I am totally disappointed by ony after using it for about a month.
Following are main drawbacks:1.
The battery life is just about 1.5 hours.5.
The Windows Vista Business, pre-installed on the laptop crashes often.
Amazon delivered it on time.
It takes about 40 minutes of waiting to reach a level 2 support
The cooling fan is very noisy.
I have owned other laptops with practicaly no noise.7.
The customer support is poor.
I would say it is an unstable operating system.4.
It is very slow though it boasts a Dual Core 2 Intel processor T7200.
The laptop becomes hot very quickly and you can not keep it in your lap for long.2.
I think it is due to lots of pre-installed programs on trial basis (for 60 days)3.
The built-in-camera picture quality is poor.6.
The specifications for Sony VGN-SZ430 N/B appeared great on paper / online.
I bought this Sony Notebook on Amazon.com after lot of online study of different makes and models.

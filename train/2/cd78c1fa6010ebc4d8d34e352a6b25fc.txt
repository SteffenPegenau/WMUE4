So I'm writing this review for people who simply want to know whether to BUY this album, or NOT.
I'm really into music; play guitar, drums etc.
(float on, and Ocean Breathes Salty) The rest are "average".
It's hard to review music, but I would say that it is somewhat worth buying.
It's definitely different.
But half of the album is decent.
Well, I can tell you that it's not really worth buying if you're not into this type of music.
There are only two main songs on the album.
I'm also very open minded to music.
In otherwords, if the album is worth buying.
If you like their main song, don't expect the rest to sound the same.
They're sound is unique, and lyrics stand out a lot.
Mostly depending on your background with this band, or other music.
Some songs are just not worth listening to.
While others you can bare.
So buy this album if you like, I don't regrett it...It takes awhile getting used to, but it's modest.

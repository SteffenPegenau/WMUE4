Fine.
When I sent them back, their form for returns included a choice for exchange and the reason.
I have worn this model for years.
I ordered a size 6.5 and they sent an 11.5.
I heard nothing for quite a while.Finally I got an email saying that I had been given a refund.
I wrote them back asking about that.
And if they are all on ebay, how come you can get them on Amazon?Anyway, I did finally find my shoes and they will arrive soon - from another seller.
Please get them.But not from this seller.
Two months it took from my first order and I really will not work with this company again.
I love these shoes.
Okay.
Okay.
I told them on this form that the size was wrong.
They said they cannot do exchanges since all their stock is on ebay.
But why didn't they say that in their description that they don't do exchanges?
Well that was nice but I wanted an exchange.

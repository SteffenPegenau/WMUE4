Why some singers/producers won't believe that we can recognize talent without vocal gymnastics is a mystery.
and if you want a worthwhile pop/jazz C.D., purchase Joni Mitchells "Both Sides Now".
No.
Maybe I'll see her again in 10 years and be blown away.
Completely marketable.
Saw her live, and it was all about being bequilling and sexual (thought she was singing Cole Porter's "Love For Sale" every song but with different lyrics and melodies).
Yes, a fabulous instrument (voice).
Cause she sold alot of units.
oops, not marketable).
Far too syrupy, lacking depth and maturity.
However, right now, it's all marketing and hoopla.
Pretty package.
Could I listen to the whole thing straight through?
Die hard jazz fans will not appreciate this C.D.
Over-sings the endings of every tune.
How about Nancy King?
Indicative of the "pop"-ing of Jazz (will probably get nominated for and win a Grammy, but why?

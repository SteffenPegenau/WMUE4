Used it that way for awhile until the same thing happened.
It's exactly what I need but they are truly a piece of junk!
The bottom also broke out of the second one...luckily I was able to use the wood in the bottom again.
The second one I had to wire together after the plastic broke.
I just hope I can find something the same size.
They have Cheap plastic and are not sturdy.
Well...
I had my father in law make me a piece of wood to fit in the bottom.
Don't waste your money on this cart.
After only a week, pieces of plastic broke on the sides causing the bottom to fall out.
Worked well for awhile until the whole front piece of plastic broke off.
I needed it so I bought another one.
I've have gone through two of these quick carts and both have broken.
This cart was used to haul my jewelry cases around.
I will not buy another again.

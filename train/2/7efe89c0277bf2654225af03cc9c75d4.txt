Load completely left me out in the cold.
Turns out I was right.
I've been a Metallica fan since Kill'em All.
Reload wasn't much better.
What utter garbage.
I borrowed it from a friend first.
I personally thought Fuel was decent but I think "Where the Wild Things are" is the best track on the entire album (strictly my opinion).
I think I'll wait until they get their collective act together before I buy any new original material from them.
I wasn't going to waste money on something that could be a major disappointment.
Fortunately, I haven't bought this album or Load.
It's just a heavy version of Load, nothing more.
Overall, the album is a dud from beginning to end, showing little of the musical finesse and power that is evident in their previous works.
They have put out some of the most memorable metal of the 80's through 1991.
How could they do it?!
What a shame.
I couldn't believe my ears when I heard it.
To be honest, some of the songs were okay.

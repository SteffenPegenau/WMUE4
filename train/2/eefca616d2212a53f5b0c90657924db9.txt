I am very impressed by the fact that Andy keeps his brother Mason's memory alive at all times.
One set for the house and one for the car.
THAT, is the most wonderful thing of all!!
I have all three of Andy Griggs albums, but let this guy loose!!!
The other tracks drone on.
I, a male fan of Andy Griggs, feel that his songs need more pizzazz!!
He'll crack the charts.
Keith's music is addictive to both gals and guys.
I have every one of Keith Urban's albums and actuallydoubles of them.
Andy, on the other hand, has great talent, but there is nothing particularly exciting about THIS I GOTTA SEE.
But, as admirable as that is, the industry won't care.
I think tracks 7,9 , and 10 are good.
They care about NUMBERS!
But, what rhythm and beat.
Right now his work seems more than somewhat restrained.
Keith's work is just as sensuous as Andys when he wants it to be.

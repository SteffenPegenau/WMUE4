Relatively ineffective.
It leaks when you fill it, it leaks when you walk to the fridge with it.
This leaves a small puddle on the floor that you will later A. step in, or B. catch your baby splashing in.
Even if you are really, really careful.
Not *totally* ineffective...it would keep flies out, but only if they didn't bump it, or look at it funny.
A lot.
That'd be another negative.I think we're just going to buy a new fridge with a built-in water filter.
It holds water and fits in my fridge.
Those are the positives.Negatives--IT LEAKS.
Otherwise, just carrying the pitcher can cause water to slosh out past the lid.I've recently discovered the black silt at the bottom.
So thanks, Brita...you sucked so bad you convinced my cheapo husband to buy me a new fridge.
It leaks when you pourrr.
It doesn't 'click' on in any way...it just sits on top.
Nobody likes stepping in cold water with socks on.The lid just pops off, willy nilly.

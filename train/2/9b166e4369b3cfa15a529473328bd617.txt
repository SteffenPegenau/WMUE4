This book left me depressed and discouraged, but most of all puzzled.
What made him so special?
And, the Holy Man, himself, had so many weaknesses...why would anyone go to him?
After all the great reviews and a recommendation from a friend I read The Holy Man with a "huh?"
Sorry, but I wasn't enthralled and captivated.
And, if all the answers are in ourselves, then why do we need God?
And, what of the Savior and the Atonement?
What the heck did the thing about the ponies mean?
Okay, so it gave some examples of human nature, but I thought they were things everyone already knew.
Maybe I am simple minded, but I just plain didn't get it.
Symbolism?
It caused me to wonder what is wrong with me that I didn't get it and become enlightened.
after every chapter.
Why not just say it right out?
I gave it 2 stars because some of the "pilgrims" were interesting.

Also Garmin has no customer support.
Item was rushed to market without working out the bugs.
I sent an email to Garmin and never received a response.
I uploaded the new software as recommended and now the unit can not acquire a satellite signal.
NEW ONE WORKS AS ADVERTISED.
I received this for a Christmas gift and was thrilled with the concept.
Right out of the box I encountered several problems with the unit.
After doing a little research on the web I discovered this is a common problem with this device.
I then tried to contact Garmin's customer support and have been waiting to talk with someone for over an hour.Bottom line: Don't waste your money.
STILL NOT IMPRESSED WITH GARMIN CUSTOMER SUPPORT.Don't waste your precious time and money on this unit.
RETURNED UNIT.
NOT SURE IF REPLACEMENT UNIT WAS BRAND NEW OR REFURBISHED.
It would continuously hard reset itself.
UNIT CAME PRE-LOADED WITH NEW SOFTWARE.
Finally a device that integrated both GPS and Palm applications.

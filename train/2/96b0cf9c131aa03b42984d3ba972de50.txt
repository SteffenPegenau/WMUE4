Watching Snipes blindly fire hundreds of rounds from a suppressed weapon, simply looked stupid.But, I guess aging action stars have to make a living too.
Just makes too many less than decent movies.
Rent it if you like Wesley Snipes movies.
This direct to DVD movie is about as B as B-movies gets.
Why can't they admit they are greedy, and don't have a soul?
He's still a decent actor.
Very cliche.Gun battles in this movie are lame.
Wesley Snipes seems to be following the same career path as Steven Seagal.
How many movies have we seen where corrupt people claim they are "owed" and that is why they have sold out.
I won't give away the plot, which is very cliche.
Oh well.
And of course Snipes needs to get caught up on those taxes, so it may have simply been a case of desperate times calling for desperate measures.
Would not recommend buying the movie.
Like I said.
Why always blame whoever it is they work for?

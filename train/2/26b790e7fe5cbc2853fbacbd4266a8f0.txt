Logging into the web brower setup was pointless, when you try to save settings the web browser either rejects the devices redirect page or gives you some authentication error.
I have mac address filtering and no key set on my network and even when I turn the filter off and the firewalls; it doesn't want to be found on the network.
I'm sure any of them would be better then this joke.
There are alternative to this device.
Nothing.
Seriously -- Not a good linksys product.
I had it working wirelessly, wired to a wrt54g, and wired directly to the computer.
--router is on 192.168.1.210.
Avoid this product and save yourself headaches and disappointment.
Great product when it works, which is almost never.
Everytime it was working it was great.
Made sure I was on the same network as the bridge(ie 192.168.1.?)
No firmware available.
Out of the box, the Setup CD did not detect my bridge;rendering it useless.
No dropped sound, very few instances of lag issues.

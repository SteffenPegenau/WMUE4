Otherwise, thumbs down.
These speakers can not handle volume above low.
It should also be noted that there is a fixed wire coming out of one speaker that connects to the other speaker.
I then played a B.B.
The bass was completely distorted.
I started using them by playing a Mozart piano concerto.
2 stars instead of one because they don't freak out at low volume.
Don't even try playing anything loud.
I tried moving the speakers and adjusting eq in itunes to no avail.
I'm very disappointed with these speakers.
The piano sounded washed out.
This wire is quite short which I found restrictive.
Apple pushes these so I expected more.
King cd, again at medium volume.
I set the volume at mid level.
Whenever the whole orchestra played a chord the sound distorted badly.

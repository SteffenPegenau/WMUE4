Otherwise the unit runs well and has an easy set up.
After reading all the reviews, and owning a slowly dying Kenwood receiver.
There was no comparison between my old Kendwood and the Sherwood.
So my search still continues.
BASS lovers will hate this unit, so be warned.
There is no window shaking with this unit.
The price is right, but I really enjoy a decent bass background.
But I stress.... the Bass really is weak.
The biggest downfall fo the sherwood was its inability to play a decent bass.
I immediately was refunded no questions asked ( you gotta love Amazon ).
So I sent it back.
But I did not lose any money.
I played CD's and tried the tuner.
I replaced my kenwood with the new Sherwood, and immediately realized what quality sound was.
I took a chance and purchased the sherwood rx4109.
No matter what you did the bass was weak and lacking.
Oh well I guess I made my point.

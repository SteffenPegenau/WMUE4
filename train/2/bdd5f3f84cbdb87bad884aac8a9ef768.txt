Gosh, we're real embarrassed and sorry about all of this.
How many minutes of this film had Julianne Moore in it?
What's wrong with you people?
The ending is also pathetic.
Oh, it's ok Harrison.
It started out alright with the murder scene and Mr Ford looking like some kind of a wooly mammoth, which was amusing, and then went downhill fast.
This movie was boring.
Harrison, I weep for the good old days.
But my viewing partner agreed with me that this one was a big fat let down.
That's what they all say, Harrison.
Come on, give me a break.
Do yourself a favor and pass this one up.
Uh huh.
I never once held my breath or even felt sorry for the good doctor.
So what is her name doing on the opening credits?
I don't know, maybe I'm just hard to please.
Forgive and forget?
Five?

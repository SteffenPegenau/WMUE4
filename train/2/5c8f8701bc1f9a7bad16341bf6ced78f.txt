The concept of "Anyone Else" is lame.
"Love," "10 Commandments Of Bart," and "I Can't Help Myself" are moldy rap tunes.
"Every Summer With You" is cheesy, and "Kamp Krusty" didn't need to be made into a long suite.
I decided to give this album a try.
George Clinton's song "She's Comin' Out Swingin" goes on WAY too long.
They don't redeem the album, however.
The only real bright spot on this album is the rock song "Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves."
The material here is over 6 years old, and you can tell.
I've been a Simpsons watcher since 1991.
"Funny How Time Slips Away" is halfway decent, and it was nice to see Apu take over on "24 Hours A Day."
Altogether, this album isn't as good as Simpsons Sing The Blues.
If you didn't watch the Simpsons earlier in the '90s and you were to get this album, you'd be disappointed.
But why did they release it at this time?
This album is best for fans of the older Simpsons style.
I watched the show change over the years.

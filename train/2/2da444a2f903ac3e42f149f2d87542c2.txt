The rest of the band sounded week and loose.
His day is done.
If your not a fan, don't bother.
I use to see BS at many of the small venues in New Jersey in his heyday.
If you're a BS fan, I know you hear it.
Sadly, as a once loyal suppoter of the boss, I acknowledge that he simply doesn't have it anymore.
Almost as if they really didn't care.
What a disappointment.
In 2005, the last two shows at Shea stadium were a total disappointment.
Clarence stood there like a rock and barely played.
The boss was moving around a lot but vocally off key and strained to hit any of the tough notes.
Great shows to be sure.
The E street band has also grown either old or tired or both.
After starting two hours late, he gave the most lackluster performance to date.
Buy the old records and rejoice in what was once a truly unique talent.

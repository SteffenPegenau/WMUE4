And last but not least, it has ugly pictures of them inside!
Like for example,they said that Zac plays with Power Rangers.
NOT TRUE!
Buy, their official book instead!
Everyone already knows his name, fav color, and birthday!
And also, it has all the same info!
When Zac wore that block sweatshirt with an orange-collared shirt underneath.
Sure, maybe when he was little, but I mean, come on!
Also, it talks a little bit too much about his bros.
I mean, the books about him isn't it?
I think this book is a TOTAL waste.
It really needs to get updated.
I read in a chat on their website, that Zac said he DIDN'T play with Power Rangers.
NOT WORTH IT!
I mean, it has so much fiction in it!
Who cares what his favorite color is!
And most of the pix, everyone has seen!
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT!!!
Like when they performed live on the Today Show.

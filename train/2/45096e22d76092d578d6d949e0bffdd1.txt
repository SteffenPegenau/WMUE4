There were too many characters.
It was TOO serious!!
I honestly would put the book down and wonder should I continue.
It started light and humerous.
I know God puts us all through tests but the plot of this book was over the top.
The whole book was one bad situation after the next.
The chapters were VERY long.
I was disappointed with it overall.
The book was written from a single woman in her 20s which I love.
My expectations were not met except for the spiritual.
I purchased this book with the hopes of reading something humerous, light, and spiritual.
This is not the "chick-lit" I expected to read from the excerpt.
The references to how God speaks to us in a quiet voice was nice and the Scropture references were nice as well.
But with every page, it became heavier and heavier.
And the story seem to drag along.

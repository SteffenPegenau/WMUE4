Would I buy another SONY???
It worked fine with very few coasters.
I bought mine over a year ago.
I still have the drive installed and I'm still using it, however I'm now looking for a replacement.
Booting 2-3 times can't be good for the rest of my components, so it's time to make a change.
When it detects OK, the drive still works fine.
Now enter the problem... At 13 months it started causing POST failures during bootup.
(Guess what... the warranty is 12 months!)
For the first 13 months it was a very good drive.
BIOS will only detect about half of the time.
The other half of the time I get "Invalid IDE device" messages.
After much trouble-shooting, swapping IDE controllers, slaves, masters, etc, and contacting SONY tech support, it became very obvious that this drive is my problem.
Maybe... maybe not.
Most often I settled for 4x burning.
I was usually unsuccessful in burning at 8x unless copying a cd.

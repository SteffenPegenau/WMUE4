I ended up fabricating a mount out of aluminum.
The problem is that this does not let the ipod breathe.
As far as I know it is....was watertight.
I had to drill 2 small holes in it to attach a bracket for a ram mount.
No fun riding down the road.
I have the 30gb, I recently replaced the battery as I thought that may have been a problem and I heard there were some that would cause the ipod to overheat.
I then, in several steps, proceeded to drill ventilation holes to allow the ipod to cool off while riding.
Better but still crashing my ipod.
This resulted in several lockups with the ipod.
It looks great and while it works it works good.
In short, if you are thinking of doing this, Don't.
I used o rings and silicone to make it waterproof.
I bought this otterbox to make a water proof ipod mount for my motorcycle.
in the end you will regret it.
What I have now looks like swiss cheese and still does not cool enough to work properly.

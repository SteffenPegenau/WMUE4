Sadly the product wasn't.As soon as the cooker arrived I put it to use.
They were great.
This was very disappointing.I felt the quality of this product was very poor.
I was very excited to find a rice cooker that had a stainless steel interior.
The seller was very accomodating on the return.
About 30 minues later, I smelled burning.
The seller was great.
I consulted a friend of mine who grew up in Japan and uses a rice cooker everyday to make sure I was using this one correctly.
The product stinks.
The rice was burned to the bottom and the cooker never shut off.
It took a few tries to get it to start cooking.
Fresh out of the box I noticed the switch was very loose.
Don't buy this one.
This was the only one I could find.It arrived very quickly and well packaged.
The instructions, as previous reviewer mentioned, were a bit hard to undestand.
This should have been my first clue something wasn't right.

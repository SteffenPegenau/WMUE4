I know you've still got it in you.
I'm a huge fan of the Pixies and Frank's earlier stuff (Frank Black & Teenager of the year-if you don't have these, buy them).

He and the Pixies had such a unique sound.

The band sounded like they were pretty tight but it didn't do anything for me.
I bought two CDs this week.
I hate to say it but Frank's new offering is the bland one.
Get a drinking problem.
Talk to peachy peach about kissy kiss.
You'll find none of that stuff here.

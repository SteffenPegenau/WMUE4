But this book takes the freaking cake.
Look, I like the girl.
Does every adult in this darn series have to be connected?Sadly, guys, it just gets worse from here.
Anyway, as the series progressed I kept noticing continuity errors.
What's up with Mona, too?
Where the HECK does Melanie fit in?
Just saying.
The series NEVER mentioned Mike having a sister.
And Dylan.
I eventually gave up on the series because of the continuity errors.
Really, I do.
But no matter how I wrack my brains I cannot imagine any chance for her to exist.
AFAIK she and Ashleigh never saw each other again after she moved, and how they're best friends?
Heck, most future sister-in-laws are made bridesmaids.
If Mike had a sister, why wasn't she at his and Ashleigh's wedding?
Okay, I've been reading this series ever since I was in elementary school.
I'm nineteen now, by the way.
EVER.Oh, and I hate Christina.
Seriously.

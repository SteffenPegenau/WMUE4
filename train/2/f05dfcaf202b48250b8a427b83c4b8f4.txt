Pictures show her with a pacifier in her mouth, but when I put the pacifier in her mouth it just falls out.
She is a very cute little baby, and I do not plan to return her, but I fear my granddaughter might prefer playing with her with the sound off!
Maybe the doll is defective?
I installed the batteries, and the baby is really a disappointment.
The slightest letup in pressure sends her back to moaning (or crying) again.
She laughs briefly, then launches into a "sighing" that sounds more like a moan.
The baby either moans or cries.
Maybe there is prozac for baby dolls.
Is she dying?
Is she depressed?
Poor baby, does she have a tummy ache?
The pacifier (and bottle) must be pushed into her mouth and held there for her to suck.
Appendicitis?
I just bought this doll for my three year old granddaughter.
It is actually pretty scary.
I have not given it to her yet.
Asthma?
The giggling and cooing is very short in comparison.

Their singing voices definitely need some help, and it just really lacks that special something that ABBA had.
I heard Mamma Mia and liked it, until I heard ABBA's version, which is much better.
A bunch of kids just took other people's songs and sang them (badly).
I'm 18 and I have seen the light!
Also, I read some review that said A*Teens sing better than ABBA.
I just listened to their version of Super Trouper, oh my gosh, it's terrible.
Instead of this ripoff, just buy ABBA's Gold CD.
It's just really boring.
By the way, I'm not some old person that's against new sounds.
There doesn't seem to be anything new or different about this CD.
I really just discovered ABBA and I just don't like that most people my age only know A-Teen's version of Dancing Queen or whatever.
Part of why ABBA was so awesome was that they were this Swedish band that wrote cool songs in English.
The original is just so much better.
Haha.
Um, I don't think so.

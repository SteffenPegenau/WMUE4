I'm talking pre-teen.
I read the previews, poored over the screenshots and hunted for the best buy.
There's not enough meat here for hardcore gamers to sink their teeth into and as for the SW oldtimers, unless your a collector I say wait and see if SW2 for the GBA will be better.
Here's why: The game manual practically reveals everything your going to encounter and the controls are loose.
I was really hyped for this game.
Guess what?
Finally, I plucked down my hard earned money.
I got ripped off.
Slash here, run there, nothing challenging or any chance to explore the SW universe via your GBA.
)That's right, I'm a father, that's why I said not for mature fans.
(I'll admit there pretty cool.
Game play is strictly by the numbers.
My 5 yr old was beside himself.
My mistake?
This game is geared for YOUNG players only.
As for the graphics?
Know if only they had a Darth Vader or Yoda cheat...
Otherwise, this game is perfect for the Anakin aged.

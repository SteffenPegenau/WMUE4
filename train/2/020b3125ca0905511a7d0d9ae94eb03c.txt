Contacted Manufacturer for repair options - after many phone calls was informed that Amazon was not an authorized dealer and that I needed to return it to them.
Informed by Amazon that the item was no longer available though I noticed it on the web site for a $10.00 increase in price!
Very good price with free shipping!
Liked Unit - but - Control unit broke when tried to plug in.

Free shipping was not included when order was totaled.
Returned item to Amazon - Fast, curtious, and prompt but a general hassle for something I had wished to have in service.
I guess that Amazon didn't want to honor the old price.

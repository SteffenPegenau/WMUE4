Good luck.
Guess things work out like that sometimes.
Follow up.
I tried to deal with it but it just glares at me and mocks me every time I look at it on a dark background.
I was told to return for a refund.
I am on my 2nd one of these.
The Pixels show on dark screens and the spots showed on light colors.
Bad pixels and light bleed seems common on these.
I don't know if I should try a third or just try a different brand.
I ordered a 22" Samsung Syncmaster 2253LW from another site which came out to be the same price after rebate.
I return to Amazon and they informed me they would not ship a 2nd replacement as the problem may be more widespread and may need some review.
I did a return and the 2nd one has a bad pixel right in the center of the screen.
The first one had two bad pixels and six gray spots.
Two defective ones in a row.
Kind of glad it happened now as the new monitor is amazing in comparison ... lol.

AMERICAN SPLENDOR !!!
.
I would have to say that I loved the movie more than the soundtrack but have to ask .
.
This is clearly a huge mistake because the artist Eytan Mirsky, (who is actually featured in the movie) is AMAZING !!
.
.
WHERE IS EYTAN?The missing ingredient in the soundtrack for American Splendor is obviously the song .
AMERICAN SPLENDOR !
.
!If you missed him on the soundtrack you can catch him at MAKOR in NYC on 9/16 at 10PM where he will play his song .
.
.
How could a soundtrack for a movie not include the title movie song?

It is now a not so fun and boring arcade game!
Also, you are unable to watch the competition's lap time.
I must admit that the PS2 graphics are stunning but c'mon!
And that, my friends, is a bunch o' BS!
For me to negotiate a sweeper, I have to induce lift throttle oversteer.
Then, EA removes the level of modification allowed on the car.
I will stick to playing the PSX version on my PS2 console!
And when qualifying, you are not able to advance the time.
There is more to a game than just good looks.For one, taking the BMW-Williams, the car does not have the real top speed of the real F1 car.
This game is not a similation.
I cannot believe the reviews of this game!
That is now removed.
I regret buying this game and in the process of trying to sell it!
For one, the PSX version of the game is so much better in terms of game play.
Am I expected to sit infront of the game for an actual hour???
In the PSX version, you can control the amount of steering lock.

I actually don't think it is a scratch mark.
I want to return it.
The silver frame tvs look much better.
Hopefully Amazon would still let me return it, even if that means I need to pay a fee.There are two other things I don't like about this tv.1.
Wish I noticed that difference before my purchase.
It makes the pictures appear to be darker.
But some marks appeared since last week that looked like an airplane right in the middle of the screen.
Everytime when it is a light colored a picture, you can see it -- looks just like an airplane coming over from a distance.
I purched this tv two months ago.
But it's already more than two months.
I think the screen somehow did it by itself.
Nobody scratched it.
The black frame.
I guess I was over influenced by that.2.
The picture quality - not exactly what I expected.
I only have one good daughter who's always very gentle and never went near the tv.
But Toshiba got such a good rating.

Installing a mouse should take more the the time it takes to connect it.
What am I looking for.
You must connect it to a usb port.
And they shouldn't.
You shouldn't have to search the web for help.
Like many other reviewer, I agree the the wheel isnt' as smooth or reactive as it should be.
Anyway, I finally got the thing to work and I hate it.
Good design.My optical mouse 2.0 will connect to the ps2 port with a usb to ps2 adapter.
How long should I press the buttons on the receiver and mouse.
It's on the box at least 6 times.
The instructions don't say that.
The 2000 receive has no light like the 2.0.
Not this one.
Microsoft is very impressed with themselves that they've include 6+ month batteries.
Shop around.
To you and me, that 2 Engergizer AA's.
WOW!.The mouse does work but not as well as 100 others in the same price range.
The instructions don't say much at all.

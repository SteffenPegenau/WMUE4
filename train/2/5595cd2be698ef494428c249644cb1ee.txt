!If u want to hear some great music ..
Nickelback is just an above average band.. i know , many would disagree.. but its true.
The only great point abt Nickelback is...without any doubt .. Chad Kroeger !!
and they will make u forget nickelback (ofcourse not chad )!!
He shud better go solo !!
I have to say tht Nickelback Needs Melody in their music !!
i wonder why ?
hes a fantastic singer with a great range and a captivating voice !!
There r no moving ballads and no excellent acoustic numbers at all in all their albums !
Some of their songs r very good ..but just some !
Nickelback fans plz dont mind... but this is true..they r not making good music despite 3 albums or so !
!
many songs have the same sound !!
Listen to the band REVIS !!
Give a try to REVIS !!

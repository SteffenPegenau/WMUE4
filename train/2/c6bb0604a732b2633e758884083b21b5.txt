I was hand washing them.
I will try and contact the company to see if they'd replace...
Right away the glasses were too light to use in my brewer so I was freaking out.
So I am super dissapointed.
I also have cheap ikea glasses that have lasted years without any cracks so what's the point in paying more ??
When I received them they were so light and I loved the "modern" design.
I actually bought the 8.5 oz or 9.oz one but I know these are all the same
I figured ok dissapointed but no biggie.
I was super duper excited to get these glasses.
I used hot/ cold as it says you could.
One day the glass just cracked on the bottom on it's own as the other reviewer had wrote.
I hope so..
With a sponge.
I had been eyeing them for so long to use in my Keurig mini brewer.
Then I put a plate under the glass to use it.

The only thing that cought my attention was the battles scenes.
When the film started I almost fell asleep in the theater.
This movie is so bad it is not even worth renting it on video.
This movie is like a cartoon compared to Saving Private Ryan.
I just keeped my mouth shut continued watching it.
After seing Saving Private Ryan, I was expecting a film alot like it or even better.
When I went to the theaters to watch this movie.
They said it was a joke.
By the time the movie was over.
It was a big dissapointment, what a disaster for 20th-Century Fox.
I invited my grandma who is a big fan of war movies and I also invited my two cousins.
The plot was very dull and boring.
My folks reaction was even worse than mine!
I was begging for the movie to be over.
Through the whole movie, my cousin wispered to me "This movie S***S!"
I do not recommend this at all!

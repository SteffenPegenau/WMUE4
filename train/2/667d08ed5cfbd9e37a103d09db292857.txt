That said, I found this book a chore.
That's what I was left with.
None of the women portrayed were deeply drawn.
There is more blood and gore in this innocent novel than in any Steven King horror fest.
However, if these topics enthrall you, pick up the book and knock yourself out.
I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies and I don't want to.
Dinah (pronounced "dee nah") herself was not fully formed.
At best, it's deeply superficial.
And finally, I would not want to set foot in a red tent.
I have less than zero interest in the female bodily functions of others.
It is, by far, the bloodiest book I've ever read.
I'm not familiar with the Old Testament, nor am I a mother.
Had it not been, I would have steered clear of it.
It was, in fact, an assignment for my book club.
Ohh...the smell of it.
The men were meer stick figures, less than two dimensional.

As teh back cover says, "based on the crimes of Ed Gein," more like based on Casablanca.
"Boogie Man."
Billy is the most lovable Pa's lil young'n in the history of all horror movies.
Anyways, watch for a "spooky" old man in a robe at the top of the stairs, Pa's speacial meat, random lines (ad libs?)
And I thought that William Girdler couldn't get any worse than ASYLUM OF SATAN.
The movie, no lie, switches from horror/exploitation into romance half way through.
And, you know what?
I've watched this movie 3 times ever since purchasing it and I still can't figure one thing out: is this a spoof or is it dead serious?
This movie is truly idiotic, has no direction, and includes some of the worst acting that I've ever seen.
Girder directed a very good movie once.
Boy,was I wrong!
It's a hoot and a half to watch.
such as "spider man," "Billy," and "i'll go sleep in the shed."
I think it's called "Boogie Man."
What a horrid name.

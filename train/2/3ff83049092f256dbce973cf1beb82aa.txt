Can that much horrifying stuff happen to one man?
Incest.
This book was extremely far fetched.
Everybody in this book is related in some way.
I would not wish that upon anyone.
Personally, I felt sorry for Oedipus.
I sure hope not.
Incest.
I was just grossed out by the end of the book.
Incest.
Do not get me wrong, this book was interesting, but there is a point when enough is enough.
This book is filled with incest.
It is way out there.
What a tragic life he lead.
It was a little much for me.

No luck.
Bright cheerful colors!
I'm taking it back today.
Had my 6'4", 260lbs, husband try... and he says, "I'm not going to do this anymore because if I put any more force on it, it's going to break."
She had no luck.
In other words... "it just "don't" work."
Vibrates the little one to sleep!
Read it again.
WRONG.
Had my best friend try to put it on after reading the manual.
From infant-to-toddler!
Still having problems.
Now, I'm not the most knowladgable person on this planet, but when putting something together, I've got what it takes to read a manual.
So, when I was having difficulties putting the cross brace on, I read the manual.
Couldn't be better, right?

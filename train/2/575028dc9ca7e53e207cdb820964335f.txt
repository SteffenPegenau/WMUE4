That guy is phenomenal.
Alice (even though he's probably 87 years old) has tons of energy.Now the bad stuff:1.
No extras at all on the DVD.
Not one.
Honestly, it's bad.
Great show.
Nada.I'm a big fan of Alice and have really been impressed with his last 2 studio albums (Eyes of A.C. and Dirty Diamonds), but this was a big letdown, mainly due to Alice's vocal performance.
The guitarists (Ryan Roxie & Damon Johnson) are somewhat average.3.
Good band, especially Eric Singer on the drums.
(To be fair, he sounds pretty good on the ballads.)2.
Alice's performance is stunningly weak.
Lots of songs, spanning much of Coop's career.2.
Video quality is superb.4.
He yells most of the songs, and the song Poison is just horrendous.
First the good stuff:1.

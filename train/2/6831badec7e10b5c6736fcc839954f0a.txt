I'm going to get rid of this one and check out some of his earlier efforts after "Acoustic Highway."
CDs like these, in my opinion, transcend an otherwise bland genre because of the distinctive, original style of the performers and/or because of original, fresh melodies that grab you; whether your a smooth jazz fan or not!
Who's CD is this anyway?
So, on a whim, I purchased this one.
OK...
Gone is the melodic originality of his first effort.
This CD isn't bad.
WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.
Chaquico's?
Rick Braun's?
To me, it sounds like the bland smooth jazz that I avoid on a regular basis.
Chaquizo's "Acoustic Highway" was such an effort.
Stan Freeman's?
It isn't that good either.I'm NOT a big smooth jazz fan.
It was the first of his CDs that I had ever heard and I love it now as much as I did two years ago.
But once in a while, I find some gems from that genre, such as The Rippingtons' "Black Diamond", Paul Taylor's "On The Horn", and Craig Chaquico's "Acoustic Highway".

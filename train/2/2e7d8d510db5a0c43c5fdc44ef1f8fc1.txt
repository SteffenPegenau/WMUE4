They love it.
They are stickers like you would find at a dollar store.
I am very disappointed in this product.
I recently bought this toy for my 1 year old triplets.
These stickers are just the right size for blocking the windpipe of the child for whom this product claims to be appropriate.
All of those characters that you see in the picture are stickers, instead of painted on.
**Find something else**
It's not as neat, but at least they could play with it.
I had considered trying to glue the stickers or find a way to make them permanent, but there is no way to do that without making the toy toxic to teethers.
In a word, cheap.
Now I have a $50 toy that my kids can't play with.
It is a great toy conceptually, but there is a major quality/safety problem.
My little boy played with this toy for 10 mins before I found a sticker on the couch.
Not special, extra sticky stickers, just plain, cheap stickers.
I should have just bought the parents brand one at Target.

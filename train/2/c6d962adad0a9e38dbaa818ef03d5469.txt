How is this a good idea?
You can't walk away and get your lunch ready.
You can't do anything, if it would require you to walk away from the grinder.
At all.Also, you actually have to stand there and hold a button down to operate the grinder.
It could turn itself off automatically, (We know this because that's what it does now; It turns itself off automatically).Summary - Pros: Cheap.
<$20 Cons: Does not empty completely.
There are way too many contours in the cup.
This silly grinder has too many parts inside the cup.
Lots of extra plastic parts.
Instead, they actually help to hold coffee grounds in the cup.
Why in the world can't they have a switch that you turn on and walk away?
The lid even holds grounds.
It cannot possibly be cleaned out.
User has to stand by it and hold button down to operate.
The parts are supposed to help clean out the cup.

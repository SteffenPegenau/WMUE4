Although it isn't 'bad' it isn't good either.
Why did I hate the characters I was supposed to like, and like the characters I was supposed to hate?4.
I, like most of you, read the description and some of the reviews and said, "I have to check this out!"
I'll do this in convenient list form.1.
Boring.
Annoying dialogue.
Certain characters were pointless to the story.3.
I am not a person who dislikes long books, I don't care how long a book is if it's entertaining and tells a good story, but this just didn't do it.
It tried to be a nonstop action fest, but all it did was confuse me on locations and characters.The only good thing is the message of the book, I guess.
Be cautious if you buy this.
Well, I did check it out and was very disappointed.
Even the end was far too long.
It was way too long.
You get this towards the last 1\4th of the book.
It had no reason to be so long.2.

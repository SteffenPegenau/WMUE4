Unfortunately, no such luck.
I might be able to overlook this, if there was an actual plot as well.
This novel read like a Gor book.
Endless preaching about the glories of "Foster," free-love and sex with many, many, available, willing young women (its amazing how these nubile women seem to fall all over the male characters.
But I purchased the audio version of Stranger in a Strange land and found it to be tedious in the extreme.
I loved some of his other works.
I am a fan of Heinlein.
He sounded like a little boy.Overall, some of his other sci-fi is better than this.
This book was nothing more than a soapbox for Heinlein to preach his personal life philosophy.
Really.
Ech.
Where is the action?
And I don't mean that sort!I also really hated the narration and the monotonous voice the narrator used for Michael Smith.
Where are the harems of men for the female characters?)
And the women are all completely unjealous of each other.

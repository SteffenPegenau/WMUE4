Doesn't matter.
It took a couple of episodes to get into it, because several new characters are introduced and for a while it seems unfamiliar.
One segment has a solid minute or two of a high-pitched tone that drowns out the sound.
Because the DVD "extras" are not actually on the DVD.
Shut up and watch the way Showtime wants you to watch.
Tough!
I find it to be just annoying.
Some people might like the rawness of the content.
You have to go to a web site to view them.Want to enjoy the extras from the comfort of your couch?
You may think you're a Dexter fan, but you're not: you're a potential video pirate.
You're lucky to even get an actual DVD in the box.Plus, the extra interviews are uncut, and the quality is poor.
Great show.Why the 2-star review?
But the stories are immensely intricate and satisfying.
Showtime doesn't want you to.But didn't you PAY for this DVD?
I'm a big fan of Dexter, and I really enjoyed season 3.

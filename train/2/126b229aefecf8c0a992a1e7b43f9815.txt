Stop agreeing with him.
I miss my heros.Long live Pern, it was great while it lasted.
He is ruining your masterpiece.
If I like half the story, then I will buy it.
Stop writing with him.
A mute harper?
I read it in the store first.
This story is ridiculous.
The "Shunned" reminds me of the "others" in Lost.
harpers are supposed to teach through song.
I miss my heros, Lessa, F'Lar, Brekke, Menoly, Robinton, F'Nor, T'gellan, etc.
Is Anne Mccaffrey losing her falculties that she is just aggreeing to allow her son to write these "stories"?
Everytime I see a new Pern book with todd McCafrey's name on it, I cringe.
How does a mute harper do this, through sign language?
May it rest in peace.
Anne, take your meds and open your eyes, your son is destroying the Pern series.

What about the implications?The author just seems to be pouring out his mind, conversing to himself while writing.
No plan, no organization.Imagine space/time as a loaf of bread, says he.
Sorry i took this expression from another reviewer, but it's just the right description.
What a failure.It's just a jungle of words and similes that only make it more complicated to figure out what he's talking about instead of stating the real thing, which would have been more helpful.
I don't know what to make of it.
What a brick.
Come on!
The book is waaay too long.
What difference does it make?
I can't see the implications.
But I quit because I came to a point that I felt: So what about all this?
I read most of it, as much as I could.
I saw his documentary on the Elegant Cosmos, or something like that, and it was fun, so I decided to read the book.
Why should I care about the fabric of the cosmos anyway?
There's no synthezising, no summary.

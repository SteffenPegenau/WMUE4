It might be ok to lay on your desk or something.
You screw into black plastic and then to get them out you can unscrew forever and it doesn't come back out.
This also doesn't work at all.
This is likely to kill any drive fairly quick if its transported.
When plugged into multiple computers, you can hear the drive spin but nothing is recognized on the computer.
The screws to hold the enclosure together won't come out.
I was hoping to luck out with a cheap enclosure.
I will end up needing to drill the screw out.
I finally found one that could see it, but any way I tried to use it caused an error message.
My drive is now stuck inside as well.
Ruining the product and my chances of a return and possibly the drive I put inside of this.
But this didn't work at all.
Tried multiple programs for disk management.
Oh yeah that's just the physical issues.
The drive inside is unsupported so it can move and rattle around.

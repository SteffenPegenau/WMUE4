.
Suddenly I found myself snacking and cleaning my plate (which I'd never done before).
I was disappointed with this book.
[...]There is nice information included in "The Taming Of The Chew."
.
And I began to gain some weight.
Like talking to an understanding friend.
[...]Again, "The Taming Of The Chew" is very much like talking to a friend.
until two years ago.
But this book just isn't useful.
If you are serious about ending compulsive eating, don't look for it inside this book.I'm fifty-eight years old and never had a weight problem in my life .
Two therapists could not figure out what was going on, so I began reading books on the subject.The best book I've found concerning compulsive and obsessive eating is "The Hunger Within."
But if you want quick, real-life help, try "The Hunger Within."
Nice.
It was making me angry at myself, and left me feeling sick.

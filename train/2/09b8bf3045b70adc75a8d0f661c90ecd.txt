Biggest complaint is that mega bass is more like puny bass.
Unless you pull out the batteries after every use, expect to waste alot of $ on batteries.
For some reason, my cassette player keeps shuttling forward to reverse playback when it is cold.
Although it hasn't broken for me YET, the battery door is cheap and looks very breakable; esp in light of pulling out batteries when not in use.
Besides I had to use my Xmas certificate from last year before it expired.

For the price , it is decent if you also believe the short durability of all cassette players.
I have owned this cassette player for 3 months now.
Liked my old Panasonic better.
The power button on the front easily turns on by accidental contact.
When it warms up, it resumes its normal function.
Must be averse to cold.Rave: 1.Price.

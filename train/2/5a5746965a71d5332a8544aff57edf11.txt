But I can not.
Read that.
Worth every second of my life.
Wow.
5 stars.
An awesome book is Howard Storms testimony titled "My descent into death".
I will just say that I put the book down half way through and have no desire for any further reading.
I don't know.
The best I can say is that her story of such horrible trama and struggle to find an answer is an inspiration.
I wish I could fill this with great info.
But the nuclear wars and all this Salt Lake City referance and death and distruction.
This one will not be recommended.
Good and bad.
And I read a lot of nde.
I won't pass judgement.

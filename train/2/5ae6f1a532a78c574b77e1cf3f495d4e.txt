Most reviews are by users who have used the zen touch for a short period of time.
Huh?And, most of all, I left it to charge one day and upon returning, it WOULDN'T TURN ON.
Some of the buttons don't do what they are supposed to.
Great.
I press play, and it skips to the next track.
At first, I loved the machine--I could treat it like a hard drive, use windows file types, transfer from machine to machine, etc.
When I try to scroll up, it scrolls down.2.
After scouring the help boards and emailing creative, I was told the machine was busted.
I plan never to buy a creative product again.
The warranty is, of course, expired, and there's nothing I can do.
However, I have had some MAJOR problems lately:1.
I have owned by zen touch for about a year and a half.
The scroll function doesn't always work.
The tech support was horrible, and as much as I like a lot of the features, these problems are bad ones.
I press skip to the next track, and it pauses.

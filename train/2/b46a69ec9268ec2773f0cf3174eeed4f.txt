There are just so many plot holes (not only between this book and the show, but between this book and the last book!).
It felt like this guy manybe watched the show through once...and took a few notes.
Im disappointed.
But.
Ill give him that tho....he captured Galen pretty well.
Cant win them all.
I dont know.
But thats about it.
Oh well.
I guess I am the only one who found this book to be a bit of a let down.
I know he did the outline.
Maybe the Technomage books will be better.
yeah.
I guess I just dont jive with this author.
I found the Bester books to be a completely believable addition to the B5 universe....as I read this....I just kept thinking....."Did JMS not even read this before it came out?"
As I read it, I just kept thinking...."there are so many things he COULD be talking about....why is he wasting my time on this!"

Second, I don't want to completely bash it... for there's a few good songs.
I have a few problems with this album.
This album sucks (read: is boring).
"Look Alive," "There It Is," and "Sloganistic."
But then again, everyone is harmless and most albums are too.
Thirdly... well, it's almost impossible to treat badly.
So f**k it.
Brand new, too!
Sorry Vanessa and Co., but I think you guys should of written more memorable material.
It isn't.
C-
When I think of this album, I think not of a specific song or two, but of how much it costed me -- two bucks.
A totally harmless work by what are probably really nice and harmless people.
Three to be exact.
First of all, I love Pylon's other albums, and reasonably expected "Chain" to be of equal quality.

The only saving grace was the special effects.
Originally Disney had this one opening against Episode III.
Take the cue from "Lord of the Rings" and do it as a trilogy.
This was just plain awful.
How could you just make one movie on these books?
Too faithful that is.
Do it right.
Wouldn't theat have been somethin'.
The fans deserve it, not a run through of the story at warp speed.
Whew!
Take your time, develop the characters, and for goodness sake, get a good cast.
Even then it really twerent special.
Suffers from what David Lynch's "Dune" suffered from.
Too many inside jokes and references.
A film version based on books should be faithful to the book, and I grant you this one is.

Each song blends into the next with no change in tempo.
Most of us dedicated fans still listen to the old material, dance, pop.
Despite what Janet says this is not a dance album.
15 year olds just aren't listening to artists from the 80's and 90's.
It's just doesn't have any stand out singles.
I don't know of any club that is playing this material.
It's not that it's a bad album.
Still it is significantly better than Damita Jo.
With this in mind it's puzzling that Janet would release 2 albums back to back with the same type of R&B / Hip-Hop material.
Madonna has figured this out, it's a shame Janet hasn't.
Which would probably explain the lack of air play.
Follow your fan base.
It's just not catchy or exciting.
Yes it's popular but your fan base isn't listening to this type of music.
It's rare that an establised artist gains new fans.

Forgive me.
Hitler was a murderer and a thug and a coward.
You may still bash me on reviews but that is ok, I deserve it.
And you're right, I should just write reviews on the damn product, lol.
I just want to say that I accept your beliefs socialist metal head, and I accept you.
Something came over me.
I'm sorry once again socialist metal head, forgive a stupid man like me.
I'm out
Hating people just isn't worth it, might as well see everyone as human beings no matter what race or belief system.
That is what I get for starting stupid fights.
And since I was the one that attacked you first socialist Metal Head, I apologize, i'm sorry.
I'm just letting it go.
I have a new look on life now and fighting over the past isn't worth it.
Both were revolutionaries and both failed.
I'm done of this bullSh&t.
I look at our back and forth reviews and I think to myself, what am I doing?
Forget Hitler, Forget communism and forget the childish bickering.
Lenin wasn't to much different.

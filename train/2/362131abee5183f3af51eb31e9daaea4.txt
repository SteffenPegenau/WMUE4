It was much freakier in all the other films.
We don't learn anything about any of the characters.
The director seems to be just connecting the dots here.
I am a huge fan of the TCM franchise.
In this version, it seems more like a flop house for freaks than a freaky house.
What?
Stop the madness.
There is nothing odd or imaginative added to the franchise with the addition of this film.
This film just did not do it for me on any level.
No mas.
MTV directors have no business going here.
The house is not even that creepy.
It amazes me to read all these reviews that are stating this is super gross, scary, or "surreal."
We do not see anything we have not seen before.
This is a nail in the coffin for TCM.
I went into this movie REALLY wanting to like it.
Please.
There are no chicken bone windchimes or anything cool like that.
There was no character that I liked, zero nudity, no suspense, not really any scares, and the gore is virtually off screen all the time.

I don't get what all this hyps is about this cd.
Its not recommended and even my best freinds heard it and they don't even like it.
The beat is just awful.
You will be disappointed.
All usher talks about on this cd is relationships.
And the other ok songs are "Caught up" and "Bad girl" and thats it.
i have to admitt that "Yeah" and "Burn" were good tracks but his third single "Confession(pt2) has to be one of the worst tracks i have ever heard in my entire life.
Dont' buy this cd.
Man give us something we haven't heard yet.
U mind as well just buy the singles "Yeah" and "burn", but dont buy this cd.
trust me.
This cd will be in the rash can soon.
It's not even that good.
It has no point and it lacks substance.
Very overrated.

He was bad for your Jewish cousins, if you are.
Iraq had around 23 million.
Also, he sent SCUD missiles at Israel.
Feldman, aren't you Jewish?
We have a right to put ourselves before them in importance due to our much greater numbers.
Feldman, just how would we have done that?
At one point the author, Feldman, talks about how the USA should have just replaced Saddam with someone more benevolent and not gone to war with Iraq.
Sure!
Terrorizing, national dictators often do manage to have strong states under their sway.
Strong state you claim he had, huh?
Think about that for a while.
Lastly, the USA has 350 million people.
Also, Saddam killed over a million of his own Iraqis amd terrorized close to all of them while he was in power.
He even provenly employed doubles of himself to thwart any attempted assassination overthrow of him by plotters.
Saddam was very determined to keep his postion in Iraq as leader.

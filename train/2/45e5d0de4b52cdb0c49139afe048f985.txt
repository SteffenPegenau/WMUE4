I like actin and mystery books so that is probably why I didn't like it.
Such as, Dan *nicknamed Demon* saw a crime being committed.
The main point was the Skin Heads can make you do things that you wouldn't normally do.
Even before that Dan was interested in them.
It was a little immature, but there was a point.
I personally did not like this book very much.
The Skin Heads hate anyone of a different race.
To me, it seemed stupid and in a way a little immature, as I have said.
At the Mall Crawl Dan, Laurel, and some of their friends saw the Skin Heads.
The author of Skin Deep is Lois Ruby.
After that Dan was brought in to their little group.
The Skin Heads had all sorts of tatoos.
The concept was okay, but the rest was just boring.
The Skin Heads saw him and told him not to say anything.
Dan didn't know what to do.
This is the reason that I personally didn't like this book.
He saw the Skin Heads beat up a store clerk that was of a different race.

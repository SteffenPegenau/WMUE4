Parents and shoppers beware: if you are in a similar situation, this doll is NOT your shopping solution.
I 'm a failure, birthday is ruined.
I guess Theresa doesn't need two arms....
Barbie is very appropriate for her age group.
They didn't wear pink warm up jackets in the 70's!
Boy was i all wrong.
Needless to say, I was very pleased.
So I see the words "Jam and Glam" and I'm thinking "Glam..."And it all seemed to fit together.
"Mooooommmm!!
The name of the doll is totally misleading.
She's only 7 mind you but somehow she knows more than I do about the era and I was born in the 70's!
Oh and durability?
So I wanted to buy her something (for her age group)to do with the 70's and glam rock for her birthday (she was born the same day as Nico, whoever that is).
Bowie and Nico wouldn't be caught dead in this!!!"
Now, I know nothing about glam and I'm thinking that Glam Rock Theresa or whoever would be perfect.
My daughter is very into David Bowie and the 70's glam rock scene.

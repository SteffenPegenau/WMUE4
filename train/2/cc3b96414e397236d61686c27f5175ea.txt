You can't just leave it like it's shown in the picture.
It also would work for a really small grill, but Not the type grill that's shown.
It blows off continuously.
The problem is that it is not Near Long Enough.
It's like throwing a sheet over the grill.
It's also a little thinner than I thought it would be, so won't last too long.
The lower half of your grill is left bare.
This cover looked great on the website.
When the string is tied, it makes the cover come up about 18 inches.
It's small enough to be used as a chair cover & might be useful that way.
There's a great deal of your grill that is not covered.
Only the top of the grill will be covered.
It's not.
You must tie the string that comes with it.
My old cover completely covered the grill.
It was a cheap price though, so it will get replaced as soon as I find a decent one.
Didn't look too bad when I received it either.
This is supposed to be the same size.

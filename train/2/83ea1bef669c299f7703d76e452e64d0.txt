It was a discombobulated farce of a cinema related excursion.....I half wanted David to morph into Bishop.
Thanks for helping me decide.
No...I WHOLLY wanted David to morph into Bishop.
This is absolutely NOT what I expected.
The dialouge, the casting, the etc.
Sorry your brother was going through difficult times Ridley, but Jesus, maybe it would have been better to step back for a bit.
This movie was complete tripe.
Let's see....14.99 could have translated into a cheap steak dinner or food for a month.
The only thing I enjoyed was David and his "knowledge".
It is an abortion of all the Alien series.
You have got to be kidding me.
Yes, I understand the complexities of CGI and so forth but Jesus Christ.......this movie fails on so many levels.
was malignant.
I just wish Bishop was there to guide him through this massive hemorrhage.
I wouldn't be this harsh on a newcomer, but holy fin christ, you really had to pay the rent didn't you.

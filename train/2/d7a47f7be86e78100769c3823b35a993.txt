Clifton Webb is an annoying presence in all of his films.
She was the only person in the entire film that I liked.
I was extremly disappointed with the film.
I thought Anne Baxter did a very good job in this film.
I had expected The Razor's Edge to be a much better film than it was.
I thought the basic plot of the film was good, but the movie seemed exaggerated and unbelivable to me.
I felt so sorry for her.
After reading the summary of the film on its box I thought it sounded interesting and rented it from my local video store.
Although I managed to get through the entire film I would never watch it again...
Another problem I had with the film was that I didn't like any of the characters.
His acting wasn't as stiff as it is in some of his other films.
Suprisingly Tyrone Power did a good job in this film.
I hated Gene Tierney's character.
She was a snob and ruined various people's lives out of greed and vanity.
I still didn't like his charactor, however.

Don't get me wrong though.
It's fun, just don't expect anything after you beat it in about 3 days.
I was upset after I finished it.
Like I heard in previous reviews, they don't have the "attitude" like Maxis was talking about.
This game was fun in the beginning.
I love the Black Eyed Peas.
And I heard they are trying to improve it by making an Urbz sequel........Hmmmmmmmmm
The music is awesome (I wish I could find those songs!)
That can't be all that's to this game".
Go RENT it.
I seriously think Maxis could have done a better job than that.
It's like "THAT'S IT??
I expected this game to have sims live more urban or street like than that.
But the game is.....so.....short.
I wish I was smart at the time to rent the game,but I was so eager to play another sim game.

This book was given to me by a good friend.
First of all, I hated the writing.
Difficult to interpret, difficult to read, I found myself frowning and too often left wondering what in the world Gibbons meant to say.
She greatly admires Kaye Gibbons' writing.
And the ending left me frowning again.
The story itself is nothing new.
Different strokes for different folks .
.
Unfortunately, this book didn't work for me.
was my reaction.
Since when did racial injustice have anything to do with this story?
Huh?
The two of us almost always agree about books, and she recommended ELLEN FOSTER highly.
.
I've read others in the same vein that I enjoyed more.
I felt as if Gibbons just threw that part in at the end to give the story moral weight, but since the only reference to race was in Ellen's reluctance to eat anything made by Starletta's mother, I just didn't buy it.

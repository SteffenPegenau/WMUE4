A true classic.
His lyrics have always zeroed in on what makes this man's heart beat.
But on this CD, Mona Lisa's smile has been altered.
Hell, put Tony Burrows on vocals.
No longer are we making love in the green grass behind the stadium but now we're running and laughing.
I think not.
This CD has many of his great ones.
But what really burns me about this CD is the song Brown Eyed Girl.
I've been a nut over Van "the man" Morrison since his THEM days.
That guy sang nearly every song in the late 60's anyways.
Greatest Hits?
If they are allowed to change the lyrics maybe next time they can change the players or the singer.
And in my opinion has tainted the entire CD.
It has a few of his sucky ones also.
The record company has decided that makin' love in the green grass is too paganistic for modern society.
By modifying the lyrics the song has lost its heart.
An Irish rebel.
A masterpiece.
His battles with the Parrot record company are legendary.

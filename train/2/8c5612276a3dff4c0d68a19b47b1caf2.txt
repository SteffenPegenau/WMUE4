The whole Chairman ordeal was very tiring.
It was a nice change.
And Hautsumono's character was eliminated too easily and without a boom.
I have read other Geisha books, studied Japanese and know people who live in Kyoto.
This book is very easy reading.
As if the author had no idea about their language.
It's almost laughable.
It is a wonderful story no doubt of the struggle of a young "Geisha" woman.
I read it in 5 days.
I could not help but laugh at some of the remarks only a Yank woman would say.
In fact the story was not even about Geisha at all.
This book is very American it's no wonder all the mindless Yanks love it!!
Only about 2 women trying to bring another down for treating one of them so badly.
Sounds like elementary reading.
It's almost the same as if a Geisha would read "Hollywood Wives".

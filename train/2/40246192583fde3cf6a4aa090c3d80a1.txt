(Borrow a copy first, if you can.)
(Enjoyable if you like background music.)
"Closing Credits" is (surprisingly) very enjoyable.
"The Pitch" (taken directly from the film) is quite good.
"Come What May" is so-so but the version on MR (1) is better.
)The diehard MR fans may enjoy this album.
:-)
"Your Song" (#8) is respectable.
(It's unique and intriguing.
The Tony Phillips remix of "One Day I'll Fly Away" is awful (minor keys and dischord).
But for the average fan, you may want to think twice before purchasing.
It's possible that this album may "grow" on a person, but I am not 100% sure.In any case, caveat emptor.
I rented Moulin Rouge and loved it.
"Sparkling Diamonds" is ok but the verson on the first MR cd is better.
"Your Song" (#1) is a nice ballad but doesn't seem to go anywhere.
"Ascension/Nature Boy" is slow moving.
But after purchasing Moulin Rouge 2 and listening to it, I felt that I had wasted [money].
I bought the first soundtrack, and enjoyed it immensely.

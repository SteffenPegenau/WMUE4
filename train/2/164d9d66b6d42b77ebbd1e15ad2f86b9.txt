For those I think the books is inspirational.
Many women I know have this need, but not the courage to cary it out.
It talks of following your heart and geting in touch wiht your heart.
I picked up Eat, Pray and Love several times in the bookshops since it was published in 2006.
Finally, at the bookshop a few weeks ago a friend asked, you haven't read it?
Several friends asked me: have you read the book?
OK, I said.
I put it down.
I finished reading it a few days ago.
I hadn't.
Let me get it for you.
Written in a breezy style, I felt it lacked depth.
It reminded me Sarah McDonald's Holy Cow.
However, I was empathetic with the Gilbert's need to do what she as doing and needed to heal.
The strengh of the book is that Gilbert does carry out her dreams and helps herself.

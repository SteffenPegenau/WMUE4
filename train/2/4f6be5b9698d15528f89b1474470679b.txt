I don't think so!
I met all the requirerments and still when I got SoF home it paused every minute.
I couldn't even enjoy the things the "Good" reviews said, because all that was pointless with the SoF speed!
It is ezellent if your computer can handle it.
I love buying thimgs from amazon.com, and I thought "of course this is good".
I'm informing you to this because I too was exited about buying this game.
Sincerely The Critic
Now, I have a SoG Cd Lying on the floor, possibly never to be used again.
So, your thinking of buying SoF!
Am I being too harsh?
Remember, Im not saying that SoF isn't good for everyone.
Big mistake unless you have a 500mgh Pentium Prossessor.
I recomend Pentum (or Athalon) 500mgz.
The system requirements stated 200 pentium or higher.
I was wrong!

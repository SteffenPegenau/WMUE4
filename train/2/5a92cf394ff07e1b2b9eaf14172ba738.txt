What should be subtle and smooth just ends up sounding schmaltzy.
This album is melodramatic.
The vocalist's style is over-calculated.
I still think that "Dreamless" is a very good song, but not strong enough to carry the whole album.
I think that this vocalist must be a big fan of Bryan Ferry.
I regret this decision.
What a disappointment.
This is certainly not a bad thing, but Bryan is a natural.
The arrangements are sloppy.
It sounds like he is an actor trying to play a part.
The mix is amateurish.
I had a copy of the track "Dreamless" and thought it was superb.
I couldn't find the album anywhere to listen to, so I took a chance and ordered it.
This guy is an imitator.
I was very excited about this album.
(Too much reverb on the vocal.)
This is too bad because his vocal quality is actually quite unique in a good way.

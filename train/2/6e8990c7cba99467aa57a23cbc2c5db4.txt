We got the DVD on noticing it in the local Christian book-shop.
I'm on book 8 at the mo' and my wife is rabbidly awaiting book 10(!)
I think it was the director who said - in the extras - that they felt the weight of expectation due to the fact that so many had read the book/series.
.
Well right from the off you notice the differences.
Maybe so, but it didn't stop him or the writers & producers producing a sadly lacking movie with little or no relevance to the book, except maybe in the character names.
No arguments, we just bought it as we loved the books.

.
Like a lot of others I was very disappointed.
Chloe's story-line is all wrong etc etc .
Buck is a TV journalist, most of the action takes place in the US, with no proper European/UK scenes.
It's a good film, not badly acted - bit dodgy on the special effects, but .
I'm not gonna buy the Trib Force movie, as I can only imagine what they've done to that one(!)
Things happen in the book as they don't happen in the film.

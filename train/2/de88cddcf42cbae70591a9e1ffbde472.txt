Claymore Mine... not a good idea.
Thats it.
Silencer description...OK.
Shot Gun Grenade Launcher... semi valuable.
Negative points come from thin content, vague content and limited application value.
The second is it's drawings.
This book, the first edition, is very simple.
Pipe Grenade... bad.
That is probabley it's best feature.
It describes the use of explosives, fuses and primers... but no formula(s).
All 4 minutes.
Its an elementary idea book at the most.
Mix two ingredients, wow.
If many of the other books presented the information in the professional format this book is in... it would be a miracle manual of sorts.
Rocket launcher... incomplete and no actual how to instructions.
Plastic Explosive...
If the other three are like this, I don't think Ill take the time to read them.
Blasting caps... good for beginers.

As romance novels go, I suppose this one is fine.
So he abuses her with cold behavior and verbal abuse for 300 pages!
And poor, poor, Leana.
Jamie really does love Leana.
But wait, he is able to climb into the marital bed and impregnate her within 7 days!
But wait for paperback, please.
She just loves Jamie with all her heart and is willing to endure all manner of humiliation.
Yuck.
There are no surprises in this one at all.
400 pages of boo-hoo-ing between 2 one-dimensional sisters and a weak, manipulative male love interest.
This is a harlequin romance dressed up in a fancy cover and hardback binding.
When Jamie realizes she's carrying her son, well, he will finally realize how much he loves her.
He just doesn't know it.
Her love is enough to change him and the world!
Oh Please!

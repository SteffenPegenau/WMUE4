I expected a lot more from this oven, bought to replace a flimsy B&D large capacity that lasted nearly 2 years.
The handles are not necessary and stick out too far.
The timer works for only 30 minutes, a definate minus.
I have a chicken I want to try roasting in it...but the timer will have to be reset.
Some insulation would be welcome.
Toast is beautiful...on top only.
You must keep this 4" away from all walls, backsplashes etc.
I can live with that.
They should have given this one a little more thought.
A real downer.
The paint was chipped where it met the chrome in my case too.
I bought this because of the brand name as KitchenAid always meant the top of the line to me.
It seems sturdy, but performance is lacking.
Likewise, garlic breadsticks that were in for only 2 minutes, not the 4 called for.
I made a potato casserole and the top burned.
One hour should be minimum.
A Barber Chicken Kiev was dry.

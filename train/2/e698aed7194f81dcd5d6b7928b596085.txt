There is no slow break-down of the moves.
The narration is useless.
The narrarator will commonly tell you to go into some pose, or do some move, but she's using a name like, "temple pose" without explaining it.2.
I've been doing it for about a year and have taken a class and done a couple DVD's.
It wasn't horrible, but it seemed very low budget.This is definitely an exercise DVD and not an instructional dance DVD.
But some of the moves can harm your back and neck and there is no attempt made to teach these moves in a safe way.
I am, by no means, an expert, but I am a fairly good dancer by nature.
It was a disappointing gift, but at least I didn't pay for it.
The ONLY way to follow along is visually.
And I don't care much for this one.1.
Nothing moved me.
Eh.
I call that sloppy and irresponsible.3.
I'm somewhere in the intermediate range of bellydancing.
I can see how a highly experienced dancer might get bored by that part, and therefore, enjoy the lack of direction in the DVD.

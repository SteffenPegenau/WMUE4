MxPx and the Goo Goo Dolls are REAL bands.
Um, did anyone like this soundtrack?
They don't write their music.
But please, your passing by Nine Inch Nails, MxPx, Anna Nalick, and Natasha Bedingfield albums...for...OH BOY, HILARY DUFF AND MYA!
And if you're into pop, try Natasha Bedingfield, Tori Amos, or Anna Nalick.
They're good bands.
It's awful.
It's more worthy, and it's GOOD!As for Hilary, she can go count her last few seconds.
THEY write, THEY produce, THEIR music IS good.So, instead of buying 2 decent songs, buy the NIN album, or the Natasha album.
Because (for some reason) MxPx and the Goo Goo Dolls are on here.
And so is Nine Inch Nails and Chevelle.
Puh-lese.
Actually, that's a lie.
It's pretty awful.
Really awful.

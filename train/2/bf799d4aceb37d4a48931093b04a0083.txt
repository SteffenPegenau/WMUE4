Not only is Hannah such a screw-up that she not only teases two men, but then decides that maybe she wants to try someone new?
Wrong.....
Come on, Joanne!
Sigh.
Norman needs to go find a woman who won't lead him around by the nose and then go chasing off after some pretty boy who has told her more than once that his job is more important than her!
I give up.
No more, Joanne - I didn't finish this one - - and I am really disappointed.
What?
You were afraid if you put her in a stable, loving relationship, we wouldn't read any more?
You make Hannah look like some kind of nasty tease.
BUZZZZZ!
And it is a shame, I was really enjoying seeing Hannah as a strong, thoughtful, considerate and loving woman, well able to make her decisions knowing that she could rely on her own heart.
Point me at Norman - I will take him if she doesn't want him!
I give up here.
Mike is a slut, Norman is everything a woman could possibly want, and this is what you do?

I like most of Will Ferrell's movies, and I thought Stranger Than Fiction was great.
All that being said, Will Ferrell did prove he does have acting chops.
Wife cheating on husband with friend?
I watched it with my girlfriend and we both decided that we want our 2 hours back.
Ironic, not creative.
Been done to death!
Been done way too many times.
If you don't like dramas, do not watch this movie.
Not showing his wife as a character?
I saw a preview for it and knew I would rent it.
The depressing friend Kenny?
He just needs better scripts.
But this movie is really contrived.
I did not expect this movie to be a comedy.
It's easy to depress people and have trendy ironic plot gimmicks, but it takes a little more to entertain.

The ending was terrible too, that is for anyone who knew anything about the actual incident.
The Plot?
Hollow!
Beautiful!
Unforunatelly, "Heaven's Gate" had no point to get across in the first place!
The scenery?
The characters?
Beautiful!
(I myself had to go back and watch "The Deer Hunter" quite a few times to get the appreciation back)
I just have to speak for any Cimino fans that think this film will be a great, step back and keep that great appreciation you have for Cimino because this could destroy it!
Cimino fell off the bandwagon.
The cinematography?
In history: around two people were killed.
The Deer Hunter is one of my favorite films, Cimino had talent when it came to that, but I don't know what he was thinking when he did this.
Michael Cimino's "The Deer Hunter" and "Thunderbolt and Lightfoot" were both very great films, both succeeded in getting their point across.
In hollywood: It was a hell of a lot more than 2 people.
What plot?

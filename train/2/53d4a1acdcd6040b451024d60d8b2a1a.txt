I was very disappointed, because the concertos and the Overture all together on one two-disc set would have been a treasure.
It's played up to tempo and is charming.
The Bronfman/Mehta recording of the piano concertos is wonderful for the concertos.
Because they slow the tempo (for some damned reason) and thereby ruin the whole piece.
It was enraging and I wanted to throw the whole thing away, and still may and find another recording of the concertos.
As a contemporary critic said of Tchaikovsky's violin concerto, it's ugly music.
The 7th Symphony.
I don't expect Prokofiev's string quartets to rise from the ashes as the Tchaikovsky did!
Prokofiev could have done so much, but he wasted his life being modern.
The Hebrew Themes.
The Piano Concertos.
But the Hebrew Themes (Julliard String Quartet) is dreadful.
The string quartets, on the other hand, are a horror!
I like things to be perfect.
Lt. Kije.
On this CD, however, the Overture is perfect.

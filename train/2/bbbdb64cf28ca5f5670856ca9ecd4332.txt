But the rest of the story was a let down.
Yes.
I was intrigued and found the character description of the crusty old sailor quite appealing.
There wasn't much mystery.
But with all the hype and glowing reviews surrounding this book, I thought I'd give it a try.
I read one of Sandra Brown's earlier novels and remember it only because I disliked it so much.
The writing was okay and the pace moved along at a pretty good clip, but the story line was lightweight and predictable.
It was like eating a Twinkie when what you really want is a big slice of triple chocolate cake with fudge frosting.
I have seen this book described as a romantic mystery.
It wasn't a total waste of time.
I knew where the story was going after about 60 pages.
Not much.
Explicit, uninteresting sex?
The beginning...the prolog of the `book within a book'...was very good.
Romance?

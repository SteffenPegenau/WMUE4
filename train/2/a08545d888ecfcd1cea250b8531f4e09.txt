Numerous firware upgrades since product release, but the product still won't actually perform this basic function with a modem.3.
Won't operate bi-directional with Win ME so you can't use the features of a "smart" or multi-function printer.6.
Tech support is horrid.
Seemingly no organized way to track issues on SMC's end.
Basic routing worked ok.2.
Dial-on-demand doesn't.
To avoid unwanted connect time, the unit must be configured so that all users must have administrative access in order to manually initiate dialing.
Print server is extremely slow.
Responses to others did not show professionalism or much technical knowledge.
There is a poor workaround, but it results in lots of unwanted connect time and it's buggy.
Very insecure.4.
1.
Useful only for simple text printing.
Administrative interface poorly designed and buggy.5.
Non-response to some e-mails.

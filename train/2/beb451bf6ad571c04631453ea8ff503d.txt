A begs B.
A hurts B.
Everything was actually very predictable.
Chapter after chapter I read thinking that it was the best book I had ever read.
I recomend it to people who stick to books after they buy them, like I had to do
A meets B.
B likes A.
But then, i noticed there were times when descriptions of uncessesary objects took up pages.
B forgives A. Wow.
The ending made me wonder if I was missing pages.
All in all, I read it in one day, so regardless it could not have been too bad.
I bought this book to read on a plane ride and I must admit that I could not let go of the book.
A likes B.
Add to this a boring family history and u have a somewhat boring yet addictive book.
B hates A.

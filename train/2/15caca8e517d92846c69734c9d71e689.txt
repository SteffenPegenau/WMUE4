Just a little creepy.
Even uncut, it isn't that sick or terrifying.
I have no idea why this movie was banned so much.
But I didn't get it.
Except for his complexion, he's hardly a threat.
Even the one where the ripper rips a fetus from a woman's womb and eats it isn't really all that disturbing.
This film had a real bad reputation when it debuted, but, watching it today, I really don't know why.
Or at least, he shouldn't be.
In fact, the gore scenes that are here are really not that great.
George Eastman, the guy who played the weird cannibal, moves about like a really slow zombie.
It's not that gory.
It's no big deal.
The people in the film he catches and kills must be really stupid if they let a slowpoke like him get to them.
The fetus was just a dead rabbit the producers bought at a butcher's shop.
Having just seen Anthropophagus: The Grim Reaper on DVD for the first time, I was hoping for a lot more gore.

thanks for reading this review.
i hope it helps.
i can't seem to find God in they're lyrics anymore.
well, i don't really have much to say for this record.
later as i got older i saw how they started to change.
i kinda feel bad about laying this new cd along with others.
i guess i just grew up.
they also got me into playing guitar and i started listening to more punk.
whenever i had a problem, they were who i turned to.
i always admired mike for his lyrics and catchy tunes, he was my hero.
there is a big difference between "slowly going the way of the buffalo" and "ever-passing moment".
now they don't even sound like the same band.
but i still listen to they're older cds and when i do, it's like listening to a story about my life.
well, i'm about 19 years old, i've been listening to mxpx since i was 12, they were my first favorite band and they still are.
i try to get into it.
now they're songs are about the same as anything you'd find at a music store.

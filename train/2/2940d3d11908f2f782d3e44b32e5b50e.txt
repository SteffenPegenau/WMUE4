How about "Drivin' Sister" by Mott the Hoople?
"Autobahn"?
The disks average about 50 minutes each; if I'm shelling out 60 bucks for four CD's I expect them to be packed.
Great packaging, as usual for them, but the music is slight and it's not a good value.
"Cars" by Gary Numan?
A car album without any Springsteen?
Rhino blew it with this one.
Here, there are maybe 5 or 10 songs I'd put on my personal "Driving Tape".
But my biggest gripe is the song selection.
OK, I know they have to get the licensing agreements, but there are hundreds of car and road songs--many here are forgettable or just plain bad.
"Driving" by the Kinks?
They could have easily put this on 3 disks.
Rhino used to be great about choosing the perfect theme mix tape collections--they did it with the doo-wop collection, Nuggets and many others.
However, I can't wait to put together my own driving tape.
I agree that the album doesn't flow well.

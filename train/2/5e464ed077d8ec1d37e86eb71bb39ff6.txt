Some of the actors were really terrible.
The plot was so loose you could hardly tell there was one.
It was all about a girl who was coping with the loss of her mother.
It was just terrible.
This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen in a long time.
Whoever wrote this was a terrible screen writer.
I am sorry I wasted my money on this.
And it wasn't about a horse at all.
It was an offbeat movie made practically by family members.
I had to fast forward some of it because I could not stand for lack of action to happen.
I think that might have contributed to the problem of lack of distance from the characters and loose plot.
The horse had about five minutes in the 96 minute film.
Unfortunately the girl was unable to show any emotion.
The movie dragged very much throughout.
The director must have been asleep.

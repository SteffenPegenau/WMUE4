Then I could've returned this, a(...).
Not to mention the carrier name.
When my parents told me that they'd bought me a cell phone, I was so excited.
This one seemed to fit the bill, so I rushed out and bought it.
BIG MISTAKE.I hate this phone now.
What's more, I wanted one with a camera.
Really, what kind of name is that?I only wish I had kept the original packaging.
I also hate the faceplate, external antenna, and green backlight.
However, when I got the package, and looked at the phone, a Tracfone Nokia 1221, I was sorely dissapointed.After that, I was desperate for a new phone.
I'm going to get a new phone.
Its a bit embarassing when someone asks you who your phone carrier is and you have to answer, 'Virgin Mobile'.
First off, the camera sucks.
Ugh.
Oh well.
And a good lesson learned, do your homework before you buy.

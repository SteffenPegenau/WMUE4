I really didn't feel that the characters developed at all.
I felt like I had read it all before.
And then read the rest b/c it will just get better and better.)
Block's lyrical writing fell short this time.
A lousy attempt.
I have read close to all of this authors books but this one left me disappointed.
Purple trees in LA.
Oh well, there's always Weetzie.
They were presented and weren't displayed in any more depth for the rest of the book.
Maybe I didn't like this book b/c the writing style was just an attempt at recreating her other books.
Or maybe it's b/c I live in LA and I know what it's like already.
You'll enjoy it b/c you won't have such high expectations.
It's been done.
Enough about the jacaranda trees, Francesca, we get the point.
The stage mom and the uninterested girl.
(However, if you've never read any of her books before read this one.
But it all just seemed to cliche to me.

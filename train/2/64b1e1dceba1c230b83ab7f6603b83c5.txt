To easy 2 die, terrorist shot one shot, and your dead, and you have to watch your teamates finish the game.
I don't have XBOX live, which would probably make this a better game.
4.
To hard to aim 6.
I have a few things: 1.
Don't buy this game when its still $50, wait for it to go down, or rent it, or get it used.
I bought this game the after thanksgiving, getting it on sale.
Its not worth your money at $50, unless u have friends with it and XBOX live.
i am extremely disappointed.
If your lookin for a game like this, try Rainbow Six 3, or if your new...Get HALO, every loves that game.
The graphics are like N64 or PS (NOTHIN LIKE HALO'S GRAPHICS) 3.
7.
The aiming recticle is like a dot, and i like it to be a little bigger.
You can't pick up dead players ammo, guns etc.

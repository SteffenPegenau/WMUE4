Maybe I've seen tragedy and her life just isn't it.
.
Yes, pain is pain, but I wish she had some sense to be more thankful for what she had rather than having to search far and wide.
.
I felt like this woman was so self indulgent and whiney.
.
However, I know many woman that just loved this book.
I kept thinking I'd eventually start liking her as she started travelling or something, but I couldn't.
I just couldn't relate.
..I really did.
She just kept annoying me and I kept rolling my eyes.
.
.
Why oh why did she have to tell everyone about her very important boring life?
.I guess it's memorable because I read it months ago and just the thought of that woman still makes me grit my teeth.
I tried to like this.

Track 5 is OK. Rest is mostly filler.
after you change the CD.
The southern rock twinge is actually pretty cool and Zakk plays some nice solos on the softer tunes on CD.
Too many tracks sound alike and the songs are just thrown together.
Pride and Glory should only be purchased from the bargin bin.
Now if you want good acoustic and blues from Zakk, get BOOK OF SHADOWS.
Sorry Zakk, but it sounds like you threw this together in 1 drinking binge weekend.
Look, Zakk rocks.
But it always goes back to the same thing for every artist--SONGWRITING.
I've followed his entire career, so when I say Pride and Glory is weak, I mean it.
Nothing you will remember 5 mins.
It blows away this lame effort.
It's just not good here.
ROCK ON BLS
Good move to kill the Pride.

Now, it is September.
I will attempt to get this replaced as it should still be under warranty.
Arrggh!
I did like the device for all its features in the beginning.
Finally, now the light does not turn off.
Anyway, buyer beware.
I first noticed this maybe two months ago.
The first problem that appeared was its inability to keep accurate time.
Hopefully, it's just my device.
Now, it resets randomly and enters setup mode.
The first couple times there was a difference I would reset/adjust the clock.
Seems that device is problematic.
There is no indication on the device of a weak battery.
It kept happening, so I decided to leave it alone for a month and the clock was over 20 minutes off by then.
I purchased this device in April.
The clock advances too fast.
Then the past week, new problems.
Not sure why, but its in setup mode and the settings/clock is reset in the morning when I ride to work and the evening on the way home.

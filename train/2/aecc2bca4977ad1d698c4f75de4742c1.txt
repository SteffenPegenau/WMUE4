you pissed me off with your crap writing.two stars for readability and the first part of the book.
It starts off well enough.
YOU THE READER OF AMAZON!
DON'T READ THIS BOOK.
It is only supported by having the characters suddenly able to do impossible things, like tell the future.
bad job Chuck.
There a neat loittle quirks in the characters and the writing style is casual enough so the humor does not seem forced.
Finishing this book was a bitter pill.
So an elaborate over the top storyline takes place.
but thats all.
I felt as if womeone tricked me.
Some books are not necessarily bad, But contain a dull story disguised under a really thick and "edgy" surface.
It appears as if Chuck Palaenguck created these very offbeat roles in the story and then had nothing to do with them.
BAD BAD BAD.
But then the actual plotline comes in.
The first half is quite catchy.
Survior was one of those books.

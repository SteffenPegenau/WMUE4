The Bad: However, for those of us with lives that like to game from time to time for some fun times, avoid this game at all costs.
If you have lots of time to master it.
This game could last forever for them.
Too hard.
The Good: absolutely beautiful game.
I am also told you have no life if you spend it all mastering the fine art of a VIDEO GAME.
It is flipping hard.
Is it for kids?
It almost pains me to write this review as I am sure people will hate my review as much as I hated this game.
I am told you will love the game once you do.
Will I keep it?
Good animations, great worlds.
This game is great for people who will take the hours necessary to master the racing in this game.
Without hours of practice, you will slam into 3-4 walls of every race, thus insuring your defeat and frustration.Bottom Line: Is it fun?
Nope.

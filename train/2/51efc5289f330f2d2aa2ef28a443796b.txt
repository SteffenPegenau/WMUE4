The quality of this product has deteriorated over the space of 9 months, and I would not now recommend it.
Not only did the space bare "clack", but the "N" key did not work properly.
I purchased one for work about 9 months ago.
This is quite sad, because otherwise the product is excellent.
The keys were tight, with no play.
The second one was worse.
I have notified Microsoft that they have a quality control issue.
The spacebar was very noisy - and drove me crazy.
The one I received had a quality issue.
It was wonderful.
I have an elbow problem that requires me to use an ergonomic keyboard.
This one is a bit better, but the space key is still bothersome.
So, I returned it and ordered another.
Microsoft is the only company that makes a proper ergonomic keyboard.
We then went to Best Buy and purchased another.
I liked it so much that I requested one for Christmas.
I have used the older version at home for years.

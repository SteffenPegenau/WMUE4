It just seems a little pointless.
Throughout the film when something big is about to happen, it just comes across different death scenes like slasher films.
But I had my worries.
Not half as good as the ending to the original.
After seeing the first Saw I was so looking forward to this one.
Saw is NOT a slasher film.
Saw 2 not only has similarites, but looks almost exactly like it.
People locked in a house full of traps, entering the first room to get to the second.
Saw 2 still has a neat ending but also added something a little silly to it.
Its like they just want to get this film over with.
I loved the first one, but unfortunatly this doesnt come to the standards of the original.
Overall, Saw 2 isnt rubbish.
Sure this film is a lot better than Cube, but it could have done a lot better than this.
I have noticed how people have compared the original Saw to the film Cube with its similarities.
Saw 2, however, follows in its footsteps, finding an easy way out.

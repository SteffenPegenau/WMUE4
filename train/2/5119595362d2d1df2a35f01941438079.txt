Quickly lost interest in it.
Specially during a 3 or 4 player match.
Brawl.......This game was fun at first.
Decent amount of characters to choose and unlock.
It is easy to lose sight of your character.
There graphics were OK, nothing spectacular.
I had this game for less than a week and traded it in.+Playing on-line was great.
There is no zoom option.+The speed of this game is sluggish.
Could have been much faster.Thought this game was going to be fun.
I thought wrong.
Even when the match is only 2 players the characters are tiny.
Super Smash Bros.
These were the only 3 highlights of the game, for me anyways.+One player story mode gets old very quick.
It didn't not take long to connect to a battle.
Like I said, I lost interest in this game after only 2 days.+The characters on the screen are way too small.

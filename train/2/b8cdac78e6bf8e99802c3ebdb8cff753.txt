Putting Alternative/Pop music into a movie automatically makes me take the movie less seriously.
The music choices for the film were terrible.
When I thought I'd rent Antitrust, I knew I was taking a chance.
Antitrust defines the word typical very well.
Everything was so formulaic.
I was highly disappointed in the quality of Tim Robbins acting.
The acting, which was poor, hurt the movie a lot.
Ryan Phillippe is a good actor, but he doesn't have the stuff to carry a movie all by himself.
The directing was OK, but nothing to brag about.
I now know why Antitrust was on the bottom shelf at Blockbuster.
But I did think Milo (Phillippe) figured everything out way to quickly.
It has seemed his film career has really taken off lately, but it takes a step back with the making of Antitrust.
Everything was so predictable.
And the bad guy/good guy was easy to figure out.
It has "B" movie written all over it.

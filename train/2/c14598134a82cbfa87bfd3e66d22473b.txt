What could have been a great set is merely average.
What nerve Paramount has.
NO interviews with the actors or creators.
Seinfeld Season 4 has 13 HOURS of exclusive special features!
ADS!
The Seinfeld fans get extras galore.
What DO we get?
The company has so little regard for the consumer.
Crass commercialism has spoiled the legacy of Frasier, a show that so many people worked so hard on.
NO bloopers.
This fan is very disappointed.
NO deleted scenes.
NO commentary.
We loyal Frasier stalwarts get nothing.
NO extras of any kind on this set.

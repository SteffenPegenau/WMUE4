What was I thinking?
I sent it back got my refund.
For no reason, one day the LCD just quit.
In less then a week, after purchasing this, one of the slots where the screen opens and closes broke off.
160 GB hard drive 1GB of ram, Dual layer DVD+/-RW drive upgradeable to 2.
Why did I attempt this three times?
Under $700.
But, WARNING You get what you pay for, I guess.
Tried to fix it, then, the DVD drive wouldn't work!
Returned it, was charged a restocking fee.
Stay away from cheap, low prices pieces of garbage.
It looked good.
Long story short.
I'm not happy at all!Ok.
Got another one.
I re-purchased the same computer laptop, Surprise surprise, dead pixels on the LCD screen.

What else would one expect from "canvas."
It's quite obvious.
The bag was also, in overall size, too small.
Another concern, which I chose not to think about, was the fabric.
The bag is taller than wide.
The fact that it has a divider to separate the contents does not matter.
But for a purse...well for me.
That is, obvious to me.
No.
I have no doubt, this will make a good purse or "man bag" for the right person.
Which means, digging around in the bag to find what I am looking for.
In retrospect, I should not have purchased this bag.
The "yellow" lights were blinking in my head as I was completing the paypal process.
Canvas fabric is "tough and rough(rough to the touch)."
Why?
Thank you.I will say this, the bag is well made: fabric, stitching and hardware.

12 DAYS!
YA HEARD ME!~!~!
It was in a interview that he said he made his album in 12 days.
That is irratating.
I just know good music when I hear it and this aint a good album.
If you want some quality music go and get that 504 Boyz.
You cant make a good album in 12 days.
And ONE more thing.
People who read this review might say that I'm a hater, but I'm not.
Miracle cant rap.
Well to start, I'm not a fan of Miracle and Pastor Garbage, also known as Pastor Troy, and with this album it proves why they dont have alot of fans.
Miracle needs to give it up, cause whoever told him he can rap............THEY LIED!
The 2 songs that get tha 2 stars are: We fittin to do this, and P & D. And that's about it.
This album brings nothing except hard knockin beats.
But on tha other hand if you got a tight system in yo trunk, go head and pick this album up, cause it'll keep tha system knockin.
Just listen to his voice.
Come on now.

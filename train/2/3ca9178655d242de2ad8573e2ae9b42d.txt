wtf?
after nine years of marriage he figures out he shouldn't be married...so he obsesses over dead girls.
who cares?
socially inept or sociopaths.
one artist: just plain of nuts--and a serial killer to boot, another: a womanizer who abuses girlfriends, another-the protagonist--need i say more...., yet another---bi-sexual-sleazy-wacky.
she dies so he chases and catches her twin sister.
how goth!
i expect this from bad tv sitcoms but not from an acclaimed writer.
the protagonist was so unbelievable.
can't have the dead one may as well fall in love with a completely different person who looks like her.finally, and yet another stereotyping of visual artists.
he finds out one is in "love" with him while never meeting him for more than 10 minutes.
i have heard so many good things about oates.
the writing was confusing.
and people give stig larsson grief?
it is no wonder why she wrote this under a pseudonym.
wow.
what a turd.
who is this guy?
really??

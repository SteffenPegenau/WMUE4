i mean not even close.
when i finally got a "decent" fit, the sound was nothing special.
When I took them to the gym the first day, they kept falling out of my ears.
high end a bit harsh.
a bit weak on the low end.
Soo back home i went, and sat for 30 minutes adjusting the different fittings.
Based upon all the reviews i read, I couldnt wait to get these ear buds.
they never did fit snugly, and quite fankly, all i could think was..this is a lot of work for a dopey pair of earbuds.
alas, i did not take the time to properly fit them to my ears.
I must completely disagree with the rave reviews.
Just an overall negative experience for me, so back they go to amazon..and i am back to my ipod buds.
I could not find a comfort fitting.
nada.
to each his own i guess.
I could not have been more disappointed.

It is written with too much biblical content.
Secondly, Leah is not a believable cahracter.
Thirdly, this just isn't well written well.
This just isn't your best.
Overall, I would have to say, Come on McDaniel.
This book did have some strong points.
I read Lurlene McDaniel's book, Angels Watching Over Me, but I didn't like it.
What's the problem with this stor?
The character of Molly was well developed and Leah's feelings about Ethan were well demonstrated.
This was definitely not her best work, as I've thoroughly enjoyed some of her other novels.
This isn't going to happen in real life.
This contradicts her own statements.
Leah talks like a women from a few centuries back and doesn't act at all like a teenager.
Her books are supposed to be about life.
McDaniel needs to face reality.
Firstly, the plot is a little farfetched.

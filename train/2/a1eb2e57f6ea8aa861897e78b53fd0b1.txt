I'll certainly be careful on my next purchases.
I wonder how John Hughes feels about these crappy re-issues?
LastlyThere were no inserts in the box.
THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE QUALITY OF THESE 5 STARFILMS!!
!I'm a HUGE fan of John Hughes.
Here are my gripes about these releases.
How could they considerthis to be 5.1 surround when I didn't hear a peep out ofmy back speakers?
DTS?
First the picture quality is grainy and fuzzy onSixteen Candles and not much better on the others.Next the sound is horrible!
I don't need a booklet, buta chapter listing would've been nice.
It's not!
Ugh!
Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club and Wierd Science are totally essential forany 80's Teen Film fan.
I thought I would be hearing the brilliantNew Wave soundtrack in DTS surround.
I thought the DTS logo on the back of the box assured a degree of quality.

Games aside...
It is targeted to boxers and from what I gathered, only boxers.
It isn't well written or interesting at all.
On my own part I would have to say I have never read any of the author's other books and dont know much about them.
(Fighting Power, Speed Training)
I had a friend help me do the bean bag drill and I feel we wasted alot of time for nothing.
I would like to conclude that if you think that this book will warm you up for martial arts...it may but there are more, far better books for the same price if not less.
I have read alot of martial arts books.

If this is a template for the other's, I will not waste the time, let alone the money.
In this one, the title is misleading.
While I am not claiming to be a "martial artist", I have tried, to reasonable extent, most of the proccesses and training in such books.
Play dodge ball.
It is way more physically demanding and fun.
I didn't care for this book.

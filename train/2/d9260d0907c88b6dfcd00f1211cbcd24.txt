The kids, of course.
It has a good story but it isn't described well.
In conclusion, this is not an excellent book.
But will they get massacred?
Sneaking 75 pounds of gold on your sled in attempt to save your nation from an undesirable Nazi invasion?
For ages 7 to 9Have you ever sneaked candy at night?
The answer is right under their noses...
Will they get caught, trapped, cornered or tortured?
I think not.
Read the book to find out more about the kids and their dangerous and perilous adventures.I don't recommend this book because it is not written well.
Have you ever stolen cookies?
Some have, but have you accomplished this?
Only read this book if you love true stories.
Otherwise don't bother.
These courageous children did precisely that.In Riswik, Finland the Nazi invasion is reeking panic all over the country and how will they save more than 13 tons of gold from the enemy?
I'd try another book.

If you notice an improvement, bravo.
My suggestion: Buy three bottles.
Some swear by this product as helpful.
Have monthly blood tests.
Take the recommended dosage "religiously" on a daily basis until you have completely depleted the supply.
Everyone that cares had all sorts of remedies to recommend.
I bought this because I'm grasping at straws.
Will it work for you?
It, along with the other homeopathic remedies has done nothing to arrest the condition.
I was diagnosed with CLL (leukemia) in the latter half of 2010.
I hope so.
This was one of them.
My counts continue to rise (into abnormal range).
Is your life worth that?
If you don't, then you are only out about $20.

I tried to go along with the crowd.
Perhaps blowing someone's head off, or shooting them in the back is entertaining.

I was told "the accents are great", "the acting is wonderful", "you are transported right to Minnesota".
I tried to view this highly recommended film with an open mind.
Stand up for yourselves, go see a good movie.
Instead it was mind-numbing and violent.
It was for the pulp fiction crowd.

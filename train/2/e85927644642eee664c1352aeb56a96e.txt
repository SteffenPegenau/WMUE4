I don't even know they made another TV series.
I watched the 2 mini series when they were on TV long time ago.
They definitely ran out of money.
So, I bought this set thinking what a great deal to have 2 mini series with a great price.
I can even see the couple of film crews and the cameraman wearing a T-shirt from the reflection.
The performance from the actors are good but the story seem rushed out from the writer.
After watching the first 4 or 5 episodes, I have to let it go.
I was so wrong.It turns out that this set is actually a regular TV show that was made after the two mini series.
I loved the 2 shows.
The episodes are slow and boring.
Too boring.2 stars.
Can't watch this series anymore.
LOL.
Never heard of this.I guess they ran out of budget.
Nope.

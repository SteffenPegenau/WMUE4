Bummer.
I also have small children and a dog.
Certainly didn't disappear before my eyes.
New or old stains, nothing.
Basically, I have no shortage fo stains and I was SO SURE this would work after reading all the reviews.
Old urine spots, a strawberry milk stain, chocolate...
Even random old spots from before I moved in..
It hasn't seemed to effect any of them.
I rent an old apartment with off white carpet.
I searched the internet last night for the best carpet spot remover.
I went to Home Depot bright and early this morning and bought a huge jug for 17$.
I was sold.
I don't know what the deal is or why this seems to work for everyone but me, but honestly it hasn't gotten anything up.
By FAR the best rated product I could find was this.
People raved about it!
The carpet around whatever spot I treat does look super clean after, but the spot remains.

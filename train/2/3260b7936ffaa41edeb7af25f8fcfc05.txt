I am sure there are some health benefits to drinking this stuff, but here are my qualms:Taste is not like it came right out of the shell.
It has a boxed like taste.Sugar is too high.
I have this on auto delivery, but I am going to cancel it today.
My diet is varied and provides more than enough of these nutrients.
A diverse diet is best.
I can't have that amount of sugar on a regular basis.
For hydrating nothing beats water.
For potassium; plantains are good.
I workout every day and run as well as chop wood.
Blood test was excellent.
I will just take a supplement.
Nutritional content; I am sure it has some of the qualities that it boasts, but I am not willing to make the sugar compromise for the magnesium/potassium benefit.
Plus I eat way to much cocoa and that has the highest amount of magnesium from a natural product.
They are just like bananas.
It is cheaper.

cool.
He was campishly(is that a word?)
It didn't really have anything to do with the story anyway.
I thought Hollywood had moved past that, but apparently I was wrong.
I love the sci-fi/fantasy-action genre so, naturally, I figured this was my kind of movie.
She has all these cool weapons but she never gets to use them.
The character of 'Anna' is completely wasted.
She's just there to be tossed around by the bad guys and to serve as the object of Van Helsing's lust.
But, all in all, it was a waste of my money.
The only good part was the character of Dracula.
Now, Underworld, there was a good fantasy-action movie.
I heard about the negative reviews this movie had received, but I decided to give it a chance anyway.
I regret it.
He has ancient memories, he has past history with Dracula, he's the "left hand of God" - whatever.
I couldn't bring myself to care about any of it.
Van Helsing himself is completely uninteresting.

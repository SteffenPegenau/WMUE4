When I decided on it, I knew I was taking a chance.
The voice recording was surprisingly ok. Then, on the third of having it in my possession, it just quit.
I don't know who to trust.
It arrived and I was extremely excited.
I charged it.
I had barely used it.
I hope that it just happened to be the one I received.
I did lots of research before purchasing this product.
The fm tuner was amazing.
It just wouldn't turn back on.
It charged great.
If so, I would change my rating in a heart beat.
The main problem is that now I am very scared of buying an mp3 player.
The two is for 2 days it did work.
I let it rest.
Adding Mp3s was so simple.

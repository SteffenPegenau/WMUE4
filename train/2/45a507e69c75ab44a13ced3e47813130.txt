But only just.
Come on!!
It is not musical.
Come on people, this is a terrible record.
Ha ha ha.
This goofball.
To say it gets old... well... it IS old.
We hear a lot of musicians, but not much music.This era is the reason why some people find Dylan only semi literate musically.
Just yelling.
Here we find Dylan at a dead end.
Lots and lots of yelling.
It is uninteresting.
Just yelling.
Dylan did such quantities of drugs before these shows he has only one dynamic style.
Not a peak.
Dylan does some terrible performances on here that are what explain why the 1970s got a bad name.
But taken on his own terms -- a rich, stoned professional yeller from the 1970s whose audience is overindulgent -- this is one of the greatest albums ever.

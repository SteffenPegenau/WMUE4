That's got to be the stupidest thing ever!
Oh, and by the way, the little boy that makes cat noises (Meowwwww) isn't scary!
Besides the shining and certain exceptions, I usually don't get scared during unrealistic horror movies.
Well, anyway, that's all I've got to say.
That's not what I call scary.
But if you liked it, you'll love it.
Just like the boyfriend in the ring.
And of course, her boyfriend wants to die too so he goes in also.
The plot centers around a haunted house in Japan, and everyone that enters this house shall die.
This one isn't scary, and tries to scare you by randomly showing someone's eye on the screen.
Both were unninteresting and not scary.
The movie isn't particullarily scart, and if you dissliked the ring like me, you won't like this.
I found myself laughing every time he'd Meow.
This is due to some curse and of course when Sarah Michelle Gellar goes inside it, she's got to find a way to save herself.
This movie is like the ring to me.

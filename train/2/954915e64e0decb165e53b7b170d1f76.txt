The dream sequences.........Why are the there?
They also seem to take this whole 'rock star' persona way to seriously.
Long live Zep...........but you don't need this DVD in your collection.
This movie has not aged well.
I must have seen this movie 20 times at the local theatre.
I LOVE ZEP.
I have never been able to stay awake through the whole movie.
I still fell asleep.
Spinal Tap was a spoof.
The band looks very bored.
I thought at the time it was because we were staying up past midnight to watch it and we were just to tired to make it to the end.
But this movie reminds me too much of Spinal Tap.
So when I picked up the DVD and brought it home after not seeing it for so many years I thought "I'm finally gonna be able to see this movie from start to finish".
Friday and Saturday nights at midnight they'd play Rock n Roll movies.
This was not and looks like one.

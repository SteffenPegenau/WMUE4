I was as pale as I was before I used this product.
I used gloves, started at my feet, and worked upwards.
I must stress that this product is NOT good for the FACE and NECK !!!
Not so!!
I decided to use the product before I went to bed.
SPOTS...SPOTS...SPOTS !!
I have tried so many different self tanners and I was hoping that this product would be the one that I stuck with.
I exfoliated, moisturized and then waited about two hours to let that set.
I tried using this again the following night and in the morning after showering I was very spotty.
I followed the directions and I still don't know why this product has such high rating.
Not only does the product go down the drain when showering, but so does the money spent.
I will admit the product has a great scent, but that's about all it has.
When I showered in the morning ALL the color went down the drain.
I let it dry for about two hours before putting on loose clothing.
I had to use an exfoliator to get rid of the spots.

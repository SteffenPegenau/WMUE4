This is the 2nd Gaskin book that failed to hold my attention.
Not much character development.
I kept waiting for Livy to have a conversation with Dena or Ginny about her feelings over the sudden loss of her only remaining parent.
I gave up on this book whose author can kill off a character so easily with the related characters being so unaffected.
The stage set and characters showed great promise in the beginning.
Just bland.
For example after Livy's mother dies suddenly, her grief is expressed by sitting in the kitchen sullenly with her dog and cat.
The book then just flows right into WW II and the changes in the household that come with the war.
Seemed like it could be an interesting saga.
I won't be trying any more.
No sense of the characters having feelings.
Literally and figuratively put me to sleep.
IMO it draaaaggggeed.
Not quality writing IMO.
I read about 20 more pages after the mother died and nothing.
She's not the author for me.

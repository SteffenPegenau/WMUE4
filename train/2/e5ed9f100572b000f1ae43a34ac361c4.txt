F-22's?I was totally disappointed with this book.
Do we need to know how much Ryan hates his job over and over?
Cruise missles?
The US would do nothing after a Nuclear missle attack?
Talk about a change of character from the beginning of the book.
First off, I'm a huge Clancy and Techno thriller fan.
Fang would go talk to the people at the end of the book?
Probably not.
B-2's All of this equipment could strike at China's forces from the beginning?
Run out of bombs?
Why were we not using B-1B's?
As another review said wait for clearance or get it from the library.
However, I found this book long and very un realistic.
Was all the "sausage" talk necessary?
We do it all the time?
Ever heard of in flight refueling?
Normally it is much more difficult to find discreptencies from reality in his books?

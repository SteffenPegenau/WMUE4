I was glad when it was finally over.
Now that's an exciting movie!
It didn't.
The beginning of "The Conversation" showed so much promise.
Gene Hackman did a great job portraying a very paranoid man.
That lasted only the first 15 minutes.
I much rather watch "Enemy of the State".
If you base the movie solely on the way Gene Hackman played his character it was great.
After that I struggled to finish watching it.
I was bored almost the entire movie.
I liked it and was interested.
The reading of all these positive reviews baffles me.
I watched the entire movie only to see if it got any better.
Did I see the same movie everyone else did?
However, it is everything else in the movie that makes it not enjoyable.
The person I watched it with fell asleep.
Maybe I just don't get it.

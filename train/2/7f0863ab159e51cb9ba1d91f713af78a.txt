Also unfortunately this record is being grouped in the Folk Rock genre along with Harvest, Harvest Moon and Comes a Time.
It just isn't.
And that's very unfortunate because the writing is superb.
Whether it's due to him viewing his own mortality with his brush with death or the passing of his father last year, it doesn't matter.
Unfortunately musically, that's where most of this album belongs.
I stock Neil Young records in the "Must Have" category.
There's no semblance of country rock here that other publications are calling it.
The tempos drag as Neil tells his stories.
It's too bad the vehicle the words ride on is only firing on a couple of cylinders
That's not to say he puts both of these elements in the same song.
The word smithing is strong.
This is realy Silver & Gold PtII.
Tepid Folk music is more like it.
He's got enough material to fertilize a cow pasture.
When I need the right words or the right crank, I put Neil on.

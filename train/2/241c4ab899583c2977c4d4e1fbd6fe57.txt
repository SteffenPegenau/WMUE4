Normaly serj's department.
Their debut was spectacular, toxicity was subpar(why every one prefers it over their self titled is beyond me)and steal this album was brilliant in some places.
Smart people outsmart each other, then themselves.
Oh those were the good old days.
The same line repeated over and over again.
What has happened!!!
Please!!
!
Hes also to blame for the decline in lyrics.
I saw byob on the tele and got all worked up, well ive never been so let down in my life.
The lyrics are totaly trite.
This cd is horrific, i feel like i want to cry.
I just hope hypnotise is all serj to make up for this mess.
I cant stand hes voice.
Daron sounds like a whiny prepubecent teenager.

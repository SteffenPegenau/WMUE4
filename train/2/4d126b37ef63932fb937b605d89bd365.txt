Get A Job.
This movie was kind of disapointing to me.
This would bee a new experince for her.
I thought it could've been a lot funnier than it was.
Can ray show molly how to become an adult?If you liked this movie check out the soundtrack.
There is only one thing diffrent between the two.
Molly(Murphy) is a daughter of a dead rock star who is living of his fortune, one day her accountant runs away with the money and there is only one thing she can do, and have never done.
Molly is 23 and acts like a kid, Ray is 10 and acts like an adult.
She's a good child Actress.
thats why i didn't like it.Plot.
She becomes a nanny of a Spoild brat named Ray(Fanning) who thinks the whole world Is A Germ Infested place.
One of the best i've ever seen.
The story of the movie was okay, it was slow and boring.
The Performance of Dakota Fanning was ecxellent it was so good.
The performance of Britnay Murphy was okay, she could've been better.

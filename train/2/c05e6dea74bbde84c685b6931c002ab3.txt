Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis Still have a lot to give.
Please, Samantha can get over herself anytime.
The people I let borrow it said it was a waste of their time also.
It's like they are little girls playing dressup.
Live and learn.
SJParker has made enough money.
I wish I had saved my money.
They aren't older trying to act like they are still in their twenties.
Those STUPID hats that Carrie wears?
Fifty years old and still playing the I'm hot and horny teenage tramp role?
I just didn't buy it.
She looked haggerd, and her hair always looks oily for some reason.
They are beautiful, and act very well.
Over acted, actresses too old to play their parts.
Time to retire, sweetie and retire to the good life.
Kim...If it were not for Sex, you would only , maybe be remembered for a ditzy cop, and a manniquin, and it doesn't take much acting for either role.
Forget it.
People are already talking about you.

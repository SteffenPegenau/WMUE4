I don't know.
I don't blame her for that but she shouldn't have promised seven books, if she wasn't up for it.
URGH, it makes me so mad!!!
What's the deal?
I just wish her luck with he next book!
Maybe Rowling's just tired of having to write the same series for so long.
I don't know.
Darn, why does the style have to be so good!
It was such a pain to read.
Good luck, J.K. Rowling!
The whole series started out so good.
The only thing that made me finish it was Rowling's great style.
Does Rowling think that becuase she's rich, she can stop putting effort into these plot lines?!
Up to the third book of the Harry Potter series was really good but this one...ugh!
Harry Potter has gone from a fun magical person to a depressed teenager.
It's really a shame.

And darkness.
You know you are a true fan of zombie films if you were excited for this sequel.
This film just relied on shaky camera work mostly.
All I need say was that there was a star zombie and a nuclear zombie family.
A small chopper can not go from London to Paris.
A few scenes do not make a good film.
Suspension of disbelief is one thing but common.Skip it till DVD.
Aside from a few very well done scenes this film was no good.
I was let down.
The plot went no where and did not propel the story anywhere except to Paris.
A lot of darkness.Forget the plot.
Wait for cable.
I am not sure how with more money it is possible to screw up the sequel to what is arguably the best zombie film ever made but they did it.Zombie films are not for everyone.
Mostly the film and more importantly the zombies did not have the raw, visceral, jacked, amped on speed and crack intensity the zombies from the first film did.
I was amongst the few hopefuls.
A zombie film with family values.

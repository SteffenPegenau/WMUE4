This CD leaves alot to be desired.
Even the choice of photography on the sleeve misses the boat.
I expected alot more from Madonna.
The rest of the ballads are repetitive and unmoving.
The first cut, "Music" is fun and the second has a good beat.
It was like a quickie in the interim while she does her life.
No profound message.
No significant lyrics.
There is one beautiful ballad.
Overall, it is nothing special.
No catchy tunes.
No really great dance tunes.
A let down after "Ray of Light" which was really well done.
I bought the CD hoping to use it in my dance class.
Madonna looks beautiful but the choices are strange.

.
This one goes to the UBS.
Did I miss them?The love story between Nathaniel and Alexandra got lost in the midst of all the plot.
.
I didn't leave with a feeling that these two were meant for each other, that they _had_ to be together.
Prose = so so .
.
Plot = overdone .
.
.
Characters = disappointing .
.
.
A very dark and depressing book.
.
Love scenes = were there any?
So many things happened to these two that it was almost ridiculous.
Detail = excellent .

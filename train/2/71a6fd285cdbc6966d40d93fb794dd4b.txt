I'm glad I was able to remedy the situation.
Glasses are not included either.
Horrible digital grain as well.
But come on Sony!
The 3-D encoding is awful!
7 is for the 3-D titles that I enjoyed as a kid.
So...
I used DVD shrink, ripped the tittles, opened up my Xilisoft 2-D to 3-D video converter program and BAM!
Why is it that I did all of this on my crappy PC home computer in about an hour and a studio like Sony can't get it right?
Lucky for us, the 2-D versions are there.
The only reason I bought Stooges vol.
Not to mention, what's with the magenta and green encoding?!
I must give Sony credit for including the 2-D and 3-D versions of Spooks and Pardon My Backfire.
Burned it onto DVD, threw on my standard red-blue 3D glasses and it looks amazing.
Sure that is one way to do it but red-blue is standard with the anaglyph format.

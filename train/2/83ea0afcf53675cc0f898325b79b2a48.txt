Grisham generally paints with broad strokes, but he perpetrates a straight (and very 70's) stereotype of gay men: "Let's name this one 'Percy', and lets let this one correspond on lavender stationary.
The premise was so implausible as to be laughable.
.
As a fellow attorney, this genre generally appeals to me, and Grisham rarely disappoints.
As I read it, I wasn't thinking about who would be cast in which role, but whether Hollywood would even bother to buy the rights to this book.
In this book, he has created an exception to the rule .
.
there isn't a single likable character in this novel; no underdog who manages to come out ahead .
.
Geez!The book is typical Grisham in that it is very "readable" - but it lacks the wit, the depth, and the PLOT of his previous work.
I've pretty much read all the work Grisham has produced.
.
I can't imagine they would.

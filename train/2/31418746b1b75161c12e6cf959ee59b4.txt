It's an interesting concept, but rather weak.
It was Davenport looking for the killer.
In a few months or so, look in used bookstores, and pick it up for a few bucks, or borrow it from a friend.
Who the killer was....kind of weak.
(See Eyes of Prey and Mind Prey) But with Easy Prey, it wasn't there.
I can't tell you fine readers how much it bothered me.
Maybe, and I mean maybe, get inin paper back.
I *hated* the end!
Okay, this was by far the weakest of the Prey series.
Maybe that's how Sandford wants to portray Davenport, but that maybe a stretch.
I also didn't like the idea that Daavenport was going with 3 women.
Where shall I begin...It seems that Davenport is getting soft.
Whick leads me to another point.
For me what makes a "Prey" book good is the cat and mouse game the killer and Daaavenport play.
If you want my suggestion, don't waste your money on the hardcover.
I can't say much more without ruining a plot line, so I'll just end this point.
Which leads me to my last point.

If you want a game that you can actually put up offense in play WWE RAW 2 for X-BOX.
I for one am glad Hogan and Jeff Hardy are not in this game.
Needless to say we lost the match and I was not the one pinned.
Also,one time Ihad to team with Tazz(IC CHAMP)To face Bret Hart and Ultimate Warrior with both of mine and Tazz's singles titles on the line.
is screwed up.
As for the B & P matches, they are overrated, just like this game.
If you are a challenger, you start with no Specials while th Champ has 1 or 2.
That makes no sense having any singles belts up in any type of tag match.
It only takes that many to beat you.
The A.I.
Season mode is hard as all hell.
All match tyoes really hard and the legends are so lame.
Oh and people, you are not Snoop Dogg and you never will be.So lets just put a stop to that right now.
RAW 2 blows this game out of the water no matter what.
This game is highly overrated and you should go back to playing SD!SYM because HCTP is boring.

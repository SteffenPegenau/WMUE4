Even my 16 yr old nephew with teenage vision says they aren't good.
Right now 2 stars may be generous.
They are sharper.
So they're usable at least in this state.
He prefers the 50 year old set of Bushnells.
They've never been great.
I understand that I may be able to collimate them, and I will try, but I thin they should have been adjusted @ the factory!
However once you zoom, everything becomes distorted again.
I'll adjust them best I can and keep them on the boat.
Once you zoom, forget it.
I get double-imaging even at 10x.
I've had these almost 5 years.
If they fall into the lake I won't shed a tear.UPDATE: This weekend I collimated them as best I could.
I should have just bought a fixed zoom set and saved $20.
50 yrs old and clearer.
@ 10X I got rid of most of the blurriness/double-imaging.
If you need zoom binocs buy a high quality pair.
It's like looking thru a Coke bottle.

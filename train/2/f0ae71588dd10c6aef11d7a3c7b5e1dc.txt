It is great while it works.
I am going back to a regular brewer.
Sounds as though I love them.
Wrong.
3 stopped working within the warranty period and they were replaced by Keurig.
This is my 4th Keurig B70.
They opted to go with another brand.
after warranty.
4 died this morning.
The same thing happened to our daughter and son-in-law.
Keurig offered them a new brewer at 50% off retail.
It is out of warranty.
Just hold your breath.
No.
They have had one replaced and the second one died 1 1/2 mos.
Good Bye Keurig.

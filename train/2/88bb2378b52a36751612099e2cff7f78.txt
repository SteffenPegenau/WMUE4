All the way though, I kept thinking the director wasn't up to the job.
Doh!
After and hour and forty-five minutes I grabbed the DVD box to see which director was responsible for ruining what should have been a cracker.
You can't, there wasn't any gung-honess.
Ho-hum...
It was Clint himself.
It was just too loose.
Things got worse.
Oh and after it was over I suddenly realised that I couldn't remember 1 note from the score.
There might as well have not been one.
Right from the start where the voices didn't quite match the faces of the pilots I was weary.
Still there were 4 top notch actors to watch!
Uh-oh, how could I have not known.
Compare the gung-honess of Armageddon with this?
All the space action passed by without so much as a triumphant fanfare, or any cheering from mission control.

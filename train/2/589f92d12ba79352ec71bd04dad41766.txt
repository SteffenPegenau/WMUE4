Thoughts about an affair?
When I saw that she endorsed it, I wondered why.
Not this one.
I read this before Oprah made it one of her books.
I read it- the whole thing- but I don't think I liked it.
I'm not sure.
I usually like her choices.
The main character seemed to have the perfect man in her life.
And then to get righteous about something that possibly happened in the past,go to the police, and jeopardize that great life?
I can't tell you what was missing but something was.
The story that was meant to draw you in with one woman's conflicting feelings about her past (and maybe her present), rang hollow.
But it was a book that made no sense to me.
Same old plot new characters?
Trite?
Why?
There just wasn't enough MOTIVE for any of the actions the main character took.
Well- guess you'll just have to decide for yourself.

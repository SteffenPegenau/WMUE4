I don't know?
This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
The other actors were stiff and who could blame them.
What happened to him or his nemesis at the end of the film?
There was never a resolution to any question brought up in the film.
The director tried for deep and meaningful with funky shots and sequences but never made it.
The dialogue was unreal.
The only good acting in the entire movie was Seth Green, who was really good.
I don't know.
How did it go wrong?
I mean NO ONE talks like that!
Why was he trying to perform this ceremony?
The plot was ridiculously thin and confusing.
What was the point to anything?
I was bored silly by the movie and I really wanted to like it.
I don't know!
Why was this happening to the lead character?

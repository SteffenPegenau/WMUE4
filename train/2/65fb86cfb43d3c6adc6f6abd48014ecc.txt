The man in black turned out to be Dr. Wynn.
this movie wasn't terrible, BUT are we really supposed to believe that Michael is tied in with a druid cult?
He is in the original for about 5 seconds and now pops up all of the sudden?
If he is so obsessed with Michael, then how come we don't see him until now?
What a shame.
And where in the hell was Tommy Doyle at in Parts 4 &5?
Who in the hell is this guy?
The 1st Halloween worked so well because of it's lack of gore and it was very suspenseful.
I don't think so!
Not "hardcore fans" who like a movie with blood and guts but no plot.
If you really want to be entertained, watch Halloween 1, 2 and H20.
H20 does us all a favor and pretends parts 4, 5,and 6 don't exist.
Now, it seems the more gore a movie has, the scarier it is.
you should to and forget this one!
And you mean to tell me that the Strode family is living in the Myers house and don't EVEN know it's the Myers house?
True fans of Halloween will agree with me.
